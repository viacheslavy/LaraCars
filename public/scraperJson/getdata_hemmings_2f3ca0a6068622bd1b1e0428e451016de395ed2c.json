Overall this powertrain is bad*** and really gets the car going!Upon entering the car the driver will be greeted by a clean black interior. This car does not have very many frills but it is equipped with heat for those colder drives. This sweet ride does also have power steering and power brakes. Overall the interior is in good condition with a few minor imperfections.Moving outward the exterior of the car is is finished in copper colored paint and fitted with Judge trim pieces. The paint and trim are in decent condition with some flaws on the front end. Supporting each corner of the car are rally wheels wrapped in radial tires with decent tread life left.

It is in fact a true Tuxedo Park CJ6A with correct VIN and title, we do know that obviously the chrome bumpers have been replaced, there is no drop down license plate holder and the column shift has been replaced with a floor shift manual.  This Tuxedo Park comes out of the SouthWest and is very clean.  The engine is the original V6.  Now that being said from what we can find, is that only approximately 460 CJ6 models were ever produced, so  just having our hands on one is pretty impressive.  The VIN indicates this as it starts with a prefix of 8422.  This CJ6A starts on a dime and goes down the road as you would suspect.  It has plenty of power and garners attention everywhere you go.  It does not appear to leak or smoke and is very reliable.  The body looks as though it has been restored but has been done nicely.
