This one is the first of the breed with a V8 and a 4-speed.  It has been repainted a beautiful shade of blue-gray that is guaranteed to turn heads and just begs you to get in it, drop the top, and go for a cruise.", "Silver Smoke Gray is the official color of the car.  It is a calming, soothing, color that catches the light nicely in a way that highlights the crisp clean body lines of the car.  There is white GT stripe low on the car between the wheels that really complements the classic white convertible roof when it is up, or the white boot cover when the roof is down.    The bumpers, as well as various other chrome and polished brightwork pieces, add a tasteful splash of flash to this car.  Of course, there is large running Mustang front and center on the grill.  The front fenders have 2 more smaller ponies backed by red, white, and blue stripes, and 289 badging announcing what is under the hood.  The clean lines of the back of the car are finished off with chrome exhaust tips, and the whole package sits on chrome Magnum wheels with Mustang center caps.", "The white roof is classy and really looks great when it's up, but getting in and hitting the button to drop the top brings the sky and your surroundings in. The blue interior of this car really compliments the paint color.  Door panels that are pleated match the seats for a complimentary look.  A sculpted, stock dash looks great and helps keep the gauges shaded from the sun, especially while top down motoring.  The stock radio is even still in place and has a cool Mustang graphic running across the face of it. Settle into the bucket seat, and feel that 3 spoke black and chrome steering wheel in your hand.  Hit the key and reach for the floor shifter to get this car in gear and get it rolling.  Enjoy an escape ride for yourself, because convertibles are good for that, or load up your friends and head out for some fun, because top down motoring is fun no matter how you do it.", "The sweet 289 cubic inch engine in this car is just what the doctor ordered.  And it's also the way it was originally ordered.  This engine makes great power and wants to run, revving freely when you ask it to.  There are a few nice touches like gold valve covers and master cylinder cap along with a polished air filter housing dressing up the engine bay.  The power it makes flows back through a 4-speed transmission letting you pick the gear you want to be in for cruising, and a leaf spring rear end gets the power transferred to the ground.   Front disc brakes provide great stopping power to reign in those ponies as needed, and steering control comes from a control arms suspension with coils springs and a sway bar to keep the front end planted on twisty back roads.  The 215/75R14 tires front and rear work well and the whole package is balanced making this car a joy to drive.", "Settle into the seat, and take a spin.

Add in a beefy suspension and some giant disc brakes and you have one of the coolest early Mustang resto-mods we've ever seen.", "There's a pretty extensive magazine spread on this car, and given the eyeball-popping Ferrari Fly Yellow paint, that shouldn't be surprising. Starting with a clean coupe, everything was taken apart, massaged, smoothed, and refinished to give you the incredible car you see today. It's still early Mustang, there's no doubt about that, but with the neatly integrated Shelby-style hood and side vents and a lot of shaved trim, it takes on a very purposeful look. Fit and finish are quite good, certainly better than when these cars were new, and there's still plenty of chrome, so you don't have to worry about its identity getting erased. No stripes, spoilers, or other add-ons were needed to give it a trick look, although there is a neat flip-up fuel filler cap on the rear panel, which balances the Shelby hood up front. A mesh grille and a functional cut-out in the lower valence give the front end a race-ready look that really works well on the neat little coupe. This is a really impressive car.", "At a glance, the interior looks pretty stock, well, except for the bright yellow door panels and dash. However, the seats are stock Mustang buckets, there's no console, and while the gauges are modern, the instrument panel is standard Mustang. Heck, even the woodgrained steering wheel is something you would have seen in 1965. However, the upgrades are there to help make the car work better, so you have a full array of Auto Meter dials, including a pair on the A-pillar, so it's easy to monitor the blown small block under the hood. A Pioneer AM/FM/CD/Bluetooth stereo system uses kick panel and package shelf speakers plus a pair of subwoofers with trick enclosures in the trunk to fill the cabin with sound. New carpets, billet pedals, and a 5-speed shifter help with the complete, ready-to-go look. The trunk is a show piece all by itself, so make sure you open it up at shows, because people are really going to want to see this!", "The engine is a 289 cubic inch V8, bored and stroked all the way to 347 cubic inches. But just in case that isn't enough for you, there's a Paxton Novi 2000 supercharger that pressurizes the stout small block with nine pounds of boost. Don't worry, the steel Scat crank and forged I-beam rods don't mind and the aluminum Edelbrock heads help build plenty of horsepower. A full roller valvetrain from Comp Cams gives it that wicked sound and an MSD ignition system lights it all up. Lots of shiny chrome and billet aluminum under the hood make it look ready to show but with a new Tremec 5-speed manual transmission and new driver friendly clutch, you're probably going to want to go instead of show. A 9-inch rear end with 3.55 gears inside is plenty for the supercharged motor and it's been upgraded with giant Wilwood disc brakes up front, tubular A-arms, and a rack-and-pinion steering system to keep it all under control. 17-inch in the front and 18-inch in the rear Foose Torque Thrust wheels fill the fenders with 245/40/17 and 285/35/18 Nitto performance radials and adjustable rear air shocks.", "Check out the workmanship and the hardware, then look again at the price.

It's got all the features you want (power top, power steering, A/C, and a 289) plus a color combination that looks great and stands out in a crowd.", "Quite honestly, there's nobody out there who doesn't like the early Mustangs. Even Camaro guys have to admit that they're neat little cars and whenever you're driving one, well, life seems a little brighter. That's why we like this one so much, because the bright yellow paint is impossible not to love (it was originally code R Ivy Green). It embodies the spirit of the Mustang, playful and fun, without taking itself too seriously. Fortunately, the bodywork is quite good underneath and it appears to have lived its entire life down south, so it's tidy underneath. Mustang convertibles can sometimes be tricky to restore with their unit-body structures, but this one fits together quite nicely and with a relatively recent repaint, it shines up well. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But it does have a wonderfully casual look that's a big part of its appeal.", "The black Pony interior contrasts brilliantly with the yellow bodywork and remains as inviting as ever. Given that it was originally equipped with a standard interior, almost everything is new and today it shows only very minor signs of use that are more about character than show-worthiness. The GT-style dashboard covers the vitals and a correct early-style Rally-Pac has been fitted to the steering column. The shifter for the 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission sits proudly on the transmission tunnel, sans console, and there's a period aftermarket A/C system hanging under the dash (needs to be serviced). The woodgrained finish on the dash is in remarkably good condition given the age of the car and the only major modification inside might be the newer AM/FM/cassette radio in the center of the dash. Other neat features include a aftermarket cruise control and a white power convertible top that's in very good condition and offers a matching boot for when it's stowed. The trunk is correctly outfitted with a reproduction mat and spare tire cover so it looks right.", "There's no way to determine if an early Mustang like this is ''matching-numbers'' in the technical sense, but the C-code 289 currently living under the hood looks quite correct and brightly detailed. The C-code cars had 2-barrel carburetors, but this one now carries a fresh 4-barrel, perhaps in the quest for more horsepower, which is never a bad idea. It's quite neatly done, with finned Edelbrock dress-up parts and chrome Monte Carlo bar atop a correct black engine block. It starts easily and feels smooth and torquey, so this Mustang is a great travelling partner no matter where you're going. Power steering is a rather important option, even on a lightweight Mustang, and the automatic transmission teams up with 2.80 gears to make it an awesome highway cruiser. A proper dual exhaust system has a nice V8 burble to it and thanks to a lifetime in a warm climate, the undercarriage is in very good original condition. Handsome styled steel wheels with 205/70/14 blackwall radials are the perfect rolling stock on this bright little ragtop.", "This car gets a lot of things right, and we can guarantee that if you like the color, you're going to love the rest of the car.

It was repainted at some point, but the color is pretty close to Signalflare Red, which was on the color charts in 1966, so it looks right. It appears that the bodywork underneath was in great shape and nothing has changed in the intervening 50 years, with crisp lines, good alignment, and doors that open and close with reassuring precision. Not trying to be something it isn't, there are no Shelby stripes or even fake GT badges, although it does have a GT rear valence with exhaust trumpets poking through, a look that really should have been standard equipment.

Low back buckets wear correct reproduction seat covers with pleated inserts, and they flank a factory center console with the T-handle shifter. The carpets, dash, and door panels are equally nice and don't look like they've spent decades in the hot sun, so they have surely been replaced along the way, too. Factory instruments in the 5-gauge panel that became standard in '66 look good, and that's a correct 3-spoke steering wheel grip. The factory AM radio is still in the middle of the dash, but it's ready to be replaced by something a bit more contemporary. The black convertible top is in decent shape but looks like it's spent a lot of time folded under the contrasting white boot. Open the trunk and you'll find a reproduction mat, which is sitting on top of a brand new gas tank (yes, the gas tank is the floor of a Mustang's trunk).", "Ford wasn't doing the matching numbers thing in 1966, so we can't tell you whether this is the original 289, but it looks quite correct and has that wonderful small block Ford sound that is a big part of the Mustang's appeal. This is a real C-code car, so all the hardware around it is suitably beefy for the V8's power output (unlike the converted 6-cylinder cars), and it has been smartly upgraded with a 4-barrel carburetor for a bit more power. A few dress-up items like valve covers, red wires, and an open-element air cleaner give it a slightly custom look. It's backed by an effortless C4 3-speed automatic transmission and 3.00 gears out back, so cruising is low-effort, but the engine's torque makes it a lot of fun, and a fresh front disc brake set-up helps you stop. The underside is unrestored, but you can see what we mean about this car taking it easy for the past few decades, and a burbling dual exhaust system gives it just the right soundtrack to earn its Mustang credentials. Factory steel wheels with wire hubcaps and 195/75/14 whitewalls add to the cheerful look.", "This is the new baseline for V8 Mustang convertibles, and they're only going up from here.

Featuring a lower profile, and a wider stance than what the public was used to seeing, it was so distinct that it required its own classification that would soon be shared with other models: the muscle car. This 1965 Ford Mustang combines the sporty good looks that made the Mustang a true iconic automobile with just a few modifications that really make it stand out in a crowd.", "Immortalized in song and movies alike, the first-generation Mustang is unmistakable to anyone with even a passing interest in classic cars, and yet you'll notice that this one looks both reassuringly familiar and yet substantially different from most you'll see out on the road or ensconced in garages. The maroon shade of the exterior works well for a vintage Mustang \u2013 subdued enough to show respect for the model and yet distinct enough to underscore the custom look. Up front, a Shelby GT350 style bumper with a pair of signature Shelby fog lamps sits in place of the original, its painted surface and distinct center gap fitting in well with the surrounding panels. A well-crafted scoop with graceful curvature crowns the hood and a pair of rear scoops assume their Shelby-inspired position just in front of the rear wheels. The chrome on the rear bumper, as well as the bezels and trim, including the FORD lettering on the hood, look fresh, with no scuffs or dings and the tinted glass throughout is nice and clear. This first-generation Pony has an aggressive inclined stance befitting its performance-oriented inspiration.", "Inside, the black vinyl upholstery shows very little wear and solid stitching in both the front buckets and back bench seat. A well-matched center console has been added, its well-padded lid high enough to serve as a comfortable arm rest while driving and also providing a substantial amount of extra storage space. Behind the stock Mustang spoked steering wheel, the original gauges are fully functional and occupy their positions inside the stock bezel, with the broad, first generation speedometer still carrying a respectably clear lens.  Above them, the black dash pad sits, still level and supple-looking with no cracks or warpage, and below the controls for the wipers, headlights, and lighter all sit snugly in their bezels. The expanse of black carpeting under the seating has plenty of life left and shows no tears or heel marks.", "Under the hood, you'll find a 289 V8, just as the well-equipped ponies of this year started life with. Paired with a 3 speed automatic transmission, the small block starts right up, idles smoothly and has been upgraded with an Edelbrock intake and carb and a chrome air cleaner. A set of Flowmaster mufflers give it a nice throaty exhaust tone.  Another practical upgrade is the Monte Carlo bar spanning from side to side inside the engine compartment just in front of the shock towers, providing a substantial amount of welcomed rigidity in front for this unibody car. It's a nicely detailed engine compartment with no errant wires, but good, fresh-looking belts and hoses and grime-free flat black walls. This venerable pony sits on a set of 5 spoke rims with Mustang centers, wrapped in Hankook Optimo tires.", "Looking for a classic muscle car that features a handful of well-selected modifications for a truly unique, yet era-appropriate look?
