The wheelbase and body were unchanged as were the body styles, a 2+2 or BT7 and two-seater BN7.", "Engines fitted with three SU HS4 carburetors and an improved camshaft were announced at the end of May 1961. Other changes included a vertical barred front grille. Optional extras were similar to the Mark I. From August 1961, a brake servo was also available as an optional extra, which greatly improved braking performance.", "The 3000 sports convertible Mark II was launched at the end of August 1962 it was a true convertible with almost saloon car comfort, a new wrap-around windscreen, wind-up side windows, swiveling quarter lights and a never used folding roof still in its package as well as brand new side curtains. Twin SU HS6 carburetors replaced the triple SUs. Austin Healey claimed it could exceed 115 mph.", "11,564 Mark IIs were made: 355 BN7 open two seaters, 5,096 BT7 2+2s and 6,113 BJ7 2+2 sports convertibles.", "The BT 7 Mark II is the last true roadster. It distinguishes itself from the BN 7, as it is a 2 plus 2 Model, meaning it has front and rear seats.", "This car sports triple SUH-4 carburetors, a folding roof, chrome wire wheels, heater, a laminated windscreen, and two-tone paint. It also has a tonneau that covers both front and rear seats.", "It is a matching numbers example that runs fast, smooth and straight. Its proper muffler gives it a rumbling sound that any enthusiast loves to hear going down the road. It is not for the faint of heart, as it is capable of reaching a top speed of 112 mph and can accelerate from 0-60 in 10.9 seconds.", "This car benefitted from a frame of restoration 12 years ago, and has been expertly maintained by its current owner. The paint is excellent; the chrome shows slight wear, but no pitting. The undercarriage and chassis is clean and shows no evidence of rust or wear.

The car starts easily and accelerates very strongly, the clutch is smooth and strong, the transmission shifts crisply into all 4 gears, the brakes a powerful and stop the car quickly with no drama!   The feel of the car, the fit of the doors, the switch gear, the sound all have the feel of a well trained and assured athlete performing at the top of their game.

We encourage you to come check this fine example out for yourself, the car is exceptionally well presented.The Austin-Healeys were the result of an unusual collaboration between sports car builder Donald Healey and Austin, a major producer of the small sedans that were so popular in postwar Europe. Healey had been a successful rally driver in the 1920s and technical director of Triumph in the 1930s, but he set out on his own as soon as WWII ended. The first Healeys featured a proprietary chassis and body but were powered by a variety of engines, including those from Riley, Alvis, and Nash. In 1952 BMC (Austin's parent company) staged a competition to generate designs for a new sports car based on Austin mechanicals, and Donald Healey's 'Hundred' was selected as the winning entry.For more information, or to arrange for a private viewing of this splendid 1967 Austin Healey 3000 BJ8 Roadster, or any of our 100+ Classic, Exotic and Special Interest Sports Cars always in stock, please contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or always feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.

When most sports cars where a 4 cylinder these are a 6 cylinder, and had just an unusual amount of power for the times. It was built in fairly small volume, and a combination of steel and aluminum construction. This car also has a unique story. The current owner spotted this car when it was only 5 or 6 years old at a British Layland dealership in his home town, and had inquired about it and really wanted to own it. The owner eventually sold it to him in January 1971, and its still titled with the original title from 1971 when it was put in his name 46 years ago. The fact that its not only received professional attention to the paint and body, but was restored to be driven and enjoyed even though he had very limited time to do that.  That is why it is in such remarkable condition today. 2 years ago the car was taken in and was asked that they completely go through the suspension and freshen it with new brakes, brake drums, pads, rotors, shock absorbers, and other suspension components.

We bought this from the former President of the Austin Healy Sprite club of America. The car was his daughter\u2019s driver and as such was in great driving condition, we did the upholstery and stripped it to the bare metal and painted with a high quality Base coat Clear coat Paint.

Sounds good too with the factory style exhaust system. The engine is backed by the Original four speed manual transmission and Original Rear Axle. After driving it in this 100+ weather we have been having I decided to add an electric fan, never had any overheating issues just wanted to have that extra option. No modifications were done to the car so it could be removed if you wanted to keep it original. The brakes were converted to Disc Brakes in the front. The New interior is beautiful, including, NEW ORIGINAL style Black vinyl front bucket seats, new Black carpeting, a VERY NICE ORIGINAL Sprite steering wheel, VERY NICE ORIGINAL  matching Black vinyl door panels, VERY NICE ORIGINAL Black vinyl dash, VERY NICE Painted dash, VERY NICE ORIGINAL gauge cluster including a working factory tachometer. This Sprite is nicely equipped including factory gauge package including tachometer, original heater and defroster, original rear view mirror. This car is a great running and wonderful looking Austin Healy Sprite Roadster. This Austin Healy Sprite Roadster has sharp looks, good power! These vehicles have an appreciative group of owners any of which would be pleased to own this one. The suspension and drive train are in good working order as well as the electrical system. All the lights work including headlights, taillights. Speaking of lights all of the ORIGINAL light and reflector lenses are clear, bright and uncracked and in BEAUTIFUL condition. The trunk compartment is also nice and clean.", " ", "This Austin Healy Sprite is a great investment opportunity and it is priced right!

The Cherry Red Basecoat/Clearcoat exterior finish on this vehicle is cut and polished to a high Shine, showing only a few very very small imperfections and is STUNNING as you can clearly see in the pictures! As for the body; the hood, doors, hand stripped and professionally repaired and painted by the shop that built the car that won \u201cbest of Show\u201d at the biggest show in the US and Biggest Mopar show in 2010.
