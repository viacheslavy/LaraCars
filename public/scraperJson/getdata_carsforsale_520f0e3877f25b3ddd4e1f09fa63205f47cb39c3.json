The turbocharged 3.8 L became standard and was refined with sequential fuel injection, distributor-less computer controlled ignition, and boasted 200 hp (150 kW) at 4400 rpm and 300 lb\u00b7ft (407 N\u00b7m) of torque at 2400 rpm. Only 5,204 Turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year production of the computer controlled Sequential Fuel Injection and Distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year/model that started the development of the legendary intercooled Grand Nationals. The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the \u201cLittle V6\u201d easily kept up with the bigger V8\u2019s. Quarter mile (~400 m) performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of 10 psi (0.69 bar), while for the same year, the Chevrolet Camaro was listed at 17.0 and the Chevrolet Corvette at 15.2 seconds.  Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. All Grand Nationals for this year had the Lear Siegler-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the T-Top option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals"], "title": "1984 Buick Regal ", "total_results": "1422", "price": "14900", "kilometers": 63491.14, "total_pages": 61, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27977255", "brand": "Buick", "reference_id": "27977255", "year": "1984", "model": "Regal", "specs": {"Engine": "3.8L V6 Turbo", "Mileage": "39,460 miles", "Exterior Color": "Black", "Transmission": "Automatic 4-Speed", "Interior Color": "Gray", "Drive Train": "RWD", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

But if you want one with a manual transmission, well, that narrows it down to this Euro-spec 1985 Mercedes-Benz 280SL. With all the same style and reliability that made these cars famous, plus a unique look and a sweet 5-speed gearbox, this might be the one to own if you're a guy who loves to drive.  ", "  For years, the Europeans kept all the good stuff for themselves. US regulations gave us big, heavy rubber bumpers and antiquated headlights, but in Europe, the SL was wearing svelte chrome-rimmed bumpers and halogen headlights that totally transformed the R107's look. This bright white 280SL is an ideal example of the undiluted look that Americans never see and it stands out in a big way, even today. Looking vastly more modern than its thirty years would suggest, it shows the same fantastic build quality for which these cars are famous, as well as careful maintenance that has kept it in top condition. The paint has a wonderful luster that definitely suggests great wealth, and while it shows some signs of age, it remains the kind of car that gets attention everywhere it goes. Yes, the Euro bumpers are excellent, the headlights are clear, and the rest of the trim is in first-rate condition, although the gold-plated grille was probably added after it arrived on our shores.  ", "  It also includes a black MB-Tex interior, which is original and shows just how durable the Mercedes upholstery really is. Contrasting perfectly with the white paint, it's elegant and sporty, just like the rest of the car, and especially well preserved. Sure, it's a little odd to see a 5-speed manual shifter sticking out of the console and three pedals on the floor, but otherwise it's a traditional SL with a no-nonsense dashboard and that intangible feeling of quality throughout. The instruments all work properly, and this one is loaded with features like A/C, power windows, and real wood trim, just as you'd expect from the top-of-the-line Mercedes. The seats are in excellent shape with just gentle comfort marks on their faces, the dash is unaffected by UV rays, and the door panels and rear package shelf are nearly new. The original radio is gone, replaced by an AM/FM/CD stereo head unit that sounds great and about the only complaint we have is that the odometer seems to have stopped working at some point, so we don't know the mileage. A black canvas convertible top stows under a hard rear tonneau, and a removable hardtop was standard equipment.   ", "  Despite giving up some displacement to the usual V8-powered SLs, the 2.8 liter DOHC inline six does a fantastic job of moving the roadster when linked to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine bay is neatly finished, and you'll note a refreshing lack of pesky emissions equipment to get in your way, all due to the European specifications. Recent work includes a new fuel pump and accumulator, a clean gas tank, and the usual plugs, wires, and ignition parts, "], "title": "1985 Mercedes-Benz 280-Class ", "total_results": "1422", "price": "12995", "kilometers": 25555.747, "total_pages": 61, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29663926", "brand": "Mercedes-Benz", "reference_id": "29663926", "year": "1985", "model": "280-Class", "specs": {"Engine": "2.8 I6", "Mileage": "15,883 miles", "Exterior Color": "White", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}}
