This is a tribute to that you are not going to be able to to resist driving and why should you that is what it was built for. The badges on the outside may say 396 but that is not what is lurking under the hood. What is ready to be unleashed is built 454 Cubic inch crate monster that was topped with a matched kit of Edelbrock cylinder heads cam intake manifold and carb. The estimated horsepower is over 500 not too shabby. Behind that is a lightened flywheel so revs move quickly a performance clutch connects this monster engine to the Tremec 5 speed manual and the gears are controlled through a Hurst shifter. Power is then transferred to the rear end which is a GM 12 bolt unit that is factory built to handle the power. So you may be thinking with all of this power you have to be able to get it to the ground somehow well that has been thought of as well. A complete UMI tubular suspension has been put into place so this thing is going to take some corners as well. QA1 Coilovers control the front dampening and spring rate and height with lowering springs in the rear with AC Delco shocks. Braking has been upgraded as well with drilled and slotted front rotors and a more aggressive brake pads. All power by the way.\u00a0You may have noticed the paint is a color you have to behold a beautiful shade of metallic blue and the perfect white accent stripe to go along with it. The chrome and stainless trim is in excellent condition as are the emblems. This is a true head turner. The interior has not gone untouched with new carpet reconditioned trim and a new headliner. This is a true gem and a true pleasure to drive and makes all of the right noises.\u00a0If you would like to know more please contact us.\u00a0Financing is availableVisit Cityview Classic Cars online at www.cityviewclassiccars.com to see more pictures of this vehicle or call us at 817-292-4477 today."], "Mileage:": "92541"}},

The 1970 Chevelle shared many sheet metal body parts with the 1970 Buick Skylark GSX, both are GM automobiles and have interchangeable sheet metal. They are also the only two muscle cars to share the same roofline. The 1970 Chevelle came in sport coupe, sport sedan, convertible, four-door sedan, a couple of wagons, and coup\u00e9 utility (the El Camino) body styles. Only three of these (Malibu sport coupe, Malibu convertible and El Camino pickup) were available with a choice of one of 2 SS options; RPO Z25 with the SS 396 (402 cid) engine and RPO Z15 with the new 454 cid engine. The base model was now simply called Chevelle in lieu of the former base 300 Deluxe, and was only available as a Sport Coupe or four-door sedan. In Canada, the base series retained its 300 Deluxe name, with appropriate badging on each front fender just behind the front wheel well. The hardtop, convertible, and sedan received the upgraded sheetmetal but the station wagons and El Camino retained the previous year sheetmetal panels (which went on for the next 2 model years). Station wagons were the entry level Nomad, the Chevelle level Greenbrier, the Malibu level Concours and an upscale Concours Estate. New options included power door locks and a stalk-mounted wiper control.", "The SS 396 Chevelle included a 350 horsepower (260 kW) Turbo-Jet 396 V8, special suspension, ''power dome'' hood, black-accented grille, resilient rear-bumper insert, and wide-oval tires on sport wheels. Though a 375 horsepower (280 kW) cowl induction version was available, few were sold in favor of the newly introduced 454 engine during late-1969 timeframe. The LS5 454-cubic-inch V8 produced 360 horsepower (270 kW) in standard form and a cowl induction version was also available. The LS6 produced a claimed 450 gross HP in solid-lifter, high-compression guise.", "''You can make our tough one even tougher,'' the brochure explained, by adding Cowl Induction to either the SS 396 or the SS 454. Step on the gas, and a scoop opened ''to shoot an extra breath of cool air into the engine air intake....like second wind to a distance runner.'' Neither functional hood lock pins nor hood and deck stripes were standard with either SS option, but were part of the optional ZL2 cowl induction hood option. The 454 cu in (7.4 L) LS5 V8 was rated at 360 hp (270 kW)."], "Exterior:": "Black", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "19811"}}
