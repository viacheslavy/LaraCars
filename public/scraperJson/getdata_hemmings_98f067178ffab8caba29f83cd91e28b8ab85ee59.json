This motor runs like a top!  Everything looks clean and there are signs of regular maintenance evident with a fresh-looking battery and tune up items like cap, wires and plugs.  Power steering is a nice feature with those bigger tires, and an Edelbrock air filter housing makes it easy to change the element.  A 4-speed transmission gets the power distributed, of course with the option of high or low range through the transfer case, and there are nice skid plates protecting the oil pan, transmission and fuel tank from damage.
