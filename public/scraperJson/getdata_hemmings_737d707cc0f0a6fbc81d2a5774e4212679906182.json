Here's a 1968 Mustang convertible that we just got in and is now available to purchase.  This vehicle came to us from the southern Iowa area where it spent is entire life. (DSO was also Des Moines)  The previous owners had this car for  a little more than 20 Years and as they got older the car didn't get driven as much so it was time to part with it.  This Mustang is nicely  equipped with power brakes, and a power top that is in working order.  If you take a look  under the hood you'll find a 200 inline 6 paired with a automatic transmission just as it would have came from Ford.  The color code on this car in N so it was a Diamond Blue car and has had a repaint in the past.  This is a very interesting color that appears to be white but has a blue cast to it   The interior appears to be in nice shape and is still the original Lt. Blue Vinyl with Dark Blue Kiwi Vinyl standard interior.  We would consider this a driver quality car that will have a few blemishes, nics, scratches, crack  in the paint/body and would be great for cruising to roll ins or just out for an afternoon in the sun.  You can take a look at the pics and video provide to see the tidy engine bay, trunk, interior.
