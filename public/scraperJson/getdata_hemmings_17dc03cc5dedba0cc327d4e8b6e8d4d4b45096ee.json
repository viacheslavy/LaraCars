This 1972 Camaro Rally Sport is no ordinary second generation Rally car.  This power house was originally born with a 350 cu inch V-8 with a 2 barrel carburetor and TH350 Automatic transmission. This balanced assembly was machined and assembled with the best internal parts by a very reputable race car engine builder and has less than 600 miles since the overhaul. In the last eighteen months the car has had a complete drive train update.  The motor is a new SBC 383 Stroker 3.750 stroke with SBC flat top race series pistons, ZR forged steel crankshaft, H-Beam connecting rods, Dart Iron Eagle cast iron heads, double roller timing chain, high pressure oil pump, Arp hardened bolts Comp cam and an RPM aluminum intake with a new Quick fuel SS 650 CFM solid state electronic choke . The SS series was manufactured from aluminum and has billet valve bodies-  all state of the art stuff in performance carbs.  This car  also has a Holley mechanical fuel pump - none of those buzzy sounding electric pumps here! Way too much to list, but a complete listing of the engine specs would include:  Headers, Moroso HEI ignition with built in advance module ,Moroso spark plug wires with spark plug socks, Spectre fresh air intake tube with K & N air filter, high volume power steering pump with separate reservoir, 4 core radiator w/electric fan which is thermostatically controlled with adjustable settings . This car is also equipped with for wheel disc brakes,SSBC calipers, slotted drilled rotors, Hotchkis sub frame connectors, Th 350 transmission with a 2500 stall converter and a TCI manual valve body. The clutches used in this transmission were also used in Funny Cars-  they are called Blue Plates, which are also often used in Alcohol Cars- so, in other words, it was built for one thing in mind; muscle and speed; a REAL street fighter, with  a professionally built automatic which can make a huge difference when it comes to performance!! The rear is a 10 bolt with Motive gear axles, Eaton posi traction performance differential,  3.73 gears and ARP hardened bolts . THIS CAR IS READY FOR THE STREET OR THE STRIP!! The car's exterior body and paint are exceptionally nice with front & rear spoilers , all new tinted glass, restored brightwork & stainless upgraded Billet Aluminum front grille, which includes the original grille, and stock wheels that are nicely done (but not shown) all give this car a stock factory appearance.  The wheels that are shown are optional and we tried them on for size;  they are Cragar SS 50th anniversary vintage look wheels that are brand new, mounted BF Goodrich P275/60 R15\u201d in the rear, which gives this car a bad ass look that and it's jacked up appearance.  It's got P215/70 R15\u2019\u2019up front.  The car is solid and as straight as they come with a high gloss wet look to the paint that really jumps out at you.  It's a no brainer! The interior is equally as cool;  stunning  with super nice Strato bucket seats, console with it's staple shifter,  a full set of GM seat belts to hold you into this rocket and a Lacarra billet leather wrapped steering wheel.  (The original is also included). You\u2019ll notice the auto meter oil & temp gauge are tastefully installed, a functional factory tach, speedometer, interior lights, wipers, etc. For cranking up tunes, check out the Kenwood CD player with MP3 ,Sirius XM, and Blue Tooth - this car will totally rock you!  This performance car will make a statement wherever you go with it's nicely tuned exhaust system which isn't too loud or overbearing.  It's got 2 \u00bd  X pipe with a single transverse mounted Flow Master muffler, which really gives this car a nice purrrrrrr!  BUCKLE IN KIDS!  THIS ONE'S A REAL SCREAMER!!! Comes with all receipts totaling over $20,000 - just in the drive train  alone,  in the last 18 Months.  This car has over $50,000 invested in it and it shows well....Don't wait....she's selling at a very realistic $36,900"], "Mileage:": "1111"}},

While the serious V8 power under the hood will make everyone else might fear the growl of this coupe, its extra shot of nitro will leave you all smiles.", "With less than 2,200 miles since this wicked machine was built, you get an exceptionally fresh presentation.  The modern clear coat gives the silver an extra luster.  Plus, the black painted stripes help highlight the cowl-induction hood and full-width rear spoiler.  Chrome is used sparingly, so areas like the rocker panels, nicely contoured rear bumper, and upgrade to the iconic split front bumper were pieces that all received the proper attention during restoration.  Overall, you can tell someone took their time getting this car right.  That's why the creases in the sheet metal run through the panels like an unbroken line.  This level of attention makes sense when it's one of only 2575 real-deal Z/28 built that year.", "The exterior stripes are a great intro to the black carpets, door panels, dash, center console, and bucket seats that await inside. GM designers nailed it with the second-generation Camaro's interior with a driver-oriented package that's still desirable in modern times.  And while those are great original-style pieces, there are also plenty of the right updates.   For example, the gauges are now a modern full AutoMeter Phantom package (the original panel comes with the sale, too.)  Plus, the shifter is a sturdy Hurst unit.  There's an upgrade to a Kenwood AM/FM/cassette stereo, we bet your favorite soundtrack is really the growl you get every time you twist the key.", "While we love the tidy setup of the 350 cubic-inch V8, and the shining air topper and valve covers are always attention-grabbers, the thunderous exhaust note instantly tells you this is no tame show car.  This small block was built for combat thanks to a 383 crank with .30 bore.  Plus, the big Holley Red four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, Edelbrock heads, and long tube headers add to this full performance build.  And oh yeah, it's fully setup for nitrous.  You have complete control over this seriously quick street machine thanks to the Muncie M20 four-speed manual transmission (owner states it's original to this Z-car.)  Plus, the 4.11 rear end is there to ensure power takeoffs.  This coupe also has all the right driving features such as power steering, power brakes with disc up front, sway bars front & rear, and BF Goodrich T/As on correct Z/28 15-inch wheels.", "This is an amazing build that's made to go fast and to look fierce doing it.  It's the one-of-a-kind Z/28 Camaro you can't forget, and so it will haunt you if you miss out.  Call today!!!"], "Exterior:": "Silver", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "2125"}},

It's a real deal, numbers matching car that was one of the first ones built in January of '72.  January 3rd to be exact.  Let's dive into some details so you can see how special this car is.  Then call our dealership to arrange an up close and personal look at it right away.  A car like this one probably won't stick around for long.", "Delivered from the factory, and presented today in the correct, paint code 53 53 Placer Gold, and YF8 Black Z/28 stripes, this car looks fantastic.  Behind the first-class finish of the paint is hours of prep by skilled craftsmen.  This whole build respected the 7 Ps of performance.  ''Proper prior preparation prevents piss poor performance''.  The body panels were all adjusted so they have tight, consistent gaps, and the body lines are all crisp and clean, flowing seamlessly from one to another.   The only badging on this car is the correct, Z/28 badging on the grill, front fenders, and on the trunk just below that iconic rear spoiler.  Then there is one ''Camaro'' in script on the hood.  All the chrome and brightwork shines like new.  The thin chrome bumpers front and rear are joined by a nice chrome strip along the rocker panel.  All the light bezels and window moldings show off the result of lots of elbow grease.  And you gotta love those stock Rally wheels.", "The inside of this car is all stock, trim code 775 Black standard.  It all looks great with no rips or tears anywhere.  The A51 bucket seats are comfortable, offer great support, and look good too with their multiple sections of pleated upholstery.  There is a factory 8,000 rpm tachometer set in the instrument cluster that wraps around the driver like it should, because, these second gen cars took lessons learned from racing and improved the breed when they redesigned them.  The shifter for the factory original, Muncie 4-speed trans, is reaching up out of the tunnel just begging to be grabbed and put through its paces, (by you maybe?).  The headliner is taught and clean and the carpets are in great condition, currently protected by floor mats.  An original style AM/FM Delco radio is there for your listening pleasure, or, you might prefer listening to the sound of the exhaust as you stir that gearbox around.", "12N156439.  That's the number on the engine which matches the VIN of the car, making it one of those desirable, elusive, and precious ''matching numbers'' Z/28s.  The engine bay is detailed out nicely and is about spotless top to bottom.  The correct dual snorkel air cleaner housing tops the engine in all its shiny glory.  There is a Holley 4bbl carb, list-4779 1023 which we have not been able to positively ID as factory original, but is definitely period correct.  There are two bolt on engine components that are not factory original.  The GM Winters intake manifold, and the Doug's long tube headers.  Both are quality pieces that boost performance, and both could be retrofitted to original if you wanted to pursue that.  The trans is code P2S29A with the same 12N156439 partial VIN as the engine which makes it the aluminum cased Muncie that the car was delivered with. The differential code of CB-G003-1-G, makes it a 4.10 gear ratio, with a G&A Positraction carrier, produced on the 3rd day of January, just like the car.  Set all this awesome on those Rally wheels shod with the correct F60-15 Goodyear Polyglass GT biased ply tires, and you are looking at one very historically correct, collectible car.", "You could make it yours and park it in your garage if you wish.  But call now.  Others may be wishing for the same thing."], "Exterior:": "Placer Gold", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "44576"}},

The 2nd generation Camaro was a huge success for GM running a total of 11 years. The fastback body design with its huge rear glass was a far cry from the 1ST Generation. This beautiful Silver with Black stripes split bumper actually began life as a SS396 which is super cool. The 396 has been replaced with a monster 496 that was built with one thing in mind going fast in a straight line! The Brodix heads are made out of aluminum with many saying they are the best in the business. The huge aluminum radiator keeps everything at the perfect operating temperature with dual electric fans giving you that extra vote of confidence. The 1050 CFM Quick Fuel Dominator carb feeds this animal the high-octane gas it needs. If that\"??s not enough power for you hit the button on the fogger system and hold on for dear life. The TH350 Transmission was built to handle all that power with a trans brake allowing for true off the line hole shots. The Moser 10 bolt rear end has 3.89 Moser axles allowing for off the line acceleration while pulling hard through all 3 gears. With all that power propelling this beauty the brakes need to be just as good. The 4-wheel disc set up with its Wilwood master cylinder is exactly what this thing needed. Of course going fast is fun but why not look good while doing it? The paint on the car is slick with a great shine while that fiberglass cowl hood ties in perfectly to the build. The RS front clip looks great but there is no way to tell if it came from the factory or not. Open the doors and you will see an interior that is very tasteful. The roll cage was done to keep you safe while still allowing for plenty of room. The front buckets are comfortable and look right at home with the racing harnesses keeping you right where you need to be. The ratchet style shifter is just where you want it allowing for quick shifts with a simple slap. Normally when cars like this are built you get either a car that looks great but lacks in the performance department or vice versa. Why not get this one and have a beautiful car that performs like it looks? Options on this 1972 Camaro include AM/FM/CD Power Steering Vinyl Interior Seat Belts and Billet Wheels with Radial Tires.
