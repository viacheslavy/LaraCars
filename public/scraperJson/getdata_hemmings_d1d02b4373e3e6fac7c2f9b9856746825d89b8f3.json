We encourage you to come check this fine example out for yourself.The Austin-Healeys were the result of an unusual collaboration between sports car builder Donald Healey and Austin, a major producer of the small sedans that were so popular in postwar Europe. Healey had been a successful rally driver in the 1920s and technical director of Triumph in the 1930s, but he set out on his own as soon as WWII ended. The first Healeys featured a proprietary chassis and body but were powered by a variety of engines, including those from Riley, Alvis, and Nash. In 1952 BMC (Austin's parent company) staged a competition to generate designs for a new sports car based on Austin mechanicals, and Donald Healey's 'Hundred' was selected as the winning entry.For more information, or to arrange for a private viewing of this splendid 1967 Austin Healey 3000 BJ8 Roadster, or any of our 100+ Classic, Exotic and Special Interest Sports Cars always in stock, please contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or always feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.

Small, tossable and extremely fun right out of the box, this freshly finished roadster is a virtually spotless classic that was professionally rebuilt by premier marque specialist Kurt Tanner. 1 of only 17,712 Mark IIIs produced, the car is innately exclusive. And, if you're looking for a fully sorted, fully pedigreed Austin that's also a blast to drive, it's the 'big Healey' of your dreams!", "BODYWORK/TRIM", "Roughly 40 miles out of a detailed reboot, this impressive Mk III is one of Healy expert Kurt Tanner's fully documented nut-and-bolt rotisserie restorations. Finished in a smooth coat of Golden Beige Metallic, the car features top-notch rehab that was completed to Austin-Healey Club Gold Concours standards, with the ultimate goal being absolute authenticity. At the front of the car, a mirrored bumper hangs new overriders beneath chrome-trimmed headlights, bullet-style parking lamps and a textured grille that's topped by an ornate header emblem. Above that grille, a subtle hood scoop leads the eye to chrome-trimmed glass that's capped in clean black cloth. At the sides of that scoop, classy fender toppers perfectly complement chrome door handles, polished profile inserts and sculpted style lines. At the back of those toppers, correct ''Austin-Healey 3000'' badging rides between chrome trunk trim, simple tail lamps, a small gas cap and a second bumper that features two more overriders. And it all adds up to one lust worthy 3000 that puts most European metal to shame!", "ENGINE", "Mechanically, this Austin exemplifies top-notch detailing through a rare twin-carb engine that was completely rebuilt at the time of the car's ground-up restoration. Tilt the lightweight hood and you'll find 2.9 liters of 29A 6-cylinder that looks good and runs great! Based on British Motor Corporation's stalwart C-Series, Austin's inline mill isn't a grossly overpowered piece. But it's certainly proven its ability to jet this compact roadster out of many tight curves, and cruise comfortably in just about any situation its owners' demanded. At the top of the light green block, vintage Coopers air cleaners sling wind in to two correct SU carburetors. At the base of those carbs, a stamped, factory-correct valve cover caps factory intake and exhaust manifolds. At the base of that cover, an old school points distributor sequences spark through fresh Cobalt plug wires. And the car's tight engine bay is dotted with many show-ready essentials, including a correct Coventry radiator, a color-keyed generator and a requisite red finger guard.", "DRIVETRAIN/SUSPENSION", "Designed to be basic and simple, this micro roadster utilizes a slew of factory-correct parts to create an exceptionally fun driving experience. Behind the engine, a rugged 4-speed serves up an awesome mix of curve-carving prowess and calm highway manners. Stops come courtesy of manual front disc and rear drum brakes. The car's chassis, which rides on a familiar set of coil and leaf springs, has been restored in a subdued mix of beige and black pigment. A factory manifold, replacement pipes and traditional mufflers handle exhaust. At the corners of the floor, correct wire wheels spin 175/80R15 BF Goodrich Touring T/As around fresh knock-offs. And, as far as appearance goes, the bottom of this 'big Healey' is exactly what you'd expect from a lightly used restoration.", "INTERIOR", "Like its exterior, the interior of this 3000 was completely rejuvenated during the car's ground-up restoration. Front and center, small bucket seats sport silver-piped Ambla. In front of those seats, a correct Walnut-veneer dash centers a retro mirror on factory heat, restored Smiths telemetry and a locking glovebox. Beneath that dash, a flowing console frames a petite shifter. Below that console, plush red carpet provides a supple foundation for a polished hand brake. In front of the driver, a classy steering wheel spins a period-correct trafficator. At the sides of the passengers, scuff-free door panels frame bright chrome hardware. And behind the cockpit, a small trunk hauls a fifth wire wheel and fifth Touring tire opposite a Lucas-branded battery.", "OUR SALE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION", "An Austin-Healey driver's Handbook", "Restoration photos", "Vintage European metal has aged with more grace than most, wearing designs that are still capable of turning heads in their basic factory form. And since they're becoming increasingly scarce, British offerings like this pedigreed Austin get snapped up almost as quickly as they hit the market. If you're an enthusiast who likes to put their hardware on the pavement, few classics deliver this blend of fun and exclusivity. And, being fresh out of a Concours-level restoration, this roadster should fare very well at any gathering you choose to attend!"], "Exterior:": "Golden Metallic Beige", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "89571"}},

Some new leather/vinyl on the interior, a little engine work and new paint in the original  Ice Blue Metallic color. Then, one of life's mysteries occurred ... The car, after only being driven a couple of times, was tucked away, to sit for 20+ years. Many have speculated the cause of this often seen malady, no-one knows for sure why it happens but it does and often it is not kind to the auto.

The brakes need to be bled (although after sitting for this long, brake work of some sort would be expected anyway), the bright work and chrome are all pitted, but as evidenced by the numerous photos, they cleaned up very well and do present very shiny and bright. Some of the interior bits are worn and I'm guessing were not replaced as part of the \"restoration\". The leather is a little slack in some spots but does not have any tears  or major creases and folds. She has roughly 87,000 miles on the clock. Runs well, and is super solid.  Oil pressure gauge works and shows about 55 pounds of pressure. Fuel gauge shows full or empty. Lights were working intermittently. There is no rust/rot on her anywhere. As seen in the photos, the before and afters are quite stunning. She went from a tired, dirty classic to a beauty just about ready to get out and be enjoyed. With some in-depth detailing I'm pretty sure you could snag an award with her, just probably not 1st.

When first introduced at the London Motor Show of 1952 the Austin-Healey was an overnight sensation. This creation inspired by Donald Healey and designed by B. Bildy and G. Coker has withstood the test of time and the body lines remain basically the same although the car has undergone numerous mechanical changes through the years. British Motor Corporation ceased to enter it in sports-car races when the six-cylinder engine replaced the old Austin 16-based four but it is now a contender for international rally honors. With a hard-to-beat combination of great structural strength and booming performance the Austin-Healey has been a consistent top finisher in the hands of drivers like Pat Moss and David Seigle-Morris. The sight and sound of Pat Moss howling over an Alpine pass in hairy-looking Healey sans bumpers and loaded with lights is a never-to-be-forgotten thrill. In more than one rally the straight-line performance of the Healey has given it the edge over many more sophisticated more expensive automobiles.  A new centrally located gear lever has replaced the cranked direct-working side lever of previous models but the remote-control linkage is no quicker than the offset mechanism and during warm-up requires much more muscle than the old linkage. Body roll is as absent as ever on the 3000. There are no complications about seeing your line through a turn since you sit in exactly the same vertical position regardless of how many times you may have to alter your direction. This is an inherent quality of the Austin-Healey which probably has served to endear it to more drivers than has any other one of its good qualities. The large-diameter steering wheel provides good leverage for taking sharp turns however and the steering ratio is high enough to enable everyone to drive it enthusiastically.   The Healey will still find an eager audience with the more traditionally minded enthusiast. It is a true sporting machine in the sense that it looks fine sounds fierce and goes fast. If it rides hard and crosses cracks in the road with a loud thump so what? We can remember when unyielding suspension and continual tightening of all the nuts and bolts on the automobile were status symbols to be treasured by any true aficionado. Options include: Wire wheels radial tires vinyl interior seat belts manual top.  To view the car in greater detail including 100+ HD photos and HD video please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com.
