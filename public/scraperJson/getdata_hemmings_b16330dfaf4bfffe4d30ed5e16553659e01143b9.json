From the side you might notice the rake to the chassis and the 17-inch wheels as the first indication.  Or maybe you noticed the cowl induction hood first that is riveted on like the hood scoops on an AC Cobra.  From the front the look is even more intimidating.  From there you will see the body colored aftermarket bumper that reaches for the ground with a center cutout that provides plenty of air flow to keep the powerhouse lurking under the hood cool.  Black stripes start on the scoop that has 331 Stroker in script on the side and runs over the roof to the trunk and down ending in a blacked out rear bumper.  Below that is a GT lower valence with cutouts for the chrome exhaust tips extending out through them.", "Open the door and you will find a nicely trimmed out black interior with some nice upgrades worked into it.  The door panel itself looks good bordered by body color with a slash of chrome piping echoing the body lines of the car.  The seats have been recovered with the Pony interior and that always adds a touch of class to a Mustang.  A deep dish three spoke steering wheel with a Mustang center button sits in front of a stock dash pod that has been upgraded with a full set of Dolphin gauges with wide polished bezels.  The tach and speedo are in the middle with two gauges on each side to keep track of critical engine functions.    An AM/FM/iPod compatible radio pumping the tunes out through Pioneer 6X9s is there for your listening pleasure and there is a white Hurst shifter for the 5-speed manual transmission extending from the floor just begging to be stirred around.", "Under that hood you will find that 331 Stroker motor nestled down in a neat, clean, and nicely detailed out engine bay.  Aluminum is the dominant theme here with just a couple splashes of chrome present.  The polished air filter housing sends fresh air to a Holley 4-barrel carburetor.  Air then flows through an aluminum manifold and Flotek heads.  Finned aluminum valve covers look great and help a bit with oil cooling.  An aluminum radiator keeps thing running cool and there are aluminum pulleys and brackets mounting the accessories. A Flowmaster dual exhaust system leads back to those chrome exhaust tips.  Power is sent back through that 5-speed transmission to 255/45ZR17 tires mounted on Ridler wheels.  Traction bars keep the axle from winding up and puts the power on the ground effectively.  Up front, the rubber meets the road through 215/45ZR17s with a beefy sway bar to keep them flat on the road during spirited driving.", "A driver's car.

It was originally based on the platform of the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a ''1964\u00bd'' by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.
