The Chevrolet Corvette (C3) was a sports car that was produced by Chevrolet for the 1968 through 1982 model years. Engines and chassis components were mostly carried over from the previous generation but the body and interior were new. It set new sales records with 53807 produced for the 1979 model year. 1982 saw the debut of the \"??Cross-Fire Injection\"?\u009d fuel delivery system. This TBI (Throttle Body Fuel Injection) was not the type of fuel injection installed previously in some C1 and C2 Corvettes. It utilized two throttle bodies combined with Chevrolet\"??s computer control system. The engine produced 200 HP and was mated to a new four-speed automatic transmission with torque converters bypass in the top three gears. Compared to the previous Turbo-Hydramatic 3-speed the new 700-R4 transmission had a lower first and second gear for improved low-end acceleration and a fourth gear overdrive that would reduce engine RPM by 30 percent at highway cruising speeds resulting in better fuel economy.To view the car in greater detail including 100+ HD pictures and a HD video please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our Denver showroom.
