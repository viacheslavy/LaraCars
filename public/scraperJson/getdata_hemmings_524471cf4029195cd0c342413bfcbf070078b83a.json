The paint and interior colors remain the same from factory. The exterior is painted in a great looking Flamingo Pink and the interior including the vinyl upholstery is all white. The white vinyl top provides a beautiful look while in use. The paint has aged very well and has plenty of shine left. The brightwork does show a bit of age in some areas a little pitting can be seen here and there. The vinyl interior also shows minor wear in a few areas along with some of the plastic pieces but does present well. All in all considering the age of the restoration this is a fine example of a driver quality 59\"?? Thunderbird Convertible. Under the hood you will find a 352 CID 4BBL V8 engine that is mated to a Cruise-o-Matic 3-spd auto transmission. Both the engine and transmission are believed to be original to the car.

The first generation of the Thunderbird was Ford\"??s answer to Chevrolet\"??s Corvette. The Tbird story started in 1953 on paper and Ford showed the first prototype in early 1954. Even though it was a rapid development Ford did a fantastic job and today the early Thunderbirds are on top of the list of almost every car enthusiast in the world. This particular 1956 Ford Thunderbird is a very nice driver. Lady owned for the past 10 years and she took good care of her \"??Baby Bird\"?\u009d Olivia. For many people the cars from the 50\"??s are considered a piece of art. It is a pleasure to just walk around this turquoise Thunderbird and see the many details and the great craftmanship. After the walk around you want to get in the drivers seat and take off in it. This Tbird is powered by its 292ci V8 engine and shifted by an automatic transmission. You will have a good time driving this one around town. A major plus is that the car comes with both tops the port hole hardtop and a soft top. To put an additional soft top in an early Thunderbird would cost you between $4000 and $5000. Folks this one has it already folded up behind the bench seat. The continental kit and the white wall tires are a perfect fit to the Bird. This is a great buy if you are not looking to spent a fortune on one. This is a great driver that is ready for new adventures. Let it ride.To see 100+ HD pictures and a video of this 1956 Ford Thunderbird please visit www.GatewayClassicCars.com.
