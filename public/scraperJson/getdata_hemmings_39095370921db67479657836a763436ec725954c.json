This 1970 Ford Mustang Mach 1 was purchased new and spent most of its life in California where it was well kept and looks nearly as good as the day it left the showroom floor. The 351 Cleveland sitting under the hood stock was the most powerful small block you could get and put out a whopping 300 horsepower and 385 ft. lbs of torque which was plenty to get up and going in a hurry. The 351 Cleveland with the 4 valve heads were easy to identify with the \"??M\"?\u009d Code in the VIN. The 1970 Ford Mustang fastback is one of the most sought after body styles and has only increased in popularity with age. This Mach 1 has recently had a full tune up done to it including plugs wires rebuilt carburetor hoses belts and a new battery. The engine was then dressed up with a set of tasteful aluminum valve covers. The Mag wheels really set off the look and contrast nicely against the stunning red paint. There are few choices out there that can offer you what the 1970 Mach 1 can. The high power ratings create a driving experience unlike any other and are before the age of any driver assistance features. Every time you walk out into the garage or parking lot and see that car sitting there it will surely bring a smile to your face. The timeless styling continues as you slide into the driver\"??s seat and drop it into gear. As you drive away turning every head it passes you will feel a sense of pride in your newly acquired ride! This vehicle is located in our Denver showroom. You can view this 1970 Ford Mustang Mach 1 in greater detail including HD pictures and an HD video of it running and driving at Gatewayclassiccars.com.

So when it also has a cool story to tell, then that's just the cherry on top.", "We have the original warranty card that tells us this was sold new at Berge Ford.  So over half a century later, you can pick up this classic from a place that is right next door from where the dealership is today! But this is far from just a time capsule.  A thorough restoration was completed only about 4k miles ago.  That's when the bold and modern cobalt blue was laid down with the ghost Pony on the sides.  And before the clearcoat was applied, the white racing stipes when down.  So both the blue and white have an excellent gloss.  The shine is furthered by a solid investment in mirror-like chrome bumpers.  Plus, we know you love all the aggressive touches like the GT fog lights in the grille, and iconic Cragar SS wheels.", "Inside is a great mix of vintage pieces and upgrades.  Two-tone aqua and parchment are classic colors on the seats.  And Mustang people will instantly gravitate to the premium ''pony'' package seen here.  The parchment door panels provide a nice color bridge between the interior aqua and the exterior cobalt that's now utilized inside for an accent color.  The result is a well-coordinated and very distinct total package \u2013 and the new restoration means it all feels quite fresh.  You get the classic Mustang three-spoke sports steering wheel, and beyond that is the ultra wide speedometer.  It has some great period-correct upgrades like the auxiliary gauge trio and provisions for air conditioning.  The original AM radio is even still in place.  But your real music comes from the glovebox where the Kenwood AM/FM/CD/XM stereo w/aux input is hidden.  That way you get the best driving tunes without spoiling the vintage atmosphere.  Also, don't forget to check out the trunk where the custom pony graphic subwoofer box lives.  And speaking of upgrades, the large AutoMeter tach on the steering column is a nice indication of something special under the hood.", "The presentation of the V8 looks both fierce and clean.  The blue wires, air cleaner, and other pieces look great against the exterior paint and glossy black engine bay.  And everyone loves polished components like the valve covers, air topper, intake, and Monte Carlo bar.  This Mustang has been upgraded to a 302 cubic-inch V8.  It inhales deeply through an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority as the long tube headers feed the rumbling dual exhaust.  Out on the road you have great driving features like the three-speed automatic transmission and thick front sway bar.  Plus, the front disc brakes and grip of BF Goodrich T/As make this bold blue classic and easy driver.", "Complete with owner's manual and Berge Ford warranty card, you're looking at something fresh, distinctive, and iconic.

This is a NO RESERVE auction. The Ford Mustang has been one of the most prominent models of the US car manufacturer Ford and it has been an American icon for more than 50 years. This is a car with a usable interior (the seats and bench were reupholstered with original Ford vinyl fabric), the dashboard is in usable condition, it's missing some interior fittings and the carpet. What makes this Mustang so unique is the central console (a luxury option in 1966). The Mustang runs neatly, the brakes and the fuel pump need to be repaired/replaced before it can be driven. The fuel tank was recently replaced.It is, however, a car with work, it needs to be addressed in its entirety both visually as well as technically, see photos.This is a Mustang convertible project with a lot of potential. Especially first generation Mustang convertibles increase significantly in value and are getting harder and harder to find. So grab this opportunity to become the new owner of this American pride!
