This 1967 coupe is a lovely car that's a pleasure to drive and delivers a fun V8 Mustang experience that you'll definitely appreciate once you get behind the wheel.", "The Mustang's success was based primarily on its ability to be almost all things to all people, and coupes like this one were the reason why the less profitable and more expensive Mach 1s and Shelbys could exist. Nicely presented, the body is straight with no major signs of repair through the years. The bright Springtime Yellow finish looks authentic and shows a few signs of use and age but nothing that would stop you from jumping in and going for a ride. There are a few touch ups and we do like the recently-installed black stripes along the rocker panels that coordinate well with the matching black vinyl top.  Details are correct throughout, including the grille, emblems, and trademark Mustang gas filler cap out back. Chrome on the bumpers is very nice, and the stainless around the windows has a wonderful patina that looks totally authentic. The aforementioned black vinyl top makes this yellow car look masculine and shows none of the usual signs of trouble underneath. There's no question that this is a very handsome car.", "From behind the wheel, you'll be hard-pressed to determine what's living under the hood, since all Mustangs had beautiful bucket seat interiors. However, this one carries a set of modern chairs that fit so well most folks won't even notice that they're not original equipment. They work well with the new carpet and upscale door panels with woodgrained appliques. The fat steering wheel looks sporty with its three spokes, which also give a great view of the stylish Mustang dashboard full of functional original gauges. Although this car probably came with an AM radio originally, it now carries a Sony AM/FM/CD unit that fits in the original location, so nothing was cut or modified in the process. A slender chrome handle with a wooden knob controls the automatic transmission, and the lack of a console seems to be perfectly appropriate in this pony. You also get factory A/C, which wasn't all that common back in 1967 but is quite welcome here. The trunk is neatly finished with correct mats and a full-sized spare tire with matching cover.", "The engine is a C-code 289 cubic inch V8, which was a popular choice and offered a great balance of power and good manners. Although there's no way to be sure, we're fairly certain this is the car's original engine and it looks quite correct in the Mustang's engine bay with Ford Blue paint, a chrome air cleaner with reproduction decals, and original ignition equipment. It's almost completely stock, which means a thrifty 2-barrel carburetor and standard exhaust manifolds, so it's easy to live with on a daily basis. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic that snaps off quick shifts and the door tag says there are 2.80 gears out back, so it's a great highway cruiser. Brakes are drums all around, the there's a newer dual exhaust system, and the wheels are cool 14-inch Magnums wearing 215/70/14 performance radials.", "All the things that make early Mustangs great are here, including torquey V8 power. The styling is still a hit, and most folks don't even care what's under the hood when they see a pretty Mustang coupe like this.

In the sixteen years since the movie debuted, no other Mustang is as recognizable as \"Eleanor\" and no movie car has been imitated more. Built by Cinema Vehicle Services in Hollywood, California, a total of eleven 1967 and 1968 Ford Mustang Fastbacks were built for the film, and although some were wrecked, a number survived filming and have since been sold. This 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback is Eleanor 3 built for the film, and has just completed a 0-mile, ground up restoration at Cinema Vehicle Services, the people who know her best. Each Eleanor was built to perform a different function in the movie and so received slightly different builds, although aesthetically they were built to look identical. This Eleanor is powered by a stroked 347ci small block Ford built by Blueprint Engines and features aluminum heads, roller cam, Edelbrock Performer intake manifold, Holley Ultra Double Pumper carburetor, MSD Pro billet distributor, MSD Blaster coil, MSD Street Fire CDI ignition, ceramic coated headers, March serpentine accessory drive system, Canton 6-quart deep sump oil pan and pickup, and a Nitrous Oxide Systems Powershot nitrous system. Backed up by a Tremec 5-speed manual transmission, the drivetrain has also been built up using a Ram flywheel and clutch, QuickTime bellhousing, Wenco custom-built driveshaft, and a hydraulic clutch system by Modern Driveline. Out back, the rear end was built by Ron's Rear Ends in Los Angeles, California, and features a Currie rear differential housing and axles, Energy Suspension bushings, and a Posi rear diff with 3.70 gears. To keep everything under control, the Mustang features front and rear power disc brakes with a Wilwood master cylinder with Wilwood calipers, oversized cross-drilled rotors, and front lightweight hubs, while the front end features a Total Control Products power rack and pinion steering system with Total Control front suspension and coil over shocks along with a Monte Carlo brace, tower export brace, and truss brace. Throughout the car, custom stainless brake and fuel lines have been fabricated along with a custom stainless exhaust with dual Magnaflow mufflers. Inside the cabin, the interior remains mostly stock, with the exception of Total Control Products clutch and brake pedals, an Autometer Sport-Comp Monster tachometer with shift light, and a Hurst shifter with the infamous \"Go Baby Go\" shift knob along with the nitrous system arming switch while the trunk houses the nitrous bottle along with a Fuel Safe fuel cell with bladder for safety. Now, although the build itself is pretty impressive, the most alluring feature of this Mustang is that it is an authentic Eleanor. Sure, clones can be built or bought, but there are clones and then there is the real deal and this car is the real deal, nothing else comes close. Sitting behind the wheel of a car that created an entirely new genre of car builds when it was designed, this car is a piece of movie and automobile history. Like a Bullitt Mustang, or a Mad Max Interceptor, imitations come close, but nothing compares to the real thing and knowing that makes this car beyond special."]}},

Gateway Classic Cars of St. Louis is proud to offer a great little 1967 Ford Mustang.  Ford rewrote the automotive experience when they rolled out the Mustang in 1964.  The most innovative thing about the model was the lengthy options list.  A Mustang could be built to spec however the buyer desired.  There were multiple body styles multiple engines available several transmissions colors interior trim levels and all sorts of equipment options available.  Because of this long list almost no two Mustangs were just alike.  This makes it a fun model to collect because although they made a lot of them each one has its own personality.  This particular example is a 1967 model the first year of a styling change since new.  The 67 model retained the same overall shape but received slightly more muscular hips and a sportier front end.  The interior received a new dash design as well as many subtle trim changes.  This one is finished in bright white and sits on classic styled steel wheels wrapped in raised white letter tires.  The body is straight and solid and would make any Mustang enthusiast proud.  Open the door and inside youll find a unique interior combination which combines a textured brown and tan two tone upholstery.  The seats door panels and dash are all in wonderful shape as well as the wood rimmed steering wheel.  This Mustang runs and drives incredibly well.  The 289 CID V8 makes good power and has a nice exhaust note.  The V8 is backed by a 3 speed automatic which shifts smoothly.  The car benefits from power steering and power brakes to make the driving experience more comfortable.  Another nice option is Air Conditioning.  Overall this is a clean example of one of Americas most popular collector cars.  This would make a great entry level classic as well as fitting in well with any avid collectors collection.

To say this car is a sweet cruiser is an understatement. With all of the suspension components up front replaced in 2001 this Pony feels tight through the turns and tracks straight all day long. In 2010 the front suspension was lowered 2 inches with new springs to give the car a better stance and the rear leafs were replaced at the same time. In other words the suspension is all new and it drives like it! Add in the smooth shifting C4 3 speed automatic transmission light power steering and perfect rumble from the 289 CID V8 and you really will love to drive this drop- top. The 2? drop really makes the 15 American Racing Torque Thrust II??s fill the wheel well perfectly. When you do as much cruising as you will behind this wheel of course you will have to stop from time to time. SSBC Power disc brakes that were added in 2012 make coming to a halt a breeze. When the suspension was done in 2001 the car was also media blasted and repainted the factory Springtime Yellow. The Shelby hood and chin spoiler were added at this time to ensure that they would have a perfect paint match. The power top is the original top and as such shows some age but is in overall good condition regardless. Not like it will matter much as you will want to have it down all of the time anyways! Other options on this 67 Mustang convertible include an AM radio power disc brakes power steering seat belts aluminum alloy wheels and raised white letter tires.

Both the engine and transmission were rebuilt and have approximately 2000 miles on them. This 67 Shelby GT500 was refinished its original Lime Gold paint when restored. It is not known if the white LeMans stripes were installed at the Dealer or if the original owner had them added but they were there before the car was restored so they are there now. It was officially produced on 05/25/1967 and delivered to Jim Aikey Ford in Des Plaines IL. The first owner bought the car and drove it for 3 years he put it in storage in 1970 and sold it in 1977. The second owner bought it stuffed it away in storage and it sat in storage until 2003. It was then sold in 2004 and finally in 2009 an extensive and comprehensive concours-style restoration was completed. The restoration emphasized functionality drive-ability and reliability. This Shelby was intended to be driven and enjoyed not just a trailer queen. All original Shelby fiberglass was utilized as well as the original Magstar Kelsey Hayes wheels very few reproduction components were needed to restore this Shelby back to life. The windshield is original (it still bears the 1970 Chicago city tax stickers) as is the black vinyl interior. The interior (seats dash gauges etc.) is in excellent condition especially considering its age. These items help support the fact of the incredibly low mileage on the car. This is your chance to own a truly historic vehicle with very low miles.

The 67 Mustang Coupe for sale is a looker with a color that makes this pony stand out from the rest. With a Burnt Orange paint scheme with a fine metallic that shimmers in the sunlight this Ford simply pops. The front grill and blackout spoiler add a dash of panache that is a tribute to the late and great 60s. Complimented by a set of staggered polished aluminum/alloy wheels that are wrapped in radial tires this car has a stance that screams muscle car. If the look doesnt give it away the sound surely will. The ground pounds thanks to a dumped dual exhaust system that lets you know this Mustang isnt your average grocery geter. A 302 cubic inch Ford V8 engine is tucked between the fender wells and makes this Ford one peppy pony! Backed by an automatic transmission this is one easy driving pony car. If a vintage muscle car is what youre after then look no further. If the sound and sight of Blue oval muscle doesnt get you the feel of the wheel will. The interior is a real blast from the past with Black vinyl sport buckets up front and a roomy bench out back. Throw in some safety with a set of seat belts and youre more than ready to head on down to the local show.
