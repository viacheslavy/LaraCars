\u201cA\u201d charted a new direction for MG. The cars were lower with sleek lines, more roomy interior, low seating position and more powerful. Most importantly was the departure of the body-on-frame design for a uni-body construction. The car was stiffer, much more ridged, and demonstrated vastly improved handling capabilities. The A transcended MG to the sports car world and developed a rich racing history. To this day, the MGA is considered the best overall MG produced.", " ", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this rare 1957 MG MGA 1500 Coupe for consideration. The MGA offered here today is finished in a White exterior paint that is in great condition and presents very well after receiving a detail. Paired with the exterior is a sharp Red leather interior that is in immaculate condition throughout. According to the owner and the documents present, most of the restoration work was done in early 2000. The engine was gone through in 2005, at that time it was fully rebuilt and holds about 12,000 miles on it currently \u2013 same goes with the clutch which was also replaced at that time. This vehicle has been gone through with no expense spared from top to bottom and it sure does show mechanically and cosmetically.

The SU carbs were completely rebuilt and the door panels and body trim have been replaced with brick red.  The car was restored about a year ago and is ready for the next owner to enjoy what only British road cars can do in abundance.  Like its ancestors it's a whole lot of fun to drive. The steering as always is very quick over a large lock, and Detroit-conditioned drivers may look somewhat palsied at the wheel until they sharpen their responses. Once they do, though, the alert steering naturally makes for excellent control of the machine. This steering is light, has a fairly strong self-centering action and is devoid of play. Minor road shocks are not felt through the steering wheel.  Another of the organs of the machine that retains the old MG's character is the gearbox. The remote shift lever is ideally at hand; stubby and short in travel, and the synchromesh is infallible. The hydraulically-assisted clutch is light, strong and sure and upshifts can be made with lightning speed.  The \"A's\" ride is still another instance of blood telling. It's smooth on smooth pavement.  The car cruises free and easy and still retains pretty good acceleration. It has a solid, substantial, all-of-a-piece feel that's largely due to the \"A's\" new frame.  Options include: Convertible Top, wire wheels, vinyl interior, seat belts, telescopic wheel, white walls.

Painted in 2010 - Originally was green, vehicle had a color change from Green to bright red.   All new leather interior including seats, door panels and dash cover.   Engine rebuilt in 2011 by Melvin MGB in Greensboro, NC.   New Robbins top.   Great driver.  History: This MGB arrived in the current owner's possession after a close friend past away in 2005. That friend had purchased it for his son back in the mid 80's and was believed to be the second owner. When the second owner passed away the current owner purchased it off the family and commissioned the restoration and color change to red.     Body: The body is in great shape, the paint is barely 6 years old and shows extremely well. The blacked out grille was new for '70 and you would never know that this car started life as a Green MG B. The convertible top is a brand new Robbins top.  The Robbins top uses a Stayfast fabric. Stayfast fabric uses 100% acrylic surface cloth, laminated to a pre-shrunk cotton backing cloth. Stayfast canvas resists fading and shrinking better than vinyl and does not stiffen up at lower temperatures.?    The paintwork was very meticulous. If you look under the hood, you'll see how the hood has been insulated so the heat would not crack or warp the paint.  At the corners, you'll see real knockoff wire wheels and a spare knockoff wire wheel in the trunk.     ENGINE: 1798cc 4-cylinder that was completely overhauled in 2011. The engine is stamped 18G-RWE-H31705. Meaning it was a high compression 1798cc engine with a center gear change and overdrive. The engine was built by Melvin MGB in Greensboro. We are not for certain if this is the original motor or not, they didn't stamp these with the numbers matching partial VIN. However, the coding suggests that it is at least period correct.     INTERIOR: The interior is all pretty much brand new. New leather seat covers, door panels, and a custom leather dash replace the old vinyl dashes that crack under the heat. The new leather gives it a much better overall look and brings it in to the 20th centrury. All the gauges appear to be working, minus the horn that we could not get to work."], "seller_name": "DC CLASSIC CARS EAST", "title": "1970 MG MGB ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "19995", "kilometers": 95630.915, "total_pages": 5, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29676897", "brand": "MG", "reference_id": "29676897", "year": "1970", "model": "MGB", "specs": {"Engine": "1798cc 4-Cylinder", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "59,435 miles", "Transmission": "4-Speed Manual", "Stock #": "1933", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Red"}}
