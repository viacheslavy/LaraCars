"91543", "description": ["This 1953 Chevrolet 3100 pickup has all the right looks for a cool vintage truck.  The Advanced Design style has matured into old-school tough Americana attitude, and oh yes, this one has the ultra-desirable five-window style.  Now you have to decide, will it be the coolest workhorse cruiser around, or a candidate for a V8 upgrade in the hot vintage truck market?  With this exceptional condition and affordable price, anything is possible.  ", "  This Chevy provides a real lesson in honesty.  Over the years, plenty of classic trucks have been filled with more features than the factory ever intended.  Instead, this one has just gone through good maintenance as it passes into its seventh decade.  The body is nice and straight, and the wood in the truck bed has been replaced to erase decades of any tough loads or rot.  The glass is nice and clean, including the optional rear quarter glass that makes this the desirable five-window pickup.  The Polo Green is the result of at least one modern respray.  It's a timeless color now featuring a clearcoat shine that will make you want to show your Chevy off this weekend.  Plus, there are hints of well-earned sophistication with the tall chrome five-slat grille, and the shine of the two-piece wheels.  It's the kind of appearance that comes with real credibility.  You could even buy this pickup today and put your company's name on the side.  It will instantly make your business look like it has decades of sturdy history, even if you just opened your door yesterday.  ", "  The interior is still working-class all the way, and clean, but that's all part of the vintage truck appeal.  The two-tone green and gold is always attractive, which is all part of the thoughtful care that has gone into this pickup over the years.  Trucks of this era had very few features, so to see the heater and radio (and have them still working) makes this a positively loaded machine! But more than just distinguished, you really like this truck because from the moment you slip behind the three-spoke steering wheel you can feel the grooves of the generations of workmen who have relied on this rolling history.  ", "  Under the hood this truck continues its theme of honest showmanship.  Chevrolet's Blue Flame six looks terrific with the big blue block and silver head cover radiating from within the dark engine bay.  Plus, this is believed to be the larger optional 235 cubic-inch motor.  That means this is the kind of classic tough truck engine that has some serious workman torque, is smooth as a sewing machine, and has a fantastic old exhaust note that chugs along like a freight train. For that added touch of period-correct fun, the motor is mated to a three-speed column shift manual transmission.   ", "  Five-window Chevys are red hot, so it's amazing such a sharp, well-sorted, and distinguished pickup is also quite affordable.  That's you know it will be gone soon.

Small block V8, automatic transmission, the usual stuff, right? Nope! This one carries a modern-tech Nissan 2.7 liter turbo diesel that not only transforms the way this cool chopped pickup drives, but also makes it the ideal choice for the hobby of tomorrow.  ", "  Before we get to the tech under the hood, check out the handsome burgundy paint job, which makes this humble pickup look upscale, not beat up. The top has obviously been chopped a few inches, but that does nothing to erase the handsome good looks of the all-new 1955 Chevy truck, which had a lot of styling that matched that of the cars sitting alongside it in the showroom. A few selective piece of trim have been shaved, including the hood ornament, others have been painted to match the bodywork, and some have been replaced, such as the door handles which are from a late-model. Altogether, though, it has an awesome look that's timeless and appealing, so it'll look this good decades from now. There's a nice shine to the two-stage urethane, and in the sunlight the metallic in the finish really makes the curves of the 3100 really glow. There's not a lot of chrome left, but the grille insert looks great, the trim around the side windows has been expertly modified to work with the chopped top, and the original 3100 emblems on the sides of the front fender look great. And, of course, the bed is completely restored with new planks and stainless rub strips.  ", "  Inside it should feel familiar: bench seat, V-shaped instrument panel, and a bright, airy cabin. The gray vinyl upholstery looks and feels more modern than the original stuff and looks great with the matching door panels with their built-in map pockets. Power windows were added, there's a late-model Chevrolet steering wheel, and a tachometer mounted on the A-pillar, but it's not too far removed from 1955. The factory gauges appear to be mostly original and in good order, while the long shifter is connected to a 5-speed manual gearbox that has nice throws and crisp clutch action. Seat belts, carpets, and some sound deadening materials behind the scenes make this a very comfortable cabin for long trips.   ", "  And long trips are effortless thanks to the Nissan 2.7-liter turbo diesel living under the hood. A very clean transplant, it's the ideal truck engine and really attracts attention at shows. Nobody expects to see it and everyone will have about a hundred questions for you when you open the hood. With huge low-end torque, it makes the 3100 feel downright quick around town and thanks to a tall 5th gear in the transmission, highway cruising is effortless at supra-legal speeds, all while pulling down insane fuel economy. The fuel injected engine starts quickly with the usual diesel clatter, but that's part of the fun, because that big rig sound gets more attention than a garden-variety V8. Diesels run nice and cool but there's still a giant radiator and electric fan"], "title": "1955 Chevrolet 3100 ", "total_results": "196 .

The good news is that you can own this beautifully built 1953 Chevy 3100, not for $35,000, but quite a bit less.  ", "  OK, we'll admit it: EVERYTHING looks good in black paint, particularly vintage vehicles with lots of curves. Accentuated with charcoal gray details, it really lets all those great '40s shapes stand out without making it look excessively modern. With straight bodywork that's uncommon on old trucks, it gets a ton of attention on the street and a lot of folks fall in love at first sight. Sure, it's been driven over the past few years, but who could resist? Today it's a great-looking example of a show-and-go pickup that's fully sorted and nicely turned out. The beautiful wood bed gives it an upscale appeal that will make you think twice about returning it to service duty and it includes a set of matching wood stake sides that look great. Chrome bumpers with oversized bumper guards, nice-looking grille inserts, and custom step plates add a little brightwork. It's not perfect, but the look is right.  ", "  Inside it's still basic and simple, but carries enough details to give it a purposeful and upscale look. The bench seat now wears black upholstery with white piping and pleated for a period look. We'll admit the chain-style steering wheel isn't for everyone, but it does work with the lowrider theme going on throughout the truck. The original gauges remain in the dash and a set of auxiliary dials are fitted underneath in the usual fashion. This is also one of the rare vintage pickups that seem to have been equipped with a radio when it was new, although it's now a digital AM/FM unit. There's a tilt steering column that makes it a lot easier to get comfortable and the rear window slats are not only a cool period accessory, but they help keep the interior cool on sunny days. And if this were my truck, I'd spend an hour on a Saturday afternoon tidying up the wiring under the dash; not a big deal, but style matters.  ", "  The engine is a 350 cubic inch Chevy V8, which is a big step up over the original Stovebolt Six that lived there in 1953.With an Edelbrock intake manifold, a 4-barrel carburetor, and a bright chrome air cleaner, it has a dressed-up look that doesn't upset its work-ready demeanor. Power steering and power disc brakes were added during the build, both of which came with the GM subframe that was grafted on. A TH350 3-speed automatic transmission is rugged and reliable, giving this truck the ability to still haul some gear, and the 10-bolt rear hangs on stock leaf springs with lowering blocks that help with that slammed stance. A dual exhaust system sounds racy and the frame is in good overall shape, so no worries about a compromised foundation. The suspension is obviously lowered quite a bit, and it has a traditional lowrider look, especially wit"], "title": "1953 Chevrolet 3100 ", "total_results": "196 .
