Oh yeah, this is an exceptionally cool and useful custom that you can pick up for far less than you could build it yourself.", "We can't get enough of Wimbledon White.  While it was a standard factory color, it just seemed to make its way to many of Ford's best performance machines.  So it only seems fitting to be the factory-correct color for this enhanced Ranchero.  It was repainted in 2009, and the way it still shines today tells you this was a solid investment in quality.  And while we'll dive into the performance upgrades in a just a moment, it's worth noting that this car really looks like it was ready for speed from day one.  The upgraded face of the 2nd generation Falcon looks great on the Ranchero with a wider front end and a larger bumper with more chrome.  The profile has a great style line in the sheetmetal that looks like it's pointing the car forward, and this is furthered by the full-length trim.  Even the taillights look like afterburners.  Plus, the addition of American Racing Torq Thrust wheels adds to this sporty personality.  But even with all this, don't forget about the Ranchero's practical side.  With a tough rubber floor mat in the bed and locking storage box, this classic can still have pickup truck usefulness.", "You're going to love showing off the interior.  While red was the original color, this has been upgraded with the full Ron Mangus premium touch.  That means a split bench covered in leather, cup holder center console, and an overall uniform appearance.  And if you look at the doors, you'll see they kept the original paint on the tops, just to remind you this is a classic with a history.  This Ranchero has been updated with the right features like a Blaupunkt AM/FM/CD stereo and R134a air conditioning.  But as you slip behind the Lecarra steering wheel, grab the gearshift, and spot the large Summit tach, you soon realize that this comfortable Ranchero is also a performance machine.", "The engine bay looks fantastic.  The shine of the air topper, ribbed valve covers, and upgraded pulleys signify both style and strength.  The Ranchero's relationship to the Falcon/Mustang makes it great for V8 upgrades.  So while the factory topped out at 289 cubic-inches, this one has been given a serious upgrade in power with a 347ci crate motor from the quality builders at Speedomotive.  The mighty motor inhales deeply through an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority as tri-y headers add even more horsepower as they also contribute to the rumbling dual exhaust.  You've got complete control over this muscular V8 and its thunderous soundtrack thanks to the five-speed manual transmission.  Plus, you have a thick front sway bar, front disc brakes, and modern Goodyear tires for grip.", "Complete with owner's manual and a large maintenance record file, this one is ready for everything from the car show to the morning commute.  So if you've been looking for a great total package classic, don't let this one slip away.

The car comes equipped with both short and full Tonneau covers, wire wheel wrench, hammer and jack plus an original MGC Glove Box Manual. If you are looking for an MG that is a little different you should see and drive this great car while you can.
