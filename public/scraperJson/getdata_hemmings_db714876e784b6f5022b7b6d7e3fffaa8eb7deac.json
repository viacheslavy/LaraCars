This car was recently purchased from a Jaguar enthusiast from the East Coast who purchased this car from the believed original owner's widow. There is a maintenance sticker still attached to the driver's B-post showing it was serviced on 5-4-73 at 41,550 miles in Winter Park, Florida. The car still retains 3 of it's original Dunlop tires: the two rear tires and the spare tire. They are all matching and correct as factory delivered tires, testament to the car's low original mileage. This car is finished in the fantastic factory color scheme of Opalescent Golden Sand with a Beige interior, a light and elegant color combination for a closed car. The car appears to have had one simple respray at one point, in the same color.", "The body on this car is overall excellent, is just about completely rustfree, but has suffered some minor dings and dents from being stored over the years. Panel fit is very good. There is some very minor rust-through on the bottom of both doors. The sills are fantastic. There is only some very minor bubbling down very low on both sides(see picture). The dipped portion of the floors are original and look perfectly fine. Boot floor looks perfect. Overall, a superb body with very little in the way of bodywork or sheetmetal repairs.", "The car's interior trim is very original. The carpets have been removed which were falling apart/deteriorated. The car would require a retrim but most all of the items are original to start with. The dashboard facia/gauges/ switches all look excellent. At some point the car's glass was damaged and removed, but is available today both as new and used items.", "The car's matching numbers engine has been investigated by the previous owner and no.6 piston is believed to be currently stuck, but is still being soaked with penetrant oil. The oil pan has been removed. The engine compartment is extremely original with lots of original hoses, hose clamps, Lucas battery helmet ends, etc. which would facilitate an easier restoration. All items have been bagged and labelled that were removed from the car. Bonnet fit is very nice with no evidence of accident damage to the nose. Car also includes the original lifting jack with the bag, and pair of original Lucas headlamps.", "Overall, a final year Series One 4.2 Liter E-type Coupe in a stunning original color scheme, with very low miles and a matching numbers engine. This car would be a candidate for a perfect high-end Concours restoration. Because of it's solid and straight body and the car's originality, alternatively it could be carefully improved and made into a great road car/driver with some mechanical/cosmetic restoration.  We believe that this car is the finest original, un-restored, \"no stories\" car currently available on the market for restoration.", "Please look at all pictures and call or email with any questions.", "The description above is general in nature and not to be solely relied upon by buyer.
