After all, just the way the vintage cab is seamlessly integrated with the modern bed tells you someone spent a ton of time and money getting this build right.  The same goes for the way the familiar newer Silverado front end is blended with the iconic alligator hood.

Tan tweed on the seats offers plenty of comfort, and they are part of a larger coordinated package with the doors, carpeting, and paneling.  Plus the exterior Raspberry Metallic returns on the dash for a great total uniform package.  More than just look great, this one gives you all the right features, including cold R134a air conditioning and a full set of Dolphin gauges.  And because this is the kind of cool custom that will make you want to roll all the windows down, it not only has power side windows, but the back window powers down, too!", "Even the hood on this build is designed to attract attention.  It power tilts forward the entire front end so that it gives you (and everyone else) a clear view of the upgraded powerhouse.  The fuel-injected LT1 motor snugly fits into the custom frame.  And this is not only the C4 Corvette's V8, but also you'll notice the A-arms should look familiar, too.  And if that gets your enthusiast heart pumping, then you'll really fall in love/lust with the undercarriage photos.  That reveals the C4's full independent suspension that was expertly integrated onto this truck.  Plus, it comes with a four-speed automatic transmission w/overdrive, power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, and the grip of modern performance tires.", "So whether you're out to win awards or want the perfect pickup for the Power Tour, this custom Chevy checks all the right boxes.

The result was record-breaking sales to a public hungry for new sheetmetal, and today trucks like this 1948 Chevrolet 3100 remain highly-sought collector's items that work equally well with a few modifications.", "The gray paint makes this truck seem low-key, but it's going to get a lot of attention nonetheless so you had better make sure it's right. With so many of these being nothing more than working-class tools, it's none too easy to find a clean one to restore, and to get one to this level takes a special level of commitment. Someone invested time and money in equally large portions to bring this one to its current spectacular condition, and it fits together better than any truck did in 1948. The five-window cab is the most desirable of the bunch, with cool quarter windows that not only improve visibility, but add a cool design element with the curved glass. Fit and finish are done to professional standards, so you can show it proudly at the local cruise night, where you'll undoubtedly hear stories about the ''one that got away.'' From the outside, it'll take a sharp eye to spot any modifications, and lots of glittering chrome that really dresses up the old pickup. The bed is beautifully finished oak with painted rub strips, and color-matched spray-on bedliner material protects the sides (as if you'll ever use it as a truck!).", "The comfortable yet basic interior has been nicely restored but not excessively modified, adding function without losing all that's great about these trucks. The original bench seat is wrapped in comfortable gray vinyl and the exposed tubular frame gives it a function-over-form look that we love. The dashboard includes factory gauges that work with the warmed-over 350 cubic inch V8 under the hood, although they don't seem to be totally accurate. There's a modern AM/FM radio in the dash, right where the original would have lived, so no cutting or modifying was required there. Even the original steering wheel was retained to preserve that old truck flavor. You can use this one every day and not get tired, which is surely the sign of quality workmanship.", "The engine is a 350 cubic inch V8 with a trick Tri-Power setup, because this truck was built for the road. That's a vintage Offenhauser intake with three 2-barrel carburetors on top, all set up to work like the factory intended. Chevy Orange paint stands out against the satin black engine bay, and those trick valve covers are designed to look vintage, giving this Chevy the look of, say, a vintage J-2 Olds. The transmission is a TH350 3-speed automatic feeding the original rear end, so it doesn't lose its personality while gaining considerably more performance. Up front you get rack-and-pinion steering for the live axle, as well as a set of disc brakes for safety. You'll also get a lot of attention from the rumbling Flowmaster dual exhaust system that features a pair of chrome tips that peek out from under the rear bumper. It sits just right on a slightly lowered suspension, and with classic 15-inch steel wheels with baby moon hubcaps and trim rings, plus fat 235/70/15 rubber, it has a bit of a hot rod look.", "Nice trucks like this don't come along every day, and good luck finding a clean one if you're intent on building your own.

This 1946 Chevrolet 3100 pickup truck is a perfect example. At first glance, it's a nicely restored old pickup, but under the hood there's a V8 engine, an automatic overdrive transmission, and all the performance and comfort of a newer machine.", "Bright red paint is always a wonderful choice for an old pickup. We can all envision a truck just like this, which years ago was working in a field with a denim-clad farmer tossing hay bales into the bed. Today it has been restored to better than new condition. A lot of these were worked to death, but this one seems very solid and clean, so it was probably not a farm mule and survived its working years completely intact. '40s pickups have become collector's items in their own right, combining timeless good looks with great drivability, and this one seems to have distilled the essence of that idea into sharper focus. Most of the chrome trim has been retained and looks great, especially with that black trim running along the sides of the hood and cab. The bed is beautifully finished with a varnished wood floor that has a red stain that's pretty darned close to the color of the bodywork, and it looks awesome!", "Inside, the basics are a little less basic than they were in 1946. Although the goal was to make this a truck capable of cruising like a modern vehicle, the builder didn't want to lose the flavor of a vintage machine. So there's a bench seat, still upholstered in simple black vinyl, and the original metal dash has been restored, not modified. However, inside the gauge panel you'll find the original speedometer flanked by modern gauges, which is a neat touch. The big three-spoke steering wheel is original equipment, too, now vanished with a black leather wrap to give it a more luxurious feel, and there are red accents throughout the interior to tie it all together neatly. Carpets replace the original rubber mats and the original under-dash heater remains, a nice nod to the past. There's also an AM/FM radio hidden out of sight and a custom handle on the shifter so it looks like the original 3-speed manual but actually manages a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission.", "The original six-cylinder engine and stump-pulling gears are long gone, replaced by a rebuilt 283 cubic inch V8. However, the goal wasn't tire-shredding horsepower, but rather comfortable cruising without disturbing the character of the original vehicle. In that regard, it is extremely successful. The engine runs without a fuss, inhaling through a 4-barrel carburetor up top and exhaling through a great-sounding dual exhaust system. There's plenty of shiny stuff on the engine, including a stainless firewall, but you can tell that it was built to cruise first and foremost. Up front, the suspension is stock, which means a rigid axle, but it has been upgraded with front disc brakes. A 1963 Nova donated its rear end and it carries a more street-friendly set of gears so this pickup can cruise all day at highway speeds. Chrome Cragar wheels wearing 235/60/15 blackwall radials give it a vintage hot rod look.", "So if you're attracted to an original truck but would like to have one with a wider operating range and the comforts of a modern machine, here you go.
