The Fabulous 50's are in full affect.  Our cars are huge, and it seems like something new and cool is coming out every time you turn around.  Elvis was at the top of the charts with All Shook Up, and you could even see him at your local Drive In (for all the much younger generation......google what those were) in Jailhouse Rock.  Things were rockn and rolln and people were having the time of their lives, and showing off their rides.      Just Toys Classic Cars is proud to present this amazing machine.  Before you is a 1 owner 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air.  That's right, a 1 owner survivor.  These are getting harder and harder to find.  The fit on this car is original from 1957 as it has never been restored.  The finish is what it is.  As you will see in some of the pics, there are some nicks and chips here and there, but over all, this paint presents very very well for being 59 years old.  As we always say here at JTCC we are known for our quality and our brutal honesty.  We show you what it is and let you judge for yourself.  We don't pull any punches.  That being said, this is very much a car that needs to be in your collection today.  Restore it, maybe....personally, we would leave it the way that it is, because as they say, they are only original once.    The interior of this time capsule is beautiful as well.  You will find one wear mark on the drivers side down by the bottom cushion and that is it.  Again, for 59 years old, this whole car presents itself very well.  The miles that you see on the odometer are original to the car.  Again, it has never been restored.    Under the hood of this beauty sits the original 283 that it was born with.  Some very cool features that this car was ordered with were power steering, power brakes, and even back up lights.  Yes, those were an option that you could pay for back in the day, everything was an option.  The 283 is mated to a powerglide transmission.  This allowed you to cruise in style with power steering, power brakes, and automatic.  Put it in drive, throw your arm around your sweetie, and go cruisn down the boulevard.    So, get this beautiful car, and go back to a simpler time, and remember the good old days.  We offer classic car financing for those that are wanting to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms with as little as 10% down, and you can pay it off without any prepayment penalties.  We look forward to speaking with you soon, and we look forward to making you the newest member of the Just Toys Classic Cars family. DISCLAIMER:    Before you buy any vehicle, sight unseen,  it is very important to ask as many questions as possible to make sure you are getting what you expect.  The majority of the customers that buy vehicles from us are very happy with their purchases.  We recommend that you should inspect cars in person before or have a professional appraisal company of your choice evaluate this vehicle and provide documentation to you at your expens"], "title": "1957 Chevrolet Bel Air ", "total_results": "617", "price": "39995", "kilometers": 116047.516, "total_pages": 27, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27246852", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "27246852", "year": "1957", "model": "Bel", "specs": {"Engine": "283", "Mileage": "72,124 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Red/Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

With timeless looks and the ability to become just about anything you can imagine, there are few better choices for your next car than this lovely 1957 Bel Air 2-door post coupe.   ", "  The color is called really the only one that always looks great on a '57 Chevy: Matador Red. Thanks to a comprehensive restoration several years ago, it was given a full body makeover that included smoothing every parking lot ding it ever acquired, straightening every panel, and making sure that the two-stage urethane paint had a mile-deep shine. A close examination will reveal the usual signs of use and age, but that only proves that the car is working as intended and from five feet away it still looks fantastic. The high-visibility finish suits the '57 just fine, because you don't buy a 1957 Chevy of any kind if you want to keep a low profile. And you already know that chrome isn't cheap and the '57 is literally covered in the stuff, so you're in luck here because it's all in good shape. The side trim could be polished to a chrome-like shine and the emblems could be upgraded, but there aren't many complaints here!  ", "  The interior is as subtle as the exterior is flashy. With factory-looking cloth and vinyl upholstery on the original bench seats, they didn't stray too far from the original recipe, giving it that familiar funky look that '57s have. Black carpets prevent red overload, but it does have red floor mats to add a little brightness. Factory gauges are joined by a trio of aftermarket dials underneath, so the original loo prevails but you get a lot more information about the engine's condition. And yes, that's a Hurst 4-speed poking out of the floor. A modern AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit slots neatly into the dash for a little entertainment while you're cruising, but the dash keeps its flashy 1950s look. The trunk is tidy, too, with a correct rubber and a custom cover for the spare tire.  ", "  Small block Chevy power is a given in a '57 like this, and it's obvious that with 327 cubic inches on tap, not only was it built to drive, but that someone intended for this one to run as great as it looks. The usual stuff like a 4-barrel carb and polished Edelbrock intake manifold helps it build power and like all small block Chevys, it loves to rev and feels like it could pull forever. Other upgrades include front disc brakes with a new dual reservoir master cylinder and power brake booster, an alternator, and an Optima battery. The engine bay is tidy and the chassis shows off what you get when you start with a car from down south: a little surface scale but no critical rust issues. A new Flowmaster exhaust system sounds great and there's a fresh gas tank hanging out back to improve reliability. Cool REV aluminum wheels look like vintage Torque Thrusts and wear modern 225/40/18 front and 245/40/20 rear performance radial"], "title": "1957 Chevrolet Bel Air ", "total_results": "617", "price": "39995", "kilometers": 134716.743, "total_pages": 27, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29969483", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "29969483", "year": "1957", "model": "Bel", "specs": {"Engine": "327 CI", "Mileage": "83,727 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "4 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Red & Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

The paint that was laid down was done very well and has been maintained to a high standard! SHOW QUALITY! It will reflect anything put in front of it with no issues.

I will tell you the exhaust tone is beautiful and only gets better as you smash the gas!", "The interior is FULL custom, over 20k invested and wrapped in real leather!

one stop shop for all of your cool Tri Chevy stuff and this car is no exception.  Before you is a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air in Midnight Blue and man is she a beauty.  This is a great car that has had a lot of love and care put in to it and you could drive it anywhere.  As you can see, the fit and finish are in great shape.  The paint was done about 5 years ago and presents very well.  The chrome is so bright you need shades inside to look at it.  Really, you could shave in this chrome.  The 57 Chevy's were the pinnacle of the Tri Chevy's and still one of the most sought after to this day.  This is truly one of those cars that you get in, hit the key, and go have fun.    So, as we roll around to the interior, you will see the custom silver and blue combination that goes along with the beautiful outside blue color.  There are no rips or tears in the seats, door panels or headliner.  Again, this car has been very well cared for.  You will see the center console that has the AM/FM/CD in it plus some nice cup holders for your favorite beverage as you cruise the boulevard.  Everything in this car is very comfortable, and very easy to reach or read.  This may not be your new lexus, but this car is extremely comfortable to get in and drive for hours on end.    Under the hood sits a 350 that is putting out about 300 ponies and looks beautiful under the hood.  You are also going to see power steering, power front disc brakes, and the all important A/C so you can drive this beauty around on the hottest of days in comfort.  All of this is mated to a Turbo 400 automatic transmission that all leads out to a posi trac rear end.  Rear gears are unknown, but we can tell you that this car cruises like it should.  No steep drag race gears here on this one.    The bottom side of this car is as clean as the top.  As you will see in the pics we can just not say enough how well this car has been taken care of.  There has been new wiring put in, new aluminum radiator, and a whole lot of love and TLC.  This is the car that needs to be in your garage today.    We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the offer.  They offer great rates and terms with as little as 10% down and no prepayment penalties.
