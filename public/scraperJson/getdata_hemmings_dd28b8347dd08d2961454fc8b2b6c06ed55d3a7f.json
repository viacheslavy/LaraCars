This little British sports car is in super nice condition. The bright red paint is in great shape and looks beautiful with the nice and shinny chrome. The body of this Healey lines up as it should. The interior looks like brand new. 4 years ago this Austin received a new leather interior. It still smells fresh. No cracks anywhere and the carpet looks like it was just put in. If you walk around this classic British car you will be amazed at how nice it is. Of course the best part of any classic car is when you jump in and take it out for a spin. This Austin Healey drives as good as it looks. The inline 6 cylinder engine feels strong and it is just fun to drive it. Shifted by a 4-speed manual transmission with overdrive there isn\"??t anything you will miss driving this roadster to the next car show. Wait did we already mention that the car won a trophy recently? Yes it is that nice. The Austin Healey 3000 series is a safe investment.

She's a 1965 BJ8 Phase 2 and I know some of you experts out there are wondering where the dual marker lights are- well do your homework and you'll find the early phase two cars had single marker lights and this is one of those cars. Us Pawluk's speak Healey.We bought this magnificent car because of the quality of the restoration. Starting with a very rust-free example this originally white car has been Ground Up, Frame Off, whatever you want to call it restored. Every nut and bolt has been touched and renewed, and the bottom of the car is just as pretty as the top. While notorious for rust issues this Healey came from Alabama and had such limited rust cut out of it we have the original metal and its extremely minor perhaps amounting to a total of a couple of sheets of paper worth in size- Amazing.Finished in correct Healey Red over Black coves this car is immaculate in fit and finish. The fit and finish is long past whatever the Healey Company was capable of back in the day. Leather interior, wood dash, new carpets- its all done and truly beautiful. Open the bonnet and you will see amazing quality work. Again, every nut and bolt has been turned, restored or refreshed. The BJ8 is arguably one of the top two or three dogs in Austin Healey collecting and long thought to be their best driving mannered and useable car.Not sure what else to say about this car if you know Healeys and have a good understanding of what it takes to get one to this level you know the value represented here.Drive it, show it, keep it in a bubble and polish it as a prized possession, the choice is yours once you make it yours.We stand behind our thoughts on this car by offering our travel expenses guarantee- come see the car and if we have materially misrepresented its condition we will gladly pay half of your travel expenses up to $500.00- this offer had been in place since we sold our first classic and we haven't paid the money yet.... We pride ourselves on having good cars and representing them properly.Additional pictures and video are available, please call 440-365-7311 for more photos, information or to schedule a test drive."], "Mileage:": "57618"}},

This car has been fully restored and includes some interesting and desirable upgrades. One is a modern five speed transmission providing synchromesh in all forward gears, better gear spacing, and overdrive fifth (and it dosen't leak).  Another is its aluminum wheels which are true knock-off type wheels, not bolt on types.  It also has a stainless steel exhaust system.  This car was under the stewardship of a single owner going back over 30 years.  That owner acquired the car as what he describes as a basket case.  Under his care it was body off frame restored and the body, frame, and undercarriage are all solid and rust free.  The paint presents very well without noticeable flaws.   Its attractive interior is finished in red leather with white piping is excellent throughout. The carpets are in fine condition with no indication of wear.  The engine was rebuilt and hardened valve seats installed in the head for compatibility with lead free fuel.  It has a Pertronix ignition and was upgraded to a modern alternator.  The engine is in top condition, holding excellent oil pressure, no exhaust smoke, and delivers strong performance.  The five speed is a Toyota Supra unit and one of the Smitty conversions which can be read about on various Internet and Healey sites.  The clutch action is smooth and the modern five speed transmission adds to the driving experience without the maintenance worries that accompanied the original gearboxes in these cars.  The brakes, suspension, and steering are all in good order.  This car needs nothing other than a new caretaker to drive and enjoy the Big Healey experience.

The 3- liter was a highly successful car, not only in the sales arena but also racing and rallies.  The BJ8 sports convertible was introduced in 1964 with a substantial power increase to 150 HP. Over 17,000 Mark III's were built with the majority coming to the US.  This particular car has gone through a restoration some time ago but still shows very well.  Furthermore this car starts perfectly and goes down the road strait and true.  There is plenty of power and this Healey gets a ton of looks.  Everything is in excellent working order as is the overdrive. The top and interior are equally as nice.  This would be an excellent candidate for tours or vintage rallies.", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.
