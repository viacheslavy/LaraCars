The ''Bullet Bird'' was a timeless design, featuring Ford's trademark ''rocket engine'' taillights, sharp rear tailfins and 'somewhat' restrained chrome ornamentation. This partially restored 1963 Thunderbird is a piece of Blue Oval lore, virtually as beautiful today as it was on the showroom floor. The classic lines are complimented by a Champaign exterior and matching original vinyl interior. The luxury T'bird was fully equipped for the era including: air conditioning, AM radio, power windows, and power driver seat. For ease of entry and exit, the steering wheel assembly slides 10'' to the right. Horsepower is furnished by a 300bhp 390ci-4V engine with factory chrome accents. The owner believes it to be the original FE motor - running superbly and never rebuilt. It is backed by Ford's classic 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic transmission. Power steering and power drum brakes were included as standard equipment and radial tires are mounted on factory wheels with original spinner hubcaps. There are very few of these classic Thunderbirds around for the serious Ford hobbyist, far fewer in this condition. This one belongs in your collection.
