With a four-barrel 289 and the perfect shade of red, this is a fun cruiser that will serve you well for years to come.  This A-code car is also believed to be a true GT, so the long-term value retention is definitely there on this one!  ", "  Candy Apple Red Mustangs always instantly attract an audience, and this one does it one better with a hints of sporty and premium attitude all rolled into one classic coupe.  You see this mix best on the white triple stripe on the rocker panels that sit between the 14-inch genuine wire wheels.  But we all know there are some GT-specific elements you need to get right, and this one has the fog lights in the grille and dual trumpet exhaust pipes coming through the rear valence.  Overall fit and finish is very good, making it the kind of car you want to drive around and show off. Chrome is bright, the stainless has been polished, and all the little trim pieces are in place, right down to the proper GT badges on the fenders and gas cap.  ", "  The factory-correct interior combo of parchment and burgundy showcases more of this Mustang's premium attitude.  The coupe was given a mid-life restoration, and there is evidence that it has been given the respect a classic like this deserves.  Everything from the bucket seats, to the door panels, to the carpeting carries the kind of quality that tells you this has always been under good care.  The five-dial gauge panel became standard in 1966, and it offers a sportier appearance while holding a complete set of gauges.  The knob-style AM/FM/cassette stereo fits nicely into the original radio's placement, and it provides a nice complement to the chrome trim around the gauges, heat/defrost switches, and the three-spoke steering wheel.  This is a total package that not only has a great vintage look and feel, but it's also comfortable enough for the daily commute.  ", "  Under the hood are more signs of great care.  This 289 cubic-inch V8 looks nice with the Ford blue air cleaner and valve covers.  But beyond just the attention-grabbing components that impress at car shows, this motor has real performance substance.  This is originally an A-code car, and so it should be no surprise that there is a four-barrel carburetor on this V8.  It exhales with a commanding presence through a newer dual exhaust.  The three-speed automatic transmission is a stout unit that keeps everything comfortable.  Plus, the Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires and front disc brakes give you the kind of grip that's welcome in all situations.  ", "  Complete with restoration recipes, maintenance records, and the owner's manual, this is a fleeting opportunity to get your hands on a red GT at fraction of the cost of a fastback.  And at such a great price, you know you better call today or may regret it tomorrow!"], "title": "1966 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "245", "price": "21995", "kilometers": 92752.414, "total_pages": 12, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27246217", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27246217", "year": "1966", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "57,646 miles", "Exterior Color": "Candy Apple Red", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Parchment", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

You absolutely could not duplicate this A-code pony with a strong-running 289 4V engine and a 4-speed for the asking price, even if you got the car for free. Bright red paint, a beautiful interior, and a lot of charisma make this a fantastic way to get into the Mustang hobby without a major investment.  ", "  Repainted in what appears to be Signal Flare Red, this handsome coupe looks like a million bucks. Originally hailing from down south where it's spent most of its life, the familiar Mustang sheetmetal is crisp and sharp thanks to expert restoration work. They built a lot of Mustangs, most of them coupes just like this, but that doesn't mean they're not handsome, timeless cars, and except for perhaps a Corvette or a Porsche 911, there aren't many cars that are more recognizable around the world. This one has been dressed up with white stripes, bright rocker panel moldings, and shiny chrome on the bumpers, it's nicely detailed in the way you'd want your Mustang to look. It's not a fake GT, not dressed up like some Shelby wanna-be, just a clean coupe that totally nails the factory look. The result is cheerful and appropriate, making this a car you'll be proud to show at any level because it fits together so well.  ", "  A handsome black Pony interior is a very desirable upgrade, and it's authentically restored with great detailing and attention to the little things. Look how neatly the seat covers fit, with just the right amount of padding underneath to create a supportive seat that doesn't look over-stuffed. Crisply marked gauges are all fully functional, another detail that you just don't see in cars priced like this, and the original AM radio still lives in the dash, which is an increasingly rare find. There's a 4-speed shifter sticking out of the transmission tunnel, so you know this neat coupe means business, and if you look closely, you'll spot the Disc Brakes emblem on the brake pedal, something that was still a novelty in 1966. Add in a fat wood-rimmed steering wheel, correct door panels, and a taut headliner, and it's hard to see how anyone could come out right-side-up financially with a sticker price like this. Interiors this nice are EXPENSIVE. The trunk also features a correct plaid mat and a pretty tired spare tire.  ", "  And this isn't just some 6-cylinder beater, either. For that price, you're getting a legitimate A-code 289, fully rebuilt and detailed. Someone took the time to do it right, as there's Ford Blue paint on the engine itself, a high-performance air cleaner assembly, vintage power steering pump, and a set of finned valve covers that look great. There's a Holley double-pumper carburetor on top of an aluminum intake manifold for a few extra horsepower, and it spins to life easily with a nice bark from the fresh dual exhaust system. The 4-speed clicks through the gears with authority, and 3.00 gears out back make it an excellent highway cruiser.
