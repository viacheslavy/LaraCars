This car lived in Canada so it features an unusual Kilometer speedometer. The glass T-Tops look great and still have the leather storage bag. This Trans Am is ready to hit the road or the local car show. It is priced to sell and will not last long. Come out today to see it in person!"]}},

And it's only part of a total package that includes a brown lower section and plenty of gold pin-striping to separate it all.  It's a unique setup, and it has just enough worn-in presence that lets people know it's all-original.  That's right! Nearly forty years later, and this still wears the same paint applied at the California factory.  But it's more than just history that attracts you to this coupe.

This is believed to also be quite original, and it has been given great care over the years.  So the high-back bucket seats with replacement seat covers are comfortable, the carpeting feels plush, and the door panels are complete.  Even the factory air conditioning is blowing cold. This is a true driver's machine with the classic T/A steering wheel, console-mounted shifter, and all the gauges set in the sporty machine-turned panel.", "Under the hood is the original 4.9-liter V8.  It has a very honest appearance, right down to the correct factory decals.  This V8 fires up with confidence, so you'll love taking it out on the road.  In fact, this is the era of sharp handling Firebirds.  So you get great features like four-wheel disc brakes and sway bars front & rear.  Plus, with power steering and the three-speed automatic transmission, it's easy to show off this survivor everywhere.", "A car like this needs the right paperwork, and that's why it comes with the factory build sheet, reproduction window sicker, and Pontiac Historic Services (PHS) documentation.
