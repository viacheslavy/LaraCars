This 914 fires right up and purs. Heres how the 914 came to be according to Classic Motorsports: In the late 60s Porsche needed a replacement for the 911s low-rent four-cylinder cousin the 912. At the same time VW needed a replacement for the Karmann-Ghia that would ideally be more than just a fanciful-bodied Beetle. Perhaps over some hefeweizen and sauerkraut Ferry Porsche and VW executive Heinz Nordhoff hammered out an agreement where their respective companies would build the car together.The car would be designed by Porsche and powered by a VW engine and under their original plan both manufacturers were to get a version of the car. But after Nordhoff died a new executive mandated that the car be sold in Europe as the VW-Porsche 914. In America it was simply sold as a Porsche.As one might expect from the cars size weight and mid-engine architecture the handling is quite sharp. This 1976 Porsche 914 for sale is located in our Indianapolis Showroom and can be seen in greater detail including a High Def video at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.

Performance was modest at first with base VW-derived engines of 1.7 and 1.8 liters. But the 2.0 Liter cars, like our fine example, gave sparkling performance and are the most desirable of the four-cylinder models today. Handling is superb with fine brakes and phenomenal steering. Bright period colors, like this delightful Yellow, suit the car well. Our car is reported to have been purchased new by an Alaskan oil field worker, who kept the car at his Texas home. It then went to an owner in Pasadena, CA who owned the car for about five years and sold it to its most recent owner. The hood and trunk lids were re-painted, but the paint and interior are otherwise original. It has covered 55k miles in all and is in robust mechanical health. The original owners manual and tools are included. The car is clean, sound, and a thrill to drive."], "Exterior:": "Sunflower Yellow", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "55228"}},

This is a 1976 year model of the 914! 1976 marked the last year for this awesome little sports car. The Porsche 914 or VW-Porsche 914 was a mid-engined targa-topped two-seater roadster designed sports car manufactured and marketed collaboratively by Volkswagen and Porsche from 1969 to 1976. Amazingly this one has maintained the same owner since it was purchased brand new all those years ago! A testament to the greatness of this car. It has gone almost 40 years without ever being damaged or repainted and it still has the original engine and transmission. Power goes to the rear wheels via the mid mounted 2.0l engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission which gives the near 2100lb vehicle plenty of power to excited. The low curb weight and mid-engine layout is the perfect layout for a nimble and playful sports car. This Porsche features air conditioning to help keep the cabin cool on those hot summer days. You will be able to play your favorite radio station on the AM/FM radio with cassette player. The targa top is something that is becoming more rare with newer cars but this car comes with a fully functioning example of this. Safety is paramount in any vehicle and you will be pleased to find seat belts inside. Whether you purchased and owned a 914 back when you could find them brand new in the dealerships or if you are a first time 914 owner you will love this one. The white paint job and vinyl interior go beautifully together and it will certainly turn heads. This could be perfect for weekend car shows or just a good drive in the country. Porsche is a staple when it comes to real driver\"??s cars and this is no exception. It is a machine that you can truly feel connected to when you\"??re behind the wheel. This excellent example of a classic German automobile won\"??t last long. We have financing and shipping options available to make the purchasing process easier even if you are not in the Houston area. Don\"??t miss this one. Call the Houston showroom at (832) 243-6220 for more information on this vehicle. If you are viewing this on a 3rd party website then you will be able to find more pictures and an HD video by visiting www.gatewayclassiccars.com.

The car they came up with was a mid-engined vehicle with seating for two and featured a targa top. A 4-cylinder boxer engine provided the power. Volkswagen needed a vehicle to replace the aging Karmann-Ghia while Porsche was looking for another option to add to their line up. The car sits low and the suspension was a combination of a 911-type torsion bar front suspension with a rear coil spring suspension. The headlights hide in the hood and pop-up when needed. The targa top can be stored in the trunk. The 914/6 was short lived, with only 3360 examples produced between 1970 and 1972. It was raced using different engine configurations."], "Exterior:": "Phoenix Red", "Condition:": "Good", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "57650"}},
