This iconic numbers-matching 1968 Oldsmobile has a 455-CID V8 Rocket engine with only 73,600 original miles. This all original survivor was a very smooth and powerful vehicle in 1968 and outputs an amazing 365 HP and just over 490 lb. ft. of torque! What makes this legend so interesting is that the Oldsmobile Rockets made from 1968-1976 tend to be more desirable engines because of their heavier castings, beefier crankshafts, and better flowing heads. This 1968 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight survivor is uniquely set off by its original factory Ivy Green exterior, pristine conditioned matching interior, traditional muscular stance , swooping rear quarters and all of the untouched originality. As you look inside this classic Olds you will notice the incredible condition of the unique interior that looks as if it has never even been sat in, and the attention to detail in the design that is the very reason that Oldsmobile luxury cars had such lasting success.  This Detroit time capsule is complete with 15'' inch chrome Oldsmobile hub-caps, radial tires, air conditioning, AM/FM radio, power brakes, power steering, power seats, power windows, tilt wheel and that vintage cloth interior. This untouched 1968 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight is an American legend and survivor that is sure to incite nostalgia and create many more memorable moments.

This is a blue convertible equipped the 455 CID V8 and automatic transmission. It has a gorgeous and well maintained black vinyl interior. With GM tossing out the 400 cubic-inch limit for intermediates and the 4-4-2 now coming standard with the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 from the big Oldsmobiles and previously used in the 1968-69 Hurst/Olds, Olds discontinued the 400 engine entirely and also offered the 455 as an option in the Cutlass S models and the Vista Cruiser wagons. There was an SX option that became available in 1970 and was available only on the Cutlass Supreme hardtop and convertible. The SX cars all had the 455 engine and TH-400 automatic transmission. This car is equipped with A/C, automatic convertible top, power brakes, power steering, seat belts, vinyl interior, radial tires and rally style wheels. This car is clearly a gem and shouldn\u00c3\u00a2??t be passed up at this price. Call the Houston showroom at (832) 243-6220 for more information on this vehicle.
