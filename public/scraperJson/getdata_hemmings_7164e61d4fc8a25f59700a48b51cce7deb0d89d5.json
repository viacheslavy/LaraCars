Shortly thereafter, it arrived in California, its namesake, where it spent the next 45 years. It wears its original color combination of Dark Olive paint with a black hardtop and matching black hubcaps, which makes it look understated and substantial, a look we like a great deal. It appears that it is a combination of original paint on the hood and deck, while the sides of the car have been repainted. Why, we can't say, but the color match is quite good and aside from a thin spot on the hood where it has been buffed through, it looks great. Not perfect, but if you want a casual SL that's easy to drive and offers no worries in the real world, it's ideal. The all-important notches on the front fenders are clearly visible and while the repaint seems to have been thick enough to obscure some of the spot welds on the inner fenders, they're still evident. You will also note that the usual trouble spots in the rear valence under the bumpers are clean. The Euro-spec cars offer the handsome headlights that were designed for the car, not the homely US-spec lights that were a compromise with the Feds. There's also a square fog light on the tail, another European feature, and without the US-spec overriders on the bumpers the design is extremely clean. There's just no angle from which this car doesn't look great.", "We strongly believe the black leather interior is original, which speaks to the car's excellent preservation. There's some moderate wear on the driver's seat but no splits, tears, or other damage, and it appears that even the carpets are original. The door panels are excellent and the wood on top of the dash is in very good condition, needing little more than some linseed oil to buff up to a soft shine. \\ All the gauges are fully operational and you'll note that the speedometer is measuring in KPH, not MPH. The Blaupunkt AM/FM/shortwave radio is an awesome addition and powers up, although we haven't tested all its functions. A glance behind the front seats and you'll see how the California coupe is different\u2014a full-width bench seat that could probably accommodate adults for short trips but is probably best reserved for children. Better yet, it folds down to create a rather large parcel shelf which, combined with the trunk, offers quite a bit of space. And speaking of the trunk, it's neatly finished with a proper mat, along with a factory jack assembly and tool roll. The removable hardtop is in excellent condition with a clean headliner, good chrome, and good weather seals.", "The car is powered by its original, numbers-matching 2.5 liter inline-6, which makes for entertaining performance in the relatively lightweight SL. Turn the key and listen for the fuel pumps to pressurize the system, then kick the starter and let it fire up and idle on its own. After a second or two, it settles into an even 700 RPM idle and is ready to run. No noises, no smoke, and good oil pressure suggest the robust Mercedes-Benz engine is healthy and it pulls with genuine enthusiasm at almost any speed. It's tidy under the hood, with mostly original finishes used throughout, correct fittings, and factory-style hardware. Recent work includes a new master cylinder, correct Bosch coil and distributor cap, as well as new plugs and wires.", "The desirable 4-speed manual transmission transforms the SL from pleasant little convertible to aggressive-feeling roadster. Clutch action is light and while the shifter is a bit vague, you won't miss a gear and it feels familiar right from the start. Somewhat tall 3.92 gears in the independent rear end make it feel punchy around town and the six doesn't mind spinning along at modern highway speeds. There's a recent exhaust system that gives it that characteristic six-cylinder baritone wail and with both power steering and power brakes, it's easy for anyone to handle. In addition to the master cylinder, the brake hoses, calipers, and pads are new, and there are fresh shocks at all four corners. The floors, rockers, and other critical areas show their California heritage with exactly zero issues\u2014that's factory undercoating on the floors, not rust or scale. This is a very solid SL. Factory 14-inch steel wheels with color-matched hubcaps carry new 195/75/14 radials.", "We've sold a lot of SLs, and we like this one most of all. It isn't the nicest, the most perfect, or the most valuable, but it drives quite well and the 4-speed completely transforms the Pagoda's personality. If you can live without the folding soft top (which isn't hard), it represents a lot of Mercedes-Benz quality and an awesome pedigree for the money.

This 1971 Mercedes-Benz 250 Sedan finished in Tobacco Brown over Cognac has recently undergone a full nut and bolt restoration to an incredibly high standard. After leaving the Mercedes-Benz Stuttgart factory in August of 1970, this 250 was then sent to Long Beach California where it sold new. The high quality Tobacco Brown finish is exceptional. The whole car was completely disassembled and stripped and painted in factory correct Tobacco Brown All of the body seals were replaced, all of the chrome was sent out and re-plated and the entire engine, transmission, suspension, brakes and steering components were all replaced or rebuilt with full powder coating and zinc plating. The engine bay and undercarriage is beautifully detailed and very authentic with keeping to correct factory standards. The interior looks absolutely fantastic and looks like it could have rolled out of the showroom floor. The wood in just about perfect and there is not a mark on any of the seats. The carpets are all just about new and there is not a mark on the dash top or center console. There is no cracking in the steering wheel and all of the switchgear looks just about new. Everything on the car works down to the original Becker radio with power antenna and the original factory AC blows cold along with a proper working heater. The dashboard dials are working correctly unlike most Mercedes of this vintage. All of the gauges are reading correctly and are crystal clear with no fade or hazing. This is a stunning example to run and drive. The engine idles smoothly and runs through the gears with ease. The transmission shifts as it should and the engine pulls strong. The ride is nice and tight but smooth at cruising speed. All of the exterior lights are working as they should including all turn signals, brake and reverse lights. There is absolutely no rust to be found on this 250. The body is arrow straight and the undercarriage is exceptional. This is an incredible opportunity to acquire one of the best examples of a Mercedes-Benz 114 chassis in existence. Accompanied with the sale of this car are service documents, original factory owners handbooks, service books, dealer books, the car care book, the Becker radio books and brochure, original wiring diagram and the parts books. There are two original keys, the original spare tire and tool kit along with the original jack."], "Exterior:": "Tobacco Brown", "Condition:": "Mint", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "27250"}},
