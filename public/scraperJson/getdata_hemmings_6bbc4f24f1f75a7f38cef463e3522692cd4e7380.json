It's markedly longer and a bit wider than its predecessor and affords a much smoother ride, and you'll find actual doors sitting where cutouts had been. Clad in very fresh Dune paint, with crisp Renegade lettering on its hood, this CJ7 has an undeniably capable look. It's well fitted from all angles, and you'll find its mega sturdy front and rear bumpers sitting nice and level both in front and back. With a 10,500 lb. capacity jack securely mounted on its hood and a sturdy new winch sitting up front, it not only looks like it could get itself out of any jam, but could ably come to the rescue if you came across any unfortunate motorist that got themselves in too deep. Should the weather turn while you're out blazing a path, a new soft top sits in place for protection.", "The interior sports a largely refurbished look - it's just a short yardage away from being in top form, and a few minor fixes will put it over the goal line. Step inside and you'll find freshly painted surfaces surrounding you, with an especially clean dash up front that features upgraded digital gauges in its cluster and a fresh pad on top. A pair of high backed buckets sits firmly in place with a bench behind. The air conditioning system is all present and accounted for but needs servicing to be in top form and while it has a new Painless Wiring harness, things like the radio, wipers, horn and LED spotlights do still need to be hooked up to be functional. So, while it's ''almost there'', it's still very enjoyable as it is. And it's worth mentioning that the entire floor area has been well-treated with spray on liner to protect it from wear and the elements.", "All the components needed for a great time both on and off the road are on board. There's a 258-cubic inch inline 6 under the hood with a 2-barrel Weber on top, and the engine bay it sits in has been well looked after, judging from its grime-free appearance and collection of fresh hoses. The engine pairs up with a 5-speed manual transmission with the versatile gearing to handle any driving conditions you encounter. The CJ7 has substantial ground clearance that combines with a firm ride reinforced by its Skyjacker shocks, so you have one very surefooted vehicle at your command when you engage its four-wheel drive - it's no mere coincidence that this model is still a favorite among competitive mud racers and rock climbers alike. An aluminum radiator sits up front, accompanied by an electric fan to keep temperatures in check during your offroad adventures. With its featured power steering and 4-wheel power brakes, this vintage Jeep has the manners you'd want in a frequent driver, as it patrols roads both paved and unpaved on its set of 15'' American Racing wheels outfitted with sturdy Kenda Klever M/T tires.", "Looking for a vintage off-roader that's equipped to handle whatever you send its way?

The red paint instantly turns attention to this classic icon.  The black Renegade lettering is the perfect match for the other dark elements this 4x4 has to offer like on the bumpers, fender flares, removable doors, and folding soft top.  It's a total impression that looks just as good driving down High Street as it does exploring the inner forest.", "Inside you get an all-black interior that looks quite good.  There has been recent investment in new seat covers, which always sets a nice tone for the whole interior.  With the roll bar painted red, this has the perfect color-coordination when the top is down (the way Jeeps are meant to be.) In fact, while all jeeps were made for the rugged outdoors, this one goes further with the entire floor and steel sides covered in tough liner paint.  But even going out in nature doesn't mean you have to have it rough, and that's because the AM/FM stereo has connections for Bluetooth and iPods.", "Jeep people will love looking over your engine bay because it looks so tidy and correct.  In fact, it's even suspected that this is the original 304 cubic-inch V8.  This AMC motor is that perfect power plant that combines V8 muscle with Jeep-level robustness.  On the road, this total package feels good with the three-speed automatic transmission and the newer radial tires on those bright Eagle Alloys wheels.  But what you really want this classic Jeep for is a little off-road fun.  So on the trail, the extra wallop of V8 power is a great partner with the sturdy 4x4 components like the two-speed transfer case.", "Bold packaging, the right features, and V8 power \u2013 this is the CJ7 is the right way to enjoy an icon.
