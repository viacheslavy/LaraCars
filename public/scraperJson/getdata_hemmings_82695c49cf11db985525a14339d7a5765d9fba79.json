Combining the traffic-stopping looks of a 1962 Corvette with the C4's fully independent suspension and powerful brakes, an injected LS1 mill, and a set of late-model Z06 wheels makes this stunning roadster more than a handful for anything else on the street.", "If you want to stop traffic or take home trophies, this Corvette will do it. The original 1962 fiberglass was treated to a full cosmetic restoration to the very highest standards. That means no visible bonding seams, no cracks, and lots of laborious block sanding to get it ultra-straight. It was painted a traditional 1961 color scheme of Silver Blue with Inca Silver side covers (You'll remember that there were no two-tone Corvettes in 1962). Whatever year it comes from, it looks fantastic and with two-stage urethane, that shine looks deep enough to swim in. The grille is from a '59, but the toothy countenance is a Corvette trademark and certainly looks right here on a slightly later car. More stainless trim wraps around the side coves and highlights the rear end, which was a preview of things to come. There's not much to give away the secret living underneath aside from the lowered stance and the modern wheels and the car just looks right from any angle.", "Given this car's performance envelope, the stock interior is more than up to the task with light blue bucket seats, reproduction door panels, and factory-style carpets. Factory gauges remain in the dash, although the tach has been upgraded to reflect the modern engine's wider operating band. The smaller-diameter steering wheel is wrapped in black leather, too, and the shifter looks vintage but connects to a 4L60E 4-speed automatic gearbox. A/C was added so skillfully that it's almost undetectable at a glance and there's a trick AM/FM/iPod stereo radio in the center stack that blends in seamlessly with the 1962 surroundings. A white convertible top is there for everyday use, but if you're doing it right, you'll probably never need it. The trunk is finished to stock specs with a rubber mat and cardboard bulkhead, again reinforcing the illusion.", "Underneath that vintage fiberglass, you'll find C4 Corvette underpinnings complements of a Newman Car Creations frame. That means a 350 horsepower fuel injected LS1 V8, the aforementioned 4-speed automatic transmission, and fully independent suspension with giant disc brakes. The engineering is impressive and the line between old and new so skillfully blended that it's hard to see where the two generations meet. It radically transforms the old 'Vette's behavior, making it feel contemporary and insanely fast. Up top, the LS1 looks modern with its red coil covers, serpentine belt drive, aluminum radiator with electric fan, although the goal was to keep it looking OEM. Underneath, the frame was powdercoated black and with the original floors behind it, the show is worth crawling under to see. It was fitted with a custom dual exhaust system that really cackles and there's a massive disc brake at each corner, giving it extraordinary braking abilities. 17-inch wheels were borrowed from a C5 Z06 and wear 245/40/17 Goodyear run-flat radials all around.", "Not quite designed to deceive, this is a potent sports car in its own right. Beautifully finished and expertly engineered, it's a no-compromises approach to performance that seems to make everyone happy.

This 1960 roadster airs on the classier side of possibilities thanks to its timeless Ermine White exterior and striking Red cockpit. But don't let that fashionable look fool you \u2013 there's always serious firepower under American fiberglass! Speaking of American, there's never a bad time for a great version of America's favorite sports car. So, pledge a few minutes to check out this clean, road-ready C1!", "BODYWORK/TRIM", "Driven sparingly since a detailed, ground-up restoration that was completed in 2000, this lust worthy Vette has spent the past year receiving an extensive, body-on freshening. As you can see from our high-resolution photography, the car's profile features great alignment, reflecting clean 2-stage that's been polished to a stellar shine. That body's combination of form, fit and flash reinforces the fact that this Chevy has spent almost two decades avoiding unpleasant weather. And today, it rolls as one fully sorted curve carver that's virtually guaranteed to captivate and impress!", "1958 to 1962 was a banner era for the Corvette, as Chevrolet wanted to prove its new flagship could run with the best cars in the world while retaining classic style that would eventually bear an American icon. At the front of this sensational drop-top, aggressive chrome grilles ride between chrome-trimmed headlights, extravagant header ornamentation, a chrome tag bracket and small, chrome-trimmed parking lamps. In front of those grilles, intricate bumpers bend around dramatic fenders, which frame sporty cross-flag emblems in sharp stainless trim. Between those fenders, a sculpted hood leads the eye to a classy wraparound windshield that's cleared by bright stainless wipers and capped in fresh black canvas. At the back of that hood, lightweight doors hang a small mirror above traditional chrome handles. And at the back of those doors, a sculpted 'ducktail' decklid hangs a translucent Corvette roundel between chrome-trimmed tail lights, trick exhaust tips and more bumpers that bend around equally dramatic quarters.", "ENGINE", "Tilt this roadster's lightweight hood and you'll find a 283 cubic inch, dual-quad V8 that proudly displays a correct 3756519 casting number. Consistently chosen over Rochester's much-hyped Ramjet fuel injection as GM's ultimate hot rod option, this stout small block is widely regarded as the starting point of Chevrolet's amazing performance legacy. The car's reliable Carter carburetors, which breathe through a small, louvered air cleaner, funnel life in to a clean aluminum intake. At the sides of that intake, cast iron heads hang finned Corvette valve covers over fully restored exhaust manifolds. Behind those manifolds, a chrome-capped ignition system sequences fire through chrome-sleeved ignition wires. And in front of those wires, a beefy radiator flows coolant around a rebuilt generator. In addition to its killer powerplant, this Corvette offers a thoroughly detailed engine bay that's complete with stainless fluid lines, an old school AC fuel bowl, fresh tower clamps and a Delco-topped battery. And the car's first rate aesthetics, which mix smooth, Satin Black framing with a bright, Chevy Orange core, create great texture and excellent contrast.", "DRIVETRAIN/SUSPENSION", "Flip this Vette upside down and you'll find a solid, Satin Black X-frame that's bolted to clean, hit-free floors. Behind the hot motor, a correct Borg Warner 4-speed twists torque through a rebuilt GM axle. Naturally, that drivetrain rolls on a restored double A-arm front and solid axle rear suspension. At the corners of the car, standard drum brakes supplement good handling characteristics with solid and confident stops. Exhaust is funneled through 2.5-inch, true-dual pipes, which make excellent use of long turbo mufflers. And power meets the pavement though factory steelies, which spin 6.70R15 American Classic whitewalls around traditional stainless wheel covers.", "INTERIOR", "Open this C1's tossable doors and you'll find a seamless Red interior that appears to have been completely replaced during the car's thoughtful rebirth. Seating comes courtesy of familiar vinyl thrones. From the driver's perch, a painted and padded dash hangs rebuilt gauges between a polished mirror and both radio and heater deletes. Below that dash, a polished shifter sails textured carpet, which is protected by Corvette-themed floor mats. At the sides of that carpet, stainless-trimmed door panels hang small armrests behind traditional handles. And in front of the driver, a speed-drilled steering wheel spins a color-keyed rim around a polished cross-flag hub.", "THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION IS INCLUDED WITH THE SALE", "Miscellaneous service receipts", "A highly desirable drop-top that wraps a well-maintained, body-off restoration around a hot V8 and tough 4-speed transmission, this slick Corvette offers a little something for everyone. And what's better: it's exactly the kind of classic that provides endless fun on the highway and celebrity status in the parking lot. Don't miss the opportunity to experience a stellar piece of American automotive history!", "SUMMARY", "Ground-up restoration completed in 2000 / Body-on freshening completed in 2017", "Correct 283 cubic inch Chevrolet V8 / Dual-quad induction", "Correct Borg-Warner 4-speed manual transmission", "Ermine White paint / Sateen Silver coves / Black top", "Red vinyl interior", "15-inch steel wheels"], "Exterior:": "Ermine White", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "81531"}}
