This car is wearing it's original black and gold 2-tone colors and looks to be a 60's or 70's repaint as it does not have a clear coat finish. The interior is in good condition for the year though not perfect and does appear to be original. This heater works properly, It has the Original AM Radio still in working condition, It has the original service and owners manual as well as the original warranty book and certificate. It has had approximately $2,500 worth of recent work done to the brakes, brake lines, and has new fuel lines. It has also had a recent transmission service. The engine starts easily and runs great(sounds fantastic too) and the transmission shifts smoothly without any hint of slip. All 4 tires are in excellent condition with a matching spare that's never touched the road. All trim pieces ie. badges, emblems, hubcaps, interior and exterior are all there and in very good condition. This is a nice very hard to find classic Oldsmobile.
