Mercedes Benz revamped its SL lineup of sporting luxury convertibles with the introduction of the 380SL. The 380 was a further development of the R107 chassis which was first used in 1972 by the 350SL and then later by the 450SL. Like its forebears the 380SL was a heady mix of V8 power refined luxury and sporty underpinnings and it was a very popular model during its run in the US. The 380SL so named for it\"??s 3.8L V8 had a smaller engine than the 450SLand was consequently 120 pounds lighter. This is a nicely restored low mileage vehicle looks as good as it sounds. It is silver with a grey interior. It is loaded with usual features in an 80\"??s Mercedes. The engine was rebuilt with less than 150m miles since the rebuild. Its fresh paint is PPG with Matrix European Clearcoat. It also comes with a hardtop a stand for the hardtop a fitted cover for the car. Come see it and take home and enjoy the top down in this beautiful weather. It may not be here long.

Setting this vehicle apart from all others, aside from mileage is the wonderful condition and complete documentation from the day it was delivered new to the day it arrived to us. Having been lovingly cared for by just two owners from new this example has been meticulously cared for with an \u2018open checkbook philosophy' and all service records retained to show exactly what was done, at what mileage, and at what cost. This is one of the only truly complete examples available with all books, manuals, a fully stamped Mercedes-Benz service booklet, dozens of service records, jack, spare tire, and best of all, the original window sticker! Further, this magnificent motorcar is incredibly original. The entire interior is as it came from the factory and everything is functioning. There is no dye work, nothing replaced, nothing cracked, etc. The interior is a time capsule and a testament to how it was kept. Another nice and unusual appointment are the polished wheels. Whereas most were either silver or chrome from the factory, even those that were polished were almost all chromed or painted as the surface is so delicate. These wheels are completely original and if you look at the dozens of other cars out there, this is the only one that has such incredible condition AND originality. We are proud to offer what we believe to be one of, if not the best example of the coveted 450SL Mercedes available anywhere.
