"mileage": "12571", "description": ["All the Mopar fans out there already know what kind of a rare sight it is to find a 1970 Dodge Challenger convertible.  So when there has been a ton invested to give it the legendary High Impact color treatment, R/T upgrades, and a six-pack, then you know this is a head-turning muscle machine.  ", "  The Challenger's shape is one of the most popular muscle car profiles in history.  It only gets better with one that has been rendered in the iconic High Impact color of Go Mango Orange.  This convertible is simply stunning in the sunlight thanks to a professional respray of this highly desirable paint.  But the true love is in the details. Form-fitting chrome bumpers, R/T badging, aggressive R/T hood, and Cragar SS wheels give it an authentic 70s street-eating personality.  Plus, the bodywork is excellent.  This Challenger has the iconic rear fender kick that's showcased by the full-length white stripe.  And more than just aggressive, when the pristine white roof is in place, it gives the Challenger an upper-class appearance.  ", "  With the flip of a switch, the electric folding roof reveals a clean white interior.  So no matter with the top up or down, this one has a premium attitude.  It's a rare gem that has plenty of features you'll love, including bucket seats and a center console. This one stays as close to original-style spec as possible, so the driver-oriented interior still has the correct heat/defrost controls and a subtle upgrade to an AM/FM cassette stereo. The woodgrained steering wheel matches the door panels, console, and dash.  Also the instrument panel is full of original gauges, including a factory tach. But more than just looking great, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the condition of soft parts like the door panels and dash pad.  These details are how you can really tell there has been a serious investment in creating a cut-above classic.    ", "  We know you've already fallen in love/lust with this Mopar, and the best feature still awaits under the hood.  While the engine bay is exceptionally tidy, there will be one singular focus by the crowds once they see that big air grabber.  You and everyone else will instantly know that you are looking at the legendary triple-deuce Six Pack carbs on top.  This 340 cubic-inch V8 is not only dressed with six barrels of Holley carbs, but also an Edelbrock intake, Powermaster alternator, Be Cool aluminum radiator, and a set of Hooker competition headers that add power as they feed the rumbling X-pipe performance dual exhaust.  Oh yeah, this is a total power package.  But we also know you want to be seen all around town in a droptop like this.  That's why it comes with great anytime driving features like the A727 Torqueflite three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes.

For example, in most gearheads' minds the term Plum Crazy recalls one of Chrysler's most creative and confident eras. R/T, short for Road/Track, invokes visions of muscle cars prowling small town streets. Dana 60 or Super Track Pak incites visions of late-night stoplight brawls and octane-fueled quarter-miles. And who could forget Hemi, the incredible V8 that led Chrysler through an era of epic performance. Well, our latest top-notch MoPar funnels all of those appealing attributes in to one exclusive, investment grade classic. That's right, it's a documented, authentic Hemi/4-speed Challenger R/T that seals a correct Super Track Pak chassis in correct Plum Crazy Metallic paint. Looking for some first class Chrysler muscle? Look no further!     BODYWORK/TRIM    The beneficiary of a detailed restoration that was completed sometime around the year 2000, this spectacular, Hemi-powered Challenger has been lovingly massaged into a better-than-new show stopper. During that acute rebuild, the car's all-original body was stripped to bare metal, coached into shape and thoroughly block-sanded into virtually flawless surfaces. Once those surfaces were completely clean and fully prepped, a spectacular coat of correct Plum Crazy Metallic 2-stage was buffed to a wet looking shine. And today, this clean Dodge rolls as one super slick brute that, according to a 2015 Vehicle Inspection Report conducted by David Wise of MMC Detroit, carries an appraised value of $240K!    Given its resurgence in popularity, no doubt aided by the current LC-based version, the Challenger is considered by some to be the quintessential American muscle car: a status that naturally invokes an aggressive and exciting aesthetic. At the front of this Chally, a 1970-exclusive grille hangs a brash Challenger R/T badge between pristine headlights, amber parking lamps and a mirrored bumper.

The pony car world was truly rocked by the entrance of the Dodge Challenger in 1970 with Chrysler producing 76,935 of the new E-Body vehicle. The muscular lines and eye-catching color combos were only eclipsed by the throaty tone pure American Horsepower being forced out the exhaust, often by Big Block Mopar V8\u00c3\u00a2??s. You would turn heads everywhere and be the envy of the neighborhood cruising around in this bad-boy in 1970. Fast forward over 40 years, and the same remains true.This particular Challenger has had new life breathed into it. Being born a 6 cylinder car, this Challenger underwent a full overhaul to become the 440 R/T Tribute that you see before you today. Gone is the whimpy slant six. In its place now sits a newly rebuilt 440 Big Block Mopar, with a 4 barrel Edelbrock carburetor, long tube headers, and a mild cam. A custom Shaker hood was added as well for the ultimate in nostalgic muscle. Backing that up is the tried and true Torqueflight 727 3 Speed automatic with the classic Slap Stick pistol grip shifter.Once you\u00c3\u00a2??re done drooling over the engine, take the whole car in and admire the lines on this beauty thanks to Dodge designers led by Bill Brownlie. The bright Hemi Orange paint is as loud as the sweet 440 and is paired beautifully with a black vinyl top and matching black interior. In the right sunlight, you can see that there is a light pearl flake coat over the orange, giving this nice Challenger restomod just the right pop to set it apart from the crowd. Inside, you can appreciate the fully restored interior. When we say fully, we mean it. The carpet, seats, dash pad, panels, gauge cluster, all of it is new, and all of it is just waiting for you to hope in and go anywhere!Additional features on this Challenger include air conditioning, AM/FM/CD radio, power brakes, power steering, seat belts, vinyl interior, radial tires with raised white letters, and rally wheels.

Made as Chrysler's road going version of their Trans Am racing cars, the Challenger T/A and AAR Cuda had a whole lot of attitude.  Chrysler didn't bother following the SCCA rules capping displacement at 5.0 Liters and carburetion at 4 barrels.  They used a beautiful engine, their 340 CID, four bolt main V8 with an Edelbrock aluminum intake and 3 2 barrel carbs sitting on top.  This set up was known as the \"Six Pack\" and coupled with the free flowing exhaust, really let the 340 run.  That trick exhaust that exits just in front of the rear wheels was shipped in the trunk of the car and installed at the dealer.  It became one of the most notable features of a Challenger T/A.  Additionally, all T/As came with front disc brakes, and an 8 3/4 rear end with 3.55 gear ratio.  More eye catching characteristics include the black side striping and fiberglass fresh air hood also in matte black.  This particular example is finished in a classic Mopar color: Lime Green.  The car has been restored in the late 1990s and well cared for since.  She retains her original matching 340 CID V8 and a replacement automatic transmission.  The car runs and drive beautifully and would make a great cruise night car.  With roughly 7,000 miles on the restoration, this car has been well tested, but still shows incredibly well.  It comes with a broadcast sheet and its original fender tag, decoded below.  This is a limited production Mopar which will make a great investment for the muscle car enthusiast.  You can see this 1970 Dodge Challenger T/A in greater detail in our St. Louis showroom or at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.

occupies a rare but multifaceted place in automotive history.  Sporting unusually low actual miles (under 57,000!) and in faithfully restored condition (with numbers matching no less), it's a veritable museum piece, but one that gives a hearty nod to a bona fide Trans Am racing heritage. The level of meticulousness and detail that went into its restoration is truly rare. Its history is properly documented as an entry in the National T/A registry. It even comes complete with the same factory broadcast sheet it rolled off the assembly line with!  ", "  Challengers of this era cut an impressive presence on their own, but the restoration that went into this T/A take this one to a whole different level. Its quality and precision are evident right away. The bright red paint job, not only factory-correct, but literally the same hue it was brought to life with, shines convincingly from all angles and is complemented by the broad blackness of its scooped hood - a feature unique to T/As - as well as the stripes occupying the upper region of its sides. The black 340 6-pack decals adorning both of its fenders give proper notice that this is truly a special Challenger.  In the back, the spoiler - with its Challenger T/A lettering - remains unfaded. Take a lap around the car and you'll notice the uniformity of the lines - its hood, doors, fenders and trunk all line up with admirable precision. The chrome looks great, as does its fully functional scoop on that black hood, and the rest of the trim follows suit.  Even the hood pins have a shine to them. There have been no shortcuts taken with this one and it has clearly been looked after carefully since its restoration, almost as if it's been hermetically sealed for protection.    ", "  Not surprisingly, the interior reflects the same care and condition. The black, high-backed vinyl bucket seats straddle an equally black center console with its signature low-profile gear selector - and all have been faithfully restored. The door panels also look supple and shiny, as well. The rear vinyl bench seat, the black trim on each side and the package shelf to the rear also attain the same high standard.  Everything inside retains its authentic stock look and the original AM radio still occupies its place in the dash. Even the dash pads, almost always where you see the first signs of decline in an interior, look good. The factory gauges are all in working order, with lenses that retain a fresh transparent look. The manual windows all roll up and down smoothly and seal properly at their top position. All are testimony to just how much attention went into this restoration.   ", "  The Challenger T/A has a mechanical history unlike any other. Relatively few of them were made and they were only around for this 1970 model year. Their T/A model designation reflects a true racing heritage, as they were configured specifically to be the street-ready counterpart to their brethren in Trans "], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1970 Dodge Challenger ", "total_results": "63 AdvancedSearch", "price": "74995", "kilometers": 91592.325, "total_pages": 4, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/33866463", "brand": "Dodge", "reference_id": "33866463", "year": "1970", "model": "Challenger", "specs": {"Engine": "340 V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "56,925 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Stock #": "2487-DFW", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Bright Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Bright Red"}}
