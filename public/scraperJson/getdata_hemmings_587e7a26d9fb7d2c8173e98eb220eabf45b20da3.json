These cars could be ordered in any color you wish. Many customers opted to choose a color with a special meaning in their life. A Two-Tone color scheme could be opted for at no extra cost such as this fabulous car. When the two-tone scheme was opted for, Rolls Royce suggest the darker color for the lower section, however the customer was free to choose as they wished. This example was ordered in a beautiful combination of what appears to be Ocean Foam & Scots Pine Green. This example has a stack of maintenance records as well. It has been cared for over the years. We have receipts for thousands spent in repair & upkeep. The exterior finish is in good condition & presents very well, however there are a number of flaws. The paint is chipped along the beltline on the driver's door. Also there are a pair of shallow dings along the driver's door, lower ride side (see photos below). There are also some tiny rust bubbles showing on the top door edges, again see photos below. Without knowing the history of this Silver Shadow, it appears that the interior is original but that the car may have been painted once. The interior is compiled of quality leather hide & Rolls Royce accompaniments. The air conditioning is in need of service, not blowing cold. The gauges and dash show well as does the wood. Although not perfect, very presentable. The leather shows well front to back. The wood trim is in decent condition, the coating-finish is chipping in many places on the door panels especially, not too bad, just showing some age. Under the hood is the 6.7 liter V8 engine. The firewall, inner fenders, and core support are in good condition. In 2007, the rear motor mounts were replaced, the power steering lines were replaced, as well as the brake pressure switches. In 2009 the fuel pump was replaced and several hoses and belts and service.

This particular example is finished in the classic and highly striking 'Acrylic White' color paint with 'Tan Connolly leather hides' and Fawn carpeting. All the chromework including the Rolls Royce grille is in absolutely outstanding and the interior is quite stunning with beautiful leather seats in very fine condition with virtually no signs of wear and with no rips or tears. The leather dashboard is also in exceptional condition (always garaged from the sun) and the convertible top headliner is also in very fine condition. The original and magnificent burled walnut woodwork is also in very fine condition and virtually flawless condition throughout. The matching 'Tan' color power soft top has been replaced at some time and is in very fine condition and the car has it's matching tan boot. All the power options and electric windows are working as they should.The Corniche was Rolls Royce's coupe and convertible versions of the Silver Shadow saloon and was first produced between 1971 and 1996. The model was assembled in Crewe and finished in London at the renown Rolls Royce coachbuilders 'Mulliner Park Ward' as a continuation of their 1965 Silver Shadow coupe and 1967 drophead, with the Corniche name applied in 1971. The Corniche coupe was discontinued in 1982. Total production of the coupes (1971-82) was only 1,108 and of the convertibles (1971-87) was only 3,239. The car as reworked in 1986 as the Corniche II (with 1,226 produced), in 1989 as the Corniche III (with 452 produced) and in 1993 as the Corniche IV (with only 244 produced) when production was moved to Crewe after the closure of Mulliner Park Ward and the final form in 2000 was as the Corniche V after which production ceased in 2001.This obviously always very well maintained Rolls Royce engine runs extremely strong and these cars are not slow - the engine purrs like a kitten, never stalls or idles rough and is extremely reliable - there is plenty of power to pull away at the lights and it cruises at high speeds with absolute ease. The transmission shift is almost imperceptibly smooth and the temperature always remains cool. The Corniche is truly a sensual car that you can drive with your fingertips, smooth and relatively silent, it's thoroughly therapeutic for both drivers and passengers. The delightful precision action of the electrically powered steering column gear change and the ultra light weighted power steering allows one to park this 5000lbs of pure luxury with literally one finger and this long but actually quite slender car is anything but ponderous thanks to it's torque and brilliant turning radius! The ride is truly luxurious from a high riding position and the soft feel of the Corniche is like no other car on the road. This particular model drives particularly well and must be driven to be fully appreciated.Without a doubt you will look long and hard to find a finer example of this rare and very collectible and super striking Corniche drophead coupe, an obvioulsy always garaged with no accidents and absolutely no rust example! This is one of the last in the original line of cars hand built in the legendary Rolls Royce Crewe factory and then converted at their renown coachbuilder's Mulliner Park Ward, of London England with a quality and craftsmanship that far surpasses that of today's mass produced models with many BMW parts - this is indeed a rare opportunity to own a piece of classic automotive history, from a time when Rolls Royce was truly building the world's finest automobiles - a great investment for the Rolls Royce enthusiast or collector or simply an outstandingly striking example of a very rare and unusual Rolls Royce for the discerning luxury classic car owner!"], "Exterior:": "White", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "70700"}},
