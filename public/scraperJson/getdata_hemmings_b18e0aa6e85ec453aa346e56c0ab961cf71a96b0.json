Unveiled at the March 1961 Geneva Auto Salon, the E-Type was a sensational follow-up to the racing-purposed D-Type that scored three consecutive wins in the grueling 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1955, '56 and '57. The E-Type's body styling clearly drew its inspiration from the D-Type, and it adapted its monocoque construction and front space frame that supported the DOHC inline-6 engine, independent front suspension and hinged front bodywork. It surpassed even the D-Type in its sophistication, replacing the racer's live rear axle with a brilliantly designed independent rear-suspension system with inboard Dunlop disc brakes. The E-Type's engine displacement grew from the original 3.8L to 4.2L in 1964, when it was coupled with an improved 4-speed synchromesh manual transmission. The Series 2 E-Type introduced in 1968 brought significant design changes, most notably the elimination of the Series I's headlight covers, an enlarged grille opening for improved cooling and new larger tail lights beneath a full wraparound rear bumper. American-market E-Types incorporated the 4.2L inline-6 engine with new ribbed cam covers, dual Stromberg carburetors and dual exhaust. This beautifully restored 1969 Jaguar E-Type Series 2 Fixed Head Coupe was with its previous owner's family for 47 years. It shows a believed-correct 57,000 original miles, with only 500 miles since the completion of the restoration. Its combination of red paint and redline tires on chromed wire wheels is very popular with enthusiasts, who will also appreciate its sharp black-leather interior incorporating Smiths gauges and a signature wood-rimmed aluminum steering wheel. Ready to enjoy on the open road, this fine Series 2 E-Type is generously equipped with power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, tinted glass and a Blaupunkt stereo with cassette player."], "Exterior:": "Red", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "500"}},
