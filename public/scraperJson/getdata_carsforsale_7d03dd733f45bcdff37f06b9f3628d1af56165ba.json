lover of individuality, this is the time to pay attention.  This 1966 Ford Mustang convertible is a code-76C bench seat car.  So more than just being restored in the factory-correct colors, you're looking at the rarest version of the '66 Mustang by a wide margin.  ", "  If you're going to have a Mustang, it's hard to beat Candy Apple Red.  The paint and bodywork were restored to quite nice standards.  That's why the gaps and alignment are up to factory criteria, and this icon has a great luster when you take in out in the sunshine.  The newer black roof looks smart when in place, and it coordinates nicely with the darker elements like the updated grille and the accents on the factory wheel covers.  Add in complete trim and mirror-like chrome bumpers, and you have a true all-American cruiser.  ", "  The first thing that welcomes you when you open the door are the plush red crinkle vinyl bucket seats.  Not only does the red-on-red appearance look fantastic with the top down, but also we know you love that front bench seat.  Sure, it has been updated (cup holders and storage were not a factory package in 1966,) but you'll love reminding everyone that less than 3,200 code-76C bench seat convertibles were made this year.  Oh yeah, it's a rare treat considering Ford produced more than double the amount of expensive luxury fastbacks in '66! And more than just rarity, you'll love how this updated interior includes the desirable Pony package that adds prancing horses embedded into the seats.   The five-dial gauge panel became standard in 1966, which offers a sportier look and holds a complete set of readouts.  And we know how much you'll love grabbing the factory three-spoke steering wheel, putting the chrome shifter into drive, and taking this Mustang out for an all-day droptop cruise.  ", "  Under the hood there's been a recent transplant to Ford's iconic 289 V8.  Complete with Holley four-barrel carburetor, you get great performance and terrific firing power that comes from a solid investment in an updated V8.  But you can tell people anything you want, because when you lift the hood, it looks nice and original.  A coat of Ford blue paint on the block, matching Powered by Ford valve covers, and a shining air cleaner that includes the 289 decal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it all looks like it belonged since day one.  The V8 moves the lightweight Mustang enthusiastically through any traffic, making it a joy to drive.  Adding to this go-anywhere feeling in this classic is the power steering and C4 three-speed automatic transmission.  And despite the period-correct styled steel wheels, they are riding modern 185/70/R14 Bridgestone tires for maximum comfort.  ", "  You already know that first-generation Mustang convertibles are always in demand.  But when you have an opportunity of the rarest one around, you know this is a deal that you'll regret missing.

But once in a while you find one that nails it, like this stunning 1966 Ford Mustang convertible. It includes a sharp 5.0 under the hood, an upgraded suspension, and plenty of appearance mods to grab your attention. After seeing this car, maybe the Mustang guys will rethink their next restoration.  ", "  Sure, it's Signalflare Red, but somehow it clings to the sheetmetal on this early pony in an entirely different way. The body mods are significant, but since you definitely don't want to erase the inherent goodness of the original design, they stick to period-looking upgrades. Look closely and you'll find a custom Eleanor-style hood, a deep chin spoiler, and Shelby-style C-scoops in the quarters. The bright paint is a few years old and has some use, but a professional cut and buff would really wake this car up. Panel gaps are excellent, including that custom hood and for a unit-body convertible, this one is reassuringly straight and solid. There's a custom mesh grille behind the factory pony corral, the bumpers have been painted to match the body so it has a cool monochromatic look, and, of course, there's no avoiding the GT350 stripes that reveal a seriousness of intent.  ", "  The two-tone red and white Pony interior is really the only logical choice here, but it sticks to the original design to keep it looking right. The seats feature fresh reproduction Pony seat covers, and there are matching door and side panels to complete the look. Red carpets continue the theme and again, they're original spec. The dash has been given a new dash pad and the original gauges take care of monitoring the warmed-over 5.0 under the hood. A trick touch-screen entertainment system has been added in the dash and feeds new speakers throughout, including subwoofers in the trunk. There's a white convertible top that fits well and includes a split glass rear window that's a nice upgrade over the usual cloudy vinyl. The trunk is pretty bare, but as I mentioned, it's full of stereo gear and exactly zero signs of a hard life in a snowy climate.   ", "  The engine is a 5.0 V8, better known as a 302, equipped with a whole host of upgrades to make it live up to the legend. A polished Edelbrock intake manifold inhales through a matching 4-barrel carburetor, MSD ignition components light the fires, and there's a serpentine drive system for the accessories borrowed from a late-model. With chrome valve covers and an Edelbrock air cleaner, it looks highly detailed under the hood. Functionally, things like the aluminum radiator and chrome shock tower braces are a definite improvement. It's linked to a T5 5-speed manual transmission and an 8-inch rear out back, so there's no worry that you'll break it.

Oh yeah, this is your dream pony car, and it's available right now!  ", "  Crisp lines, great detailing, and a beautiful red paint job make this one timeless.  Bright red is always a great choice on a Mustang for highlighting the fastback's dramatic long hood/short deck design, and the sporty side cove that carves through its flanks. Workmanship is good in most the main areas, because everyone knows fastbacks get plenty of eyeballs.  It even has some nice GT-style upgrades with the fog lights in the grille, rocker panel stripes, badging, and trumpeted dual exhaust.    ", "  This special feeling continues inside.  A pristine black interior is always desirable in a classic, and this one really goes the extra mile.  The seats look crisp; the door panels feel confident as you pull them closed; and the black carpet feels plush.  And this is far from a sea of darkness.  The interior is warmed up with everything from the wood on the three-spoke steering wheel to the bright strip that runs along the desirable center console. And because everybody will want to go for a ride in your vintage fastback, you can keep them entertained with an AM/FM/cassette stereo that has a digital tuner for easy integration for modern music players.  But this coupe was truly made for driving, and you know that the moment you grab the cue ball shifter and gaze over the full round gauge panel -- this is true classic motoring.   ", "  Under the hood is Ford's famous 289 cubic-inch V8, but you already knew that from the moment you looked at those cool valve covers.  What is not quite as easy to see, but you will certainly feel, are the performance upgrades.  This includes a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, MSD coil, and long tube headers.  The motor pulls nicely and makes a sweet rumble out of the dual exhaust.  Best of all you are in complete control over this power and its soundtrack thanks to the four-speed manual transmission.  And so when you drive this one, you'll instantly feel that this sports car is setup to keep you connected to the road.  ", "  Complete with owner's manual, you're looking at a cool, classic fastback Mustang with all the right driver's features.  So if you take the long way to the car show, your pony car is waiting.  But it won't linger here too long, so call today!"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars - La Vergne", "title": "1966 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "", "price": "34995", "kilometers": 728.877, "total_pages": "", "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27246275", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27246275", "year": "1966", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "453 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "4 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

You say, hey let\u00c3\u00a2??s take the long way, which is weird because you are alone. Fifteen minutes later you realize you have been driving in the wrong direction but who cares and the smile on your face will last the rest of the day!
