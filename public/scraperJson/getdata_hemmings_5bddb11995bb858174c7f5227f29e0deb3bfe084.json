Conceived by automotive visionary and then Ford division president Lee Iacocca, the 1965 Mustang took the nation by storm when it debuted. Introduced on April 17, 1964 at the New York world's fair, the Mustang went on to sell over half a million units its first year out of the gate. Meant to be a sporty car for everyone, the Mustang could be optioned from plebeian commuter car all the way up to a 289 ''K code'' factory street racer. Based on a Ford Falcon chassis, and sharing many parts with other FoMoCo passenger cars, the Mustang was a winning combination that was the right car at the right time. This success caught GM and Chrysler corporation off guard, and the Mustang enjoyed two full years of owning the ''Pony Car'' market before GM could get the Camaro and Firebird into production. Now even as the pony car wars rage on today, it is only the Mustang that has been in continuous production for fifty three years, a testament to the legend that was created that first year in 1965. And here we have a fine example of what it was that made buyers from all different walks of life desire to own a piece of the Mustang story. This black beauty is simply gorgeous in its black on black appearance. Up front the dark paint is off set by the shiny chrome bumper and ''GT'' grille with built in amber fog lamps. The white stripe tires on chrome Mustang ''Rally'' wheels exemplify the style of the period. Out back it is all business, with dual exhaust tips exiting from a painted valance under the rear chrome bumper. Inside, this well equipped Mustang features the ''Pony'' interior decor, with embroidered Mustangs on the black vinyl bucket seats. The interior gauges have been replaced with custom sport comp units that add to the sporty flair and a custom center console was added to increase storage and driver comfort.. Under the hood is where the true magic happens, with a 289 V-8 playing a melodic exhaust note that is automotive nirvana. The power from this free revving sweetheart is sent rearward through a sweet shifting three speed automatic transmission with floor shift. This is one super nice, very original and period correct Mustang.

We are family owned, operated, and own our entire inventory, no consignments, and only deal in muscle cars and vintage auto. You can count on us to have 70 to 80 cars at all times. We don't have a big show room that our customers would otherwise pay for. So, that's how we can sell for less than other dealers. To contact us for more information, pictures, or any questions call our office at (865)988-8088 or visit our SmokyMountainTraders website.", "We will start off with the exterior of the Mustang.  When you walk around it the body panels appear to be factory with all the gaps being symmetrical, and the fit of the doors, hood, and trunk are great.  It's covered in the Arcadian Blue Paint that looks to be mostly original.  All the glass looks to be factory along with the window trim.  All the chrome is still very nice, but is showing some age.  To finish off the look it's sitting on a set of 14'' Styled Steel Wheels with Hankook Tires.", "Next, we will look at the interior of the Coupe.  On the inside, it's also done in what appears to be the factory interior.  It has the blue crinkle vinyl with a front bench seat.  The seat covers are older and there's a small tear on the driver side.  Both door panels appear original and are in very good condition.  The headliner is done in the light blue and is also very nice for its age.  Looking at the dash it all appears stock, and the dash lights are working.  The AC is mounted under the dash and is also working.", "Finally, we will look at the driveline of the Ford.  Under the hood it's been upgraded to a 302 Engine that's set up with a Ford Intake and AutoLite Carb.  It's dressed in stock style valve covers and breather.  The engine is mated to a C4 Trans and 8'' Rear End with a 2.80 Gear.  This Mustang has Power Brakes, Power Steering, and Air Condition.  The exhaust flow thru stock manifolds with the stock style exhaust.  When you look under this '65 it appears to be all original floors and frame, there's even still some factory over spray on the floors.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.

The Mustang was smaller, lighter, and more nimble that any American manufacturer had produced thus far. This coupled with its fresh design, the Ford Mustang became a must have among the American public. 1967 marked a pivotal year for the Mustang, as this was the first time since the first generation made its debut that vast changes were made to the Mustang. Making it larger and having many more engine options than before. It also eliminated some things that did not make sense. 1968 was just the same and by this point, Ford had found the next best thing and had very little for competition comparatively.", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this beautiful 1968 Ford Mustang convertible.  It is dressed in diamond blue over a 2 tone blue interior.  The Mustang is powered by a 289 v8 paired with an automatic transmission.  The engine and surrounding area was restored and rebuilt by CD's Engine Service in 2013 and the car comes with receipt to show this.  The engine and under the hood was beautifully painted and shows very well.  The car rides on Hanook tires.  The car has power steering, power convertible top, car cover, spare tire, and center console.  The car was NSRA certified in 2016.  When it comes to cruising in a convertible a Mustang is hard to beat, especially one that fires up and drives like it should!", "To see over 80 photos of this car, including under carriage please visit our website www.grautogallery.com", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.
