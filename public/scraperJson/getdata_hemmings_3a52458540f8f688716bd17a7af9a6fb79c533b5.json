Some struggle to start, others rattle at any slight bump in the road. But when you come across a car, held by a single owner, for any significant amount of time, those examples just feel better in every single way. This Alfa Romeo, not only is a rust free example, has lived in California its entire life, and is a believed to be two owner car. Being sold new in San Jose, CA the car traded hands just once 25 years ago and has resided in the Bay Area. It has always been cared for and that shows from the paint, to the interior, to the excellent mechanical condition. This car never hesitates to start up, and holds and idle like new. The 1300 cc engine is the original unit and it wears its original Solex carburetor mated to the 4 speed transmission. Revving the engine and rowing through the gears is the highlight of this experience but the exterior body styled by Pininfarina holds pace. Seeing an older repaint over 20 years ago the paint shines extremely to this day. There are no cracks or fades. There are only 2 small areas of orange peel that are very hard to notice. The car has obviously always been garaged and it recently saw a light reconditioning thanks to a professional buff, polish, and wax for future protection. All of the exterior chrome and brightwork is in excellent condition. The lights function from the turn indicators to the period correct fog lights. The wheels and hub caps are original and correct to the car. New tires have been fitted for peace of mind. The interior is an excellent place to spend some time. There is nothing cooler than looking over the vintage steering wheel, down the gray hood and chrome hood spear while wrapped in a contrasting red vinyl cocoon. The carpets, door cards, dash, gauges, seats, floor mats, and steering wheel are in excellent condition. When the interior was refreshed years ago the soft top was never re-installed. The original frame will accompany the car while fabric will need to be fitted. This is a testament to the fact that the car was never driven in the ran and has been garage kept. A comforting fact for the serious buyer. The trunk presents very well too and shows no signs of corrosion in to common areas. This is one excellent driving experience and a true opportunity to possess a genuinely solid and highly collectable Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider.", "Additional photographs available upon request.", "Call Max. 208-720-8854"], "Exterior:": "Gray", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "84,907"}},

It's a classic, a 50-year-old design that still looks good today.  The Alfa Romeo \u201cSpider 1600\u201d was introduced to the world on March 10th, 1966. The unofficial name for the first generation of this Italian classic is \u201cDuetto\u201d, implying a small car built for two.  The Duetto was a major change in design for Alfa Romeo, so in 1966 Alfa Romeo chose to hold their cards close to their vest and did not sell the Duetto in the United States. Americans had to wait till 1967 to get their hands on one.  After the Duetto made an appearance in the movie The Graduate it became very popular in the U.S.  This Alfa Romeo was number 700 off the line and you'll be hard pressed to find a Duetto built earlier.  Like the '64 Mustang the Duetto was the start of a line that lasted for decades. This 1966 Alfa Romeo comes with a plethora of options and features that are perfect for any true classic car enthusiast.", "Highlights Of These Features Include:", "New Front Disc Brakes", "New Spark Plugs, Wiring And Timing Adjusted", "Tires With Low Miles", "Wheels Newly Painted", "Radio/Cassette Player", "New Convertible Top", "Hard Top That Fastens In Using The Convertible Connections", "Carpet Is Old But Not Original", "Seats Where In The Car When Purchase But Unsure If They Are Original", "Missing Minor Pieces Of Chrome And The Head Light Covers", "And SO Much More !!!", "This 1966 Alfa Romeo Spider 1966 A.K.A Duetto has never been restored, and has always been very well maintained.
