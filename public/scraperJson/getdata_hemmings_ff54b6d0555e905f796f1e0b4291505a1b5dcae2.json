With distinctive two-tone paint, a beautiful Oyster leather interior, and a modestly upgraded 350 under the hood, it's a great entry-level 'Vette that will get you into all the big events and put a smile on your face every time you crack the throttle.", "1978 was the first year of the fastback styling, and combined with the two-tone paint, the results are a homerun. Wearing an older repaint that still looks decent, this Anniversary 'Vette is perhaps the most handsome built that year. More understated than the pace cars, but emphasizing the bulging fenders, there was no doubt that this was a high performance machine. A lifetime in the warm southern US means that it hasn't had to contend with the elements, and this is a car gets attention simply because of what it is. There's some cosmetic damage on the passenger's side, and while there are the usual signs of age in other spot as well, it doesn't have any immediate needs and you can enjoy it for many years without worries. The price is certainly right and if you don't mind a car that looks like it's got stories to tell, this is a great place to start your Corvette adventure.", "Oyster leather was an unusual choice with the two-tone bodywork, and most enthusiasts prefer it to the much more common silver leather that came on most Anniversary models, as well as the pace car. Wearing bright, clean seat covers, the buckets are supportive and comfortable, and the contrast between the off-white upholstery and silver paint is extremely appealing. The door panels, carpets, and dash pad are also in excellent shape with few signs of use, even on the light-colored carpets. Loaded with options including A/C (needs to be serviced), power windows, and a tilt/telescope column, it's as comfortable as any car you can buy today but infinitely more stylish. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels great in your hands, and someone has added a woodgrain applique kit to the center console, warming up the interior in a big way. An upgraded AM/FM/cassette head unit replaces the original, which probably included an 8-track, and has been neatly installed with no hacking or cutting. In back, the cargo bay is protected by tinted hatch glass and a retracting cargo cover, and you'll note a pair of speakers discreetly tucked into the corners.", "The original, matching-numbers 350 cubic inch V8 is still under the hood, although it has seen its share of upgrades. Those upgrades include a polished Edelbrock intake manifold, a matching Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor, and plenty of chrome dress-up. It's quite clean, with conscientious maintenance and no radical mods to ensure reliability. Underneath, there's a TH350 3-speed automatic transmission, plus a set of 3.08 gears in the original rear end that make it a comfortable highway cruiser. The exhaust system features a high-flow catalytic converter in place of the original, which might free up some horsepower, but it is otherwise quite stock. The undercarriage is very clean even though it's unrestored, suggesting a car that has not seen much in the way of inclement weather. The original machined aluminum wheels wear staggered 255/60/15 front and 275/60/15 rear performance radials that really stuff the fenders.", "Distinctive Corvettes don't have to be expensive and this '78 Anniversary model is a great way to get into the Corvette hobby for not a lot of money.

Of course, it also helps that there has been a solid investment in a professional respray this year.  So the clear coat shine really helps to highlight the curvaceous style of the later C3s.  These have substantially less chrome than the earlier cars, and so the bright white runs uninterrupted from the shark-like nose to the duck tail spoiler \u2013 another great reason to invest in a respray.  But as a true American classic, it doesn't completely skip the bright work.

That's a good thing because the T-tops allow you to open up to the world and let them all see this unbeatable color combo anytime you want. And that's far from the only convenience in this loaded 'Vette.  You also have power windows, power locks, tilt wheel, electric rear defogger, an upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo, and provisions for factory air conditioning.  For the driver, you get a comfortable leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel.  Beyond that is the large speedometer and tachometer package in front, and a full gauge package prominently to the side.  It's everything you want in a true driver's classic.", "Under the hood is the numbers-matching 350 cubic-inch V8.  It feels nice to have the factory motor in this 'Vette considering this is the final year for the legendary St. Louis factory.  Because of the high level of originality, and the fact that this has averaged only around 1,700 miles annually, it makes this affordable Corvette a nice collector's item, too.  Even the three-speed automatic transmission is original to the car.  But more than just its history, this Corvette was meant to drive.  The four-barrel carburetor feed the torque-filled V8, and out on the road, no American classic from this era can beat the Corvette's fully independent suspension. Plus, there have been some nice investments recently in new bushings, shocks, and mufflers to keep its road manners at their best.  Add in power steering, modern low-profile tires, and four-wheel disc brakes, and you have the recipe for the perfect all-around driving classic.", "You're looking at the vintage C3 that comes with a great factory-correct appearance, a good history, and all the right features.

It's an original factory special that seems to sit somewhere between metallic shades of silver and gold \u2013 like a Champagne celebration.  The official Silver Beige name for this hue seems to represent the 1980s perfectly, and it's a unique paint that stands out in public nicely, even when parked among other Corvettes at the car show.  The darker graphics on the lower doors, pin-striping, and hood define some of the Corvette's most dramatic features. The hatchback profile, deep chin spoiler, and duck-tail end cap all add to the distinctive look that was uniquely Corvette.  Besides just looking amazing, this Corvette earns its Special Edition status by being only one of 6,759 commemorative cars built before General Motors shut the books on the C3.", "The interior is arguably more interesting than the exterior.  The metallic leather seat package that was optional on late-C3s is taken one step further with a multi-tone precious metals fade that complements the Silver Beige exterior very well.  A similar pattern on the door panels matches the unique buckets, and everything looks like it was cared for by a true Corvette enthusiast.   It's loaded with options like power windows, power mirrors, tilt steering column, electric rear defrost, an upgraded AM/FM/cassette stereo, and provisions for factory air conditioning.  Tinted glass T-tops means you can have an open-air experience with this Corvette.  Plus, you can store the roof much easier thanks to the glass hatchback. This rear opening is a feature that should have always been on the late C3s, but this special edition was the only car that got it from the factory.", "The 1982 drive train was a preview of the new C4 Corvette.  The Cross Fire fuel-injected 350 cubic-inch V8, was torquey, powerful, and surprisingly efficient thanks to the 700R4 four-speed automatic overdrive transmission as standard equipment.  This is the original motor, and just like the rest of this car, it is refreshingly stock. The offset air cleaner gives it away, but you'll be impressed by how tidy everything is and how well-maintained all the vitals are. It fires up readily, makes a fantastic rumble from the dual exhaust, and snaps through the gears with authority.  And while features like power steering, cruise control, and overdrive make it a fantastic highway cruiser, this classic is always up to release its wild side. After all, the fully-independent sports suspension and four-wheel disc brakes are part of a great package to enjoy the back roads.", "When something this distinct, rare, and fun is also quite affordable, you know you need to hurry to grab this Collector Edition Corvette.

The sweeping curvature of the front fenders, that long hood and the sloping rear windshield combine to create a very distinctive presence.  Its two-tone factory-correct Autumn Red over Dark Claret Metallic paint job shows off that curvature to great effect. Sitting low and level to the ground, it's got a great, agile look \u2013 at the time it was introduced it was one of the most aerodynamic Vettes ever built, with the drag coefficient to prove it. Sporting clean glass and rubber seals everywhere you look, you can readily see it's been well-looked after and, judging by the absence of any spider cracks in the front bumper, has likely spent much of its life indoors when not on the road. The T-top configuration is a great feature \u2013 the T-tops, themselves, surprisingly light and easy to install, while providing the option of enjoying the open-air motoring experience of a convertible should you so choose ... but with substantially less wind noise should you opt for protection from the elements.", "Inside, the code 74 Dark Red leather interior looks exceedingly fresh, with very little evidence of use at all. The bucket seats look plenty supportive, with deep bolsters and relatively high backs to them, and the red carpeting below shows not so much as a heel mark. The distinctive instrumentation in Vettes of this era is truly a thing of beauty \u2013 that assortment of gauges occupying the center console just above the AM/FM/Cassette stereo provides an almost aeronautical look. A lot of Corvettes rolled off the assembly line with a bevy of great options included, but finding those options in good working order more than 35 years later, as is the case here, really is unusual. The A/C system cools with a lot of conviction, the power windows roll up and down without complaint and the tilting/telescoping steering column still moves perfectly. Get out on the highway and you'll find that the cruise control also performs its duties as precisely as when the first mile was logged.", "Underneath that long hood, the same 350V8 this Vette started life with in Bowling Green, Kentucky sits in a clean and stock engine compartment and it seems to have thoroughly vanquished time, still running very smoothly and quietly. It's mated with a 3-speed automatic transmission that was right there with it from the beginning and shifts smoothly. Take this Sting Ray's relatively light weight, then factor in power disc brakes at all four corners, and you have a performance vehicle that stops just as well as it accelerates.
