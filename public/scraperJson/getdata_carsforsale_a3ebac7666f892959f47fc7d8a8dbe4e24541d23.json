We will describe the truck inside and out.\u00c2\u00a0A beautiful deep dark purple color with lots of pearl. The paint is so deep that you can see your reflection in it. The truck is painted inside and out. The inside of the cab, doors, jambs, dash and interior are all the same dark purple. The inside of the bed is painted to match. The exhaust on the truck looks great it is custom as well. The exhaust comes out just above the rear bumper and towards the back. The bed is custom as well. The chrome strips accent and highlight the depth in the wood. The wood in the bed is an exotic wood known as Purple Heart. The wood is custom cut and finished to put into the truck.The interior of the truck as been finished in grey and black highlights. The seat is new along with the rest of the interior. The dash looks great as well as the custom gauges. The glass is all new. The door glass has been converted to a one piece glass with a nice kit from the Truck Shop. The truck does not have a heater or ac. crate motor 400 along with an automatic 400 transmission. The motor and transmission run and sound great. The motor puts down enough power to light the tires up and it still runs very cool. The aluminum four core radiator ensure that the truck runs nice and cool. The front end is off a Chevy Camaro and the rear-end is a Chevy rear end with 3.73 posi-traction rear-end. The lug bolt pattern is all the same around the truck (5 x 4 3/4). The battery is relocated to the bottom of the bed. Also the disc brake booster has been relocated.

Take this 1936 Chevy Master Deluxe 2-door sedan for example: lots of room, a decent trunk, and still carrying all the upgrades you'd want in your next rod. And contrary to what you've been taught, some sedans look downright awesome when given the full treatment.  ", "  Sleek and aerodynamic, this Master Deluxe was the top-of-the-line Chevy in '36 and shows off its Art-Deco influences throughout, a look that hasn't gone out of style and probably never will. Finished in original red steel with traditional glass black fenders and running boards, it's likely not this car's original color combination but it does look right. The body is 100% GM steel (sans fenders/boards) to capture the full-look, although there are a few flourishes here and there, from the custom rear bumpers framing the faired-in license plate to the late-model Cadillac taillights frenched into the rear deck to the shaved front bumper. Fit and finish are quite good, and the doors close with that distinctive sound that only vintage cars demonstrate. Most of the original trim's still in place, too, including the lovely waterfall grille, hood trim, and scrolled door handles that look like miniature works of art, even on a Chevy. Tinted glass all around makes it comfortable inside and updates the look, and even the running boards are trimmed properly so they're still usable as intended.  ", "  The interior sticks with traditional hot-rodding style, offering gray tweed upholstery, bucket seats up front, and the original bench in back. More tweed covers the door panels and dash, offering a vintage-looking pattern that's neither too ornate nor too plain, and it all remains in outstanding condition thanks to tweed's tendency to wear like iron. The original dash has been dressed up with a billet gauge panel full of white-faced gauges from Classic Instruments and a molded in Chevy Bowtie emblem in the center. A leather-wrapped steering wheel on a tilt column looks awesome, and for entertainment, there's a JVC AM/FM/CD stereo tucked under the dash. The trunk is big enough to carry a surprising amount of luggage on your next road trip, and is fully upholstered so you won't be embarrassed when it's time to unload your gear. There's even a space-saver spare, just in case.  ", "  The most critical ingredient in any rod is the powertrain, and this Chevy delivers with a 350 cubic inch V8 that has been neatly wedged between the flowing front fenders. Topped by an aluminum mid-rise Edelbrock intake and a big Holley carburetor, it gives this vintage sedan the moves of a muscle car. It's also neatly dressed with plenty of chrome, a trick air cleaner, and contrasting red plug wires that add some flash. A big Walker radiator keeps things cool and that big cool can on the firewall looks a lot like a vintage oil filter. Underneath you'll find a Mustang II front suspension with rack-and-pinion ste"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1936 Chevrolet Master Deluxe ", "total_results": "1156 .

", "  From the moment you lay eyes on this one you can tell it's an interesting custom build.  But before we dive into the investments that make it quite original, let's remember why this is such a great classic to begin with.  Detroit was happy to awaken after WWII with plenty of stylized cars.  This meant providing new ideas with interesting curvaceous bodies.  And of course, there was chrome, too.  On this 210 model brightwork surrounds every piece of glass, runs the full length of the side, outlines the lower rear fender, covers both bumpers, surrounds every exterior light, and gives the car a shiny toothy grille. All of this makes this classic so distinctive today, and it's highlighted exceptionally well thanks to a modern bright red canvas.  And that's exactly how to view this classic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the perfect blend of vintage and new worlds.  That's why this classic silhouette has more modern custom touches like the shaved trim and Cragar wheels.  ", "  Inside it also seamlessly blends the vintage and new worlds together.  After all, you can immediately tell by the quality of the cloth seats, door panels, carpeting, and headliner that there has been a solid investment in updating the materials while retaining a factory-style look.  And while the artful two-spoke steering wheel looks factory, you also can instantly see this is far from just a period-correct interior.  After all, the full set of Dolphin gauges keeps you far better informed that the original readouts.  And the modern R134a air conditioning is the perfect feature to make you want to cruise this classic everywhere...And that's far from the only long-haul comfort feature.  ", "  You'll love lifting the hood thanks to all of this bright elements (air topper, valve covers, pulleys, etc.) radiating from within the red engine bay.  And backing up this hot appearance is a 283 cubic-inch small block \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice upgrade considering this was the era of the Blue Flame six.  And you get to hear the growl of the V8 better with the glasspack-style dual exhaust.  You're going to love taking this classic out on the road thanks to enhancements like the upgraded independent front suspension with thick sway bar.  Plus, the transmission has been upgraded to a four-speed unit with highway-friendly overdrive. There are even front disc brakes. So if this looks like a great anywhere/anytime cruiser, you'd be absolutely right!
