Many cars are known from starring roles on TV or in the movies - but few are as well-known as the DeLorean DMC-12 - the car that took Michael J. Fox \"Back to the Future\" in 3 feature films.  Built from 1981-1982, the DMC-12 was the brainchild of former GM executive John Z. De Lorean.  It was styled by Italian stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro and the chassis was suspension engineered by Colin Chapman, founder and owner of Lotus Cars.  About 9,200 DMC-12s were produced between January 1981 and December 1982.  In 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean Motor cars were believed still to exist.  This vehicle has a clean CarFax report and has known ownership from 10/22/1991.  It is  a 3-owner car (the last two owners were physicians, both located in the midwest - Ohio and Indiana).  This vehicle was driven sparingly by the most recent owner, and registered for road use every year since 06/20/1998 - the most recent registration renewal was 10/17/2016.  Wanting for more power sometime in 1987, the second owner installed a twin-turbo kit manufactured by Tom Dieckhoff of Turbo Manifold Co. in Wheatley Heights, NY.  Twin IHI RHB5 turbos, a new throttle body and exhaust manifolds and mufflers, and a list of other parts breathed new life into the underpowered factory Peugeot-Renault-Volvo sourced 2.85L V6.  The kit is exceptionally well made and is integrated so well into the engine bay it could easily have been factory designed and installed.  This DeLorean just received a complete inspection and service at a cost of over $6,000.00., incl. flush of all fluids and change of all filters, fuel pump relay, complete brake system refurbishment incl. new master cylinder and brake lines, new calipers, new pads and machined rotors.  The updated stainless steel coolant reservoir was installed, as well a new water pump and all gaskets for the intake manifold.  A fuel system treatment was added to clean injectors, valves, throttle body and intake manifold.  New hood and passenger door struts were also installed at this time. It runs and drives very well and the body and interior are in excellent condition, with no signs of accident damage or repair.  The DMC-12 was only available with two factory options; a no-cost manual transmission and the choice of a grey or black interior.  This example also has some dealer installed options, including floor mats, headlight covers and black textured door accent stripes.  It comes with all books and manuals, a workshop manual and service and ownership history.  It is rare to find an example in this condition and with the low original mileage - not to mention the increase in performance from the very rare twin-turbo system.  During the last few years DeLoreans have experienced a bottoming out of values and now are on the rise as investment grade collectibles!  This example is very reasonably priced at $39,900.00 / obo.", "Call or text Brian @ (812) 760-5513 - Evansville, IN 47715."], "Exterior:": "Silver SS", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "37600"}},

Always ambitious and willing to try new things, the talented salesman and engineer was planning to go his own way with a new sports car, one that would be more technically advanced and have superior safety features. He called it the ethical sports car-for the bachelor who's made it. Built in Northern Ireland, under an agreement with the British Government, the DMC-12 was styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro of Italdesign.It featured distinctive gullwing doors and outer body panels of brushed stainless steel over a rear-engined, Renault-powered chassis and suspension that was largely based upon the Lotus Esprit. Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus, was then brought in to resolve any engineering issues. The first 500 production DeLoreans were ready for shipment in April 1981 and, at first, the model was a huge success, mainly due to its founder's fame and innovative design. Unfortunately, the success cooled quickly and the DeLorean Motor Company filed for bankruptcy in late 1982. Some 9,200 DeLoreans had been built with approximately 6,500 still in existence worldwide today.This wonderful example was imported from New York in 2016 with all taxes paid. Present with fabulous grey leather interior that is exemplary and unblemished as is the brushed steel bodywork. With only two owners from new, this DeLorean has covered a mere 9,889 miles from new , a point that is reflected in the car's condition. With its Gullwing doors open, it certainly looks as futuristic today as it did in 1981. Surely, without doubt, this must be one of the finest examples of this extraordinary car on the market today and would not look out of place in private collection or museum.A?", "Auction"], "Mileage:": "9889"}}
