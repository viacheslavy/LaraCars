Road racing has long been a part of American car culture for not only showing what companies could do but just for the sheer fun. The 60\"??s and 70\"??s would see one of the biggest booms in the sport with Lemans and the T/A series finding plenty of fans. The sport would eventually fade away after Car manufactures began to focus on fuel economy and safety instead of performance. This example is true to that heritage and was built to look and perform as such. Probably the first thing you notice on this 71 is the headlights. Like racecars of that time the hole light assembly ahs been removed with a Lemans style piece put in its place that not only looks sportier but shaves quite a few ponds off. The front has a bottom spoiler to help with down force but you have to admit looks pretty darn good. The paint job is fitting with the company logos being nothing more than vinyl decals that can be removed if you don\"??t like the look. The racing components is what really separates this road course weapon from the rest. The Bilstein shocks are race ready with the tubular control arms fiberglass leaf springs and lowered stance all add to the carving capability\"??s. The Steeroids rack and pinion steering is one of the most precise setups sold for these cars eliminating any of the see saw motion in the wheel. Under the L88 hood is a 383 stroker motor from GM\"??s very successful ZZ line. The huge cam and a great tune has this small block pumping out A massive 500+HP. The tremec 5 speed handles the power nicely with the built rear end having 650HP half shafts. The 3.55 gears give the perfect mix of acceleration and top end grunt. The bucket seats inside are exactly what you need if you are thinking about trying to use the car to its full potential. The 4-point cage adds rigidity to the chassis while giving a level of protection with the 4-point harness\"?? keep you in place. The dash on the car has been taken out with a more race car friendly layout taking its place. The removable steering wheel allows for more room when getting in and out of the car and another item that you would expect to see in a car of this nature. The 200MPH speedometer as well as an MSD REV limiter that even has a 2 step. If you have been wanting a race car that can be driven to the track run some hot laps around the road course and then driven back home in confidence this 71 Corvette fits the bill. Options on this 1971 Corvette include Power Windows Power Brakes Cloth Interior Seat Belts T Tops and Radial Tires with Alloy Wheels.

The Vette was every school boys dream in the day being the ultimate \u201cMacho Man\u201d car, complete with the L82 power plant!", "This particular example, like all '54 through '81 Vettes, was made in GM's St. Louis, Missouri assembly plant. It has since been enhanced with an Eckler turbo-designed body package with International Motor Sport Association (IMSA) body flares and NACA ducts in front and a louvered backlight. The paint and trim are in overall excellent condition, as are the glass panels, including the rear window with electric defroster. There are some spider cracks in the paint upon very close inspection but overall very hard to detect. The car's lights are very good order with the factory, round pop-up headlights replaced by recessed quad rectangular units covered by transparent plexiglass.", "This \u2018Vette rolls on BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires, size P255/60R15 in front and P275/60R15 in back and each radial surrounds a Tru-Spoke wire wheel with center spinners. The tires and wheels are in very good condition.", "The car's bodywork is straight and solid; including the silver reflective glass T-tops. Ralph Eckler began as a one-man body shop in Rock Island, Illinois in 1961. Eleven years later, he published his first catalog, offering fiberglass and other Corvette body parts. The engine bay is very tidy, the battery appears new, the cargo area behind the bucket seats is in good order and the car's bumpers fit well to the rest of the body.", "Under the hood is a naturally aspirated 350 CID V-8 with electronic ignition that breathes through dual side-exit exhausts and is hooked to a Turbo Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic transmission and back by a 3.55:1 rear end. Driver convenience features include air-conditioning, cruise control, power steering, power four-wheel disc brakes, and power windows.", "Inside, the car's red interior is eye-popping. Pair of red Royce Limited red bucket seats replaced the factory seats and are in overall very good order. The matching red carpeting is in very good shape, too, while the red instrument panel, with its full instrumentation, three-spoke steering wheel, red inner door panels, mirror glass, center console and shift lever with wood handle are all in good order. Completing the interior is a factory AM/FM stereo with cassette deck.", "This vehicle was featured in a 1983 issue of Custom Rodder magazine.", "Nineteen seventy-eight was the Corvette's 25th Anniversary and all 78s featured silver anniversary nose and fuel door emblems. A new fastback rear window was the most dramatic and noticeable styling change, giving the 10-year-old C3 Corvette body style a fresh lease on life. The fixed-glass fastback benefited both aerodynamics and increased the usable luggage space behind the seats while improving rearward visibility in the bargain. The tachometer and speedometer were redesigned to match the new \u201caircraft styled\u201d center console and gauge cluster first seen the previous year. Redesigned interior door panels were also new as well as an actual glove box was added in front of the passenger seat, replacing the map pockets of previous years.", "Available options now included power door locks, a power antenna, dual rear speakers and a CB radio. The optional convenience group, introduced the previous year, now included intermittent (delay) wipers, floor mats, and the passenger side vanity mirror was an upgraded illuminated unit.  The more desirable L82 engines were also now fitted with an aluminum intake manifold, which saved 24 pounds compared to the cast iron unit of previous years. The Corvette converted to metric tires with the P225/70R15 as standard. Wider P255/60R15 tires were available as an option and required fender trimming from the factory for clearance. The fuel tank capacity increased from 17 to 24 gallons on all cars. To make room for the larger tank, a smaller (P195/80D15) space saver spare tire was utilized.", "Competition to this Corvette in 1978 included the Avanti II, Datsun's 280Z, Jaguar's XJ-S, Mazda's RX-7, Mercedes-Benz's 450SL and Porsche's 911.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.
