A major redesign in 1978 moved the Bronco to a larger size, using a shortened Ford F-Series truck chassis to compete with both the similarly adapted Chevy K5 Blazer, as well as the Dodge Ramcharger. Most Broncos are usually equipped with a Spare tire swing away carrier found on the outside of the rear end door. From 1966 to 1986 Broncos were produced at Ford's Michigan Truck Plant in Wayne, Michigan.
