But for the few who don't see the paint, the wheels, or any of the other new aggressive touches, the race-ready 428 Cobra Jet V8 will teach them a lesson to take notice.", "This could play the villain in any movie.  The deep black paint on this coupe seems to absorb the sunlight.  It's that kind of bad attitude and hard shine that will instantly get it recognized and remembered.  The reason why this one is so well done is because the paint and body had the kind of money spent on it that people use for this whole restoration.  We have receipts from Cobra Automotive Inc for over $20k in just the paint and body work... and this huge investment shows! Ford never made a body so straight, and so this rare fastback has the kind of creases that look like they could give you a paper cut.  While the car is butter smooth, there is a grit to its attitude that tells you it eats its ''secretary's car'' siblings for breakfast.  You see it in the wide hood scoop, blacked-out front end, hood pins, and blacked-out rear panel with smoked taillights.  The black torque thrust wheels continue this dark attitude while also adding some Bullitt-level flair.", "Inside there's nothing to get in the way of performance driving. The rear seats have been removed to save weight (comes with sale) and make way for the roll cage.  The front seats are now modern ProCar racing buckets with Simpson five-point harnesses.  Any coddling feature that would add weight has been replaced with race-ready toggle switches.  As the driver, you get the grippy sports steering wheel mounted on a Flaming River tilt column.  Beyond that is a full set of AutoMeter that look cool, but more importantly, give a precise readout about what's going on in this performance machine. To complete this go-fast interior, there's a Hurst shifter and a huge AutoMeter tach (after all \u2013 you're watching your revs the most in the quarter miles.)", "Because people are going to want to peek under the hood, the monster motor looks terrific.  Then again, it's kind of hard not to look great with all the right hardware radiating power from within the dark engine bay.  You're looking at a 428 cubic-inch Keith Craft Racing Cobra Jet V8.  It was assembled by Pierce Racing in Huntersville, NC.  The fortified construction includes a fully machined and prepped block, ARP main studs, FelPro seals, balanced & polished crank, Federal Mogul rod bearings, Ford Racing timing set, Comp Cams hydraulic roller cam with roller rockers, FMC pistons & rings, and aluminum heads built by DSC Motorsports.  Plus, it has the right go-fast upgrades like a Holley AED 750 four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock Performer intake, MSD ignition, and hand-crafted NASCAR-style headers.  There is a ton more to this monster motor's investment, but we don't have the room to list it here \u2013 so call us for all the details.  For now, just know the moment you fire this one up, it has the kind of thunder that makes lesser cars cower away.  Handling all this huge horsepower and neck-snapping torque is a Tremec TKO600 five-speed manual transmission that was specially built by AMP Performance ($3,500 receipt) to go with the upgraded motor.  This feeds the Ford 9'' Detroit Locker rear end with strong Moser 35 spline axles.  A build this intense also requires the right suspension upgrades.  That's why you have a TCI Mustang II-style independent front suspension, reinforced frame, and TCI three-link rear.  Plus, adjustable coilovers, Bilstein shocks, and a full Wilwood four-wheel disc brake package are all part of this fully-built Mustang.", "Complete with build receipts and restoration photos, this is the classic that's not for the faint of heart or the Sunday driver.  But if you're looking for the ultimate street villain to give everyone else nightmares, this classic Mustang is the dark horse of your dreams."], "Exterior:": "Black", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "128"}},

A fuel injected 428 Super Cobra Jet sits under the hood that will tear up most anything that will pull up next to it. Made famous from the Nicholas Cage move \"??Gone in 60 Seconds\"?\u009d the Eleanor Mustang has rocketed to being one of the most famous movie cars ever produced. Featuring aftermarket ground effects and smoother lines that were to die for consumers wanted to have their own Eleanor parked in their garages. This Eleanor kit was made using the same molds that were used on the real movie cars and were meticulously installed. Everywhere you look on this car it is sure to grab your attention from the velocity stacks on top of the 428 to the performance suspension underneath. The fuel injected Super Cobra Jet pumps out plenty of power and paired with the Tremec 5-Speed manual transmission this car will cruise any where you decide to take it with ease. The suspension is firm yet forgiving and is capable of putting down serious lap times then driving home in style and comfort. The interior still carries much of the same look as when it came from the factory from the stock dash to the wood grained steering wheel. As you look closely at the details though it becomes apparent this is not your stock Mustang interior. The Carroll Shelby gauges provide a high performance feel while giving much more accurate readings. The embroidered seats provide both the driver and passenger with plenty of support and will keep you planted in the seat while flying around corners; and who wouldn\"??t notice the roll bar running right behind the rear seats!? This Mustang Eleanor is not only a tribute to an American icon but it may just be the ultimate driving machine! This vehicle is located in our Denver showroom.

When Jerry Bruckheimer decided to remake the car chase laden movie 'Gone In 60 Seconds' in 2000, he probably didn't suspect that he would start an automotive trend that continues to this day. The real star of the film turned out to be a modified 1967 Shelby GT500 tribute called 'Eleanor'. Mean-looking 1967 Mustang Sportsroofs have been roaming our highways ever since. What sets this '67 Eleanor apart is lurking just under the surface. The foundation for the amazing powerplant is a Ford Racing Boss 351 block with 4-bolt main bearings. A steel 427 stroker crankshaft, as well as internally balanced forged connecting rods and pistons, ensure that the bottom end is more than rock-solid. Additional goodies under the hood include AFR 180 aluminum cylinder heads, a Competition Cams roller cam (35-312-8) with pushrods and rocker arms, Ford Racing roller lifters, Canton 7qt. oil pan, Fluidyne aluminum radiator, a FAST fuel injection system paired with an Edelbrock Victor intake manifold with 62lb. injectors, and last, but certainly not least, a Paxton Novi 2000 centrifugal supercharger. The prodigious power is routed through a TKO 600 5-speed manual transmission with a SPEC stage 3 clutch and Modern Driveline clutch kit, then back to a Ford 9'' rear end with Traction-Lok and 3.50 gears. The chassis has been upgraded with a TCI front subframe kit with coilover front shocks, tubular A-arms, and rack and pinion steering. A Scott Drake power brake booster and master cylinder supply pressure for the the Wilwood 4-wheel disc brake system through Wilwood stainless steel brake lines and a Wilwood adjustable proportioning valve. The Aeroform Eleanor body kit from Scott Drake is covered in a beautiful shade of PPG Navy Blue paint, while the interior benefits from the addition of Autometer Phantom gauges and an Old Air Products electronic air conditioning system.
