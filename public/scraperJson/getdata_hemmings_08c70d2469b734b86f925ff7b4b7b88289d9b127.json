But this 1967 Ford Mustang is so original, we even believe the A-code V8 is from the factory.  So you're looking at a standout coupe for quite a nice price.", "Burnt Amber is this Mustang's original color, and today the hue represents 1967 perfectly.  This sets up for a head-turning appearance because so many of these Mustangs have traded in their roots for wild new colors.  But this one goes in the opposite direction, and in fact, it's believed to be the original paint that the San Jose factory applied in January 1967.  That's what makes this one so exciting.  The presentation is not perfect, but don't be surprised if this is the one to draw the true enthusiasts at events.  After all, while many pony cars have gone through plenty of changes over the decades, this one has a half-century under good care that has kept this coupe complete, bright, and exceptionally straight \u2013 right down to the styled steel wheels with the Mustang logo in the middle.", "One of the best colors to go with the golden hue exterior is the parchment interior.  Just like the exterior, we're hard pressed to find anything that didn't come directly from the factory.  Careful maintenance means the seats, dash, and door panels remain complete.  The right details are still in place like the deluxe steering wheel; the heat/defrost sliders still work; and even the factory AM radio is still cranking out tunes.  The revised '67 gauge panel still shows large and clear readouts, so this survivor is also easy to enjoy out on the road.", "Lift hood for more great originality.  It's a correct 289 cubic-inch V8 that has resisted any shiny add-ons.  Instead, you get the correct bold blue presentation of the block, valve covers, and air topper.  While the preserved presentation means most people will never even have to ask if its original, the date code on this V8 puts it so close that it's hard to imagine any other V8 ever being in this engine bay.  Plus, this one has the optional and desirable A-code 289, and it still wears a Holley four-barrel carb today! Because this is a cared for survivor, the V8 fires up easily and feels smooth out on the road.

But more than just a rare coupe that started a revolution, this one also has only averaged around 700 miles annually and it's believed to have its original F-code V8.  So read all the detail, but just know you're not the only enthusiast that's already excited.", "Ford had a huge hit on its hands with the first-generation Mustang.  It was an instant icon, and so when looking for the ultimate classic, you want the earliest example you can get that has both originality and rarity.  That's what makes this one so appealing.  Dynasty Green is a great way to represent the first run of the original pony car.  After all, this was a color that was phased out after '65.  And while many of these cars have traded it in for a more mainstream red or black, this one gets more distinctive every year that it retains its factory-correct hue.  You can tell this coupe has received the right care and investment over the years.  That's why the bumpers and taillight bezels keep it shining at their best.  Yes, the American Racing wheels are an upgrade in flair.  So while the original ones come with the sale, too, we think when you're the coupe that launched the pony car revolution you deserve to show off a little.", "Inside, the black vinyl is always a great interior to have, and this one shows high degrees of originality.  That means it's far from perfect, but it does certainly take a level care to still be this complete after over a half-century on this earth.  Bucket seats and a sporty three-spoke steering wheel are the great things that made you and the rest of American fall in love with the Mustang.  Even the AM radio is still cranking out tunes! But more than nostalgia, this one has some great features that collectors really look for.  For example, the center console is a great way to showcase a bright and premium interior.  And have you noticed that this 1964.5 even has the ultra-desirable Rally-Pac?", "When you open the hood, the bold blue valve covers and air topper grab your attention, but it's what's beneath them that's really special.  This is an F-code Mustang, which means it came from the factory with a 260 cubic-inch V8... and that's the block that's still under the hood today!  The 4/1/64 date coded block is believed to be original to the coupe, and original-style presentation certainly looks the part of correctness.  Once the 1964.5 production switched over to 1965, this option was gone.  So it's a cool piece of original history to have this still under the hood.  The same goes for the generator.  After all, it could easily be switched to an alternator, but it has been kept in this one all these years because Mustang people know to look for this special short-run component.  And with features like the power steering and the three-speed automatic transmission, you can comfortably drive this benchmark classic to all the shows you want.", "You're looking at an in-demand piece of automotive history.

If you're reading this, then this high-visibility 1965 Ford Mustang coupe didn't sell immediately upon arrival, which has about a 50% chance of happening each time a new pony shows up. If there's one car you can bank on, it's the Ford Mustang.", "You can't go wrong with bright colors and this one wears a coat of brilliant yellow paint, which sure gives this coupe a look that gets noticed. We like it when early Mustangs are honest, and this one doesn't need stripes, scoops, or wings to stand out, instead relying on the famous Mustang look that's one of the most beloved in the entire automotive world. Workmanship is pretty good, and starting with a good southern car never hurts, although the finish does have some signs of use and most of the trim is original. The quarters are straight and clean, the doors fit well, and details stand out against the shiny paint. Check out the sharp crease that frames the side cove, the chrome insert, and the shiny chrome bumpers that glitter. The '65s had a cross-hair emblem in the grille, so they're easy to spot and this is a real C-code car, so the '289' emblems on the front fenders were earned the right way.", "The Mustang's interior looks great in any form, and the recent black Pony upholstery looks dressy when combined with that bright yellow paint. It looks like most of the interior soft parts are recent, including the seat covers, carpets, and door panels, and they all match the factory stuff exactly. The original dash carries factory instruments including the original wide speedometer with bright markings, and the knobs and handles are in good shape. The floor-mounted automatic shifter reminds you that the Mustang could be configured just about any way a customer wanted, so this one is dressed up without being over-done. There is no radio, but that means it's ripe for an upgrade and the dash hasn't been hacked up, so it will be easy to make it look right. The trunk carries a correct mat, spare tire, and a matching tire cover.", "This is a real C-code car, and the 289 cubic inch V8 under the hood sticks to the original formula. That means a 2-barrel carburetor, a smooth, torquey idle, and Ford Blue paint on the engine and valve covers. The only notable deviations from stock include the open-element air cleaner and a power dual reservoir master cylinder on the firewall, which works in conjunction with front disc brakes, a nice upgrade. The C4 3-speed automatic is quick-witted enough to be a great dance partner when the road starts to twist and the door tag says it carries 2.80 gears, making this a great highway cruiser. It has also been upgraded with a mellow-sounding dual exhaust system, so it sounds like a Mustang should sound without getting too aggressive around town. Magnum 500 wheels look great on vintage Mustangs and wear recent 15-inch blackwall radials for a no-nonsense look.", "So if history's any indicator, the clock is ticking on this nicely turned-out Mustang. If you're interested, you really need to call today!"], "Exterior:": "Yellow", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "9447"}},
