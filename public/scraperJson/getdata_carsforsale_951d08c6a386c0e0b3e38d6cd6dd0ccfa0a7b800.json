The car comes complete with both the soft convertible top and the optional factory hardtop. This 280SL represents the final evolution of the model series that was originally introduced in 1963 and produced through final model-year 1971. Referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pagoda\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Mercedes-Benz, this moniker was taken from the inverted roof shape of the hardtop. This Mercedes is really the ideal choice for an investment-grade classic car. The classic body lines have gracefully aged with time and arguably present better today than ever before, the 2.8L single overhead-cam fuel-injected inline-6 engine has a legendary reputation for both reliability and longevity, and there is an active manufacturer-supported parts-availability program. Mercedes-Benz was a forward-thinking company and was one of the first to integrate safety engineering into its cars. The central cabin area is structurally reinforced to protect the occupants with front and rear \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crush zones\u00e2\u20ac\u009d designed to absorb impact in the event of a crash. The 280SL was intended for grand touring with an emphasis on creature comfort combined with sharp cornering capability; hence, the majority of USA-specification cars came equipped with automatic transmission, air conditioning and power steering. The suspension dynamics of the 280SL is exemplary with 4-wheel independent suspension and the 4-wheel disc brake system ensures world-class stopping power. This is a classic car that you can drive and enjoy with no compromise to comfort, safety or performance. This 280SL presents beautifully in the factory-correct color DB050 White, complemented by a dark-bamboo leather interior with the classic MB-Tex grain and finish. Everything works perfectly and there are no rattles, squeaks or issues. Starts right up and settles into a smooth quiet idle. Fine examples are becoming harder to find and these are constantly appreciating in value.

"description": ["Shown by Appointment ONLY, please contact Ray at 949.395.2339    Stunning Silver on Black with Sunroof, Power windows, Auto on column, A/C    Car was ground up restored by Sheldon Restorations in Costa Mesa, California (formerly the facility for Bruce Strauss, world renowned restorer/collector).   At the height of the recession in 2009-2011, Mr. Sheldon decided to sell his huge business and move back to South Africa.  This was a car he was restoring for himself and his son who ran the business, so trust me, no short cuts taken.  Bruce Strauss stated that this car, once finished would easily fetch $80-$100K and that was in 2012!  We all know what his Olive green 280SE 3.5L Cabriolet has done \u00ef\u0081\u0160  A car I should have bought when Bruce was asking $130K in late 1990's, and now pushing over $400K!!!  Please take a look at Hagerty values which have taken a sharp upward turn on 6-cyl 280SE's, both low and high grills.  We expect this to continue it's sharp increase as the 3.5's are becoming less and less affordable, it makes the 6-Cyl's a bargain, as we've witnessed the Gullwings and Roadsters of 1950's prices, and their more affordable version, the 190SL's taking a steep rise in their prices.      All mechanicals were gone thru, expansive cosmetic restoration to the level of Pebble Beach.  Bare metal Paint job with an empty shell, new rubber, new chrome, new window moldings/channels, all new interior with the black headliner, glossy black dash.   We went thru the engine, injection pump, fuel tank, exhaust, brake system, radiator, brake lines, A/C flush and recharged, Electrical system, door panels, upholstery, heater levers, fuel injection pump, radiator flush, brake/transmission fluids, parts for the shifter lever, dash lighting, restoration of the wood in glossy black by Madera Concepts in Santa Barbara, California, all new chrome/rubber, Electronic sunroof, power windows, and the list just goes on and on. Car was purchased from Mr. Sheldon in 2010 and brought to completion by the efforts of Tony Wahl at Tony's German Auto and his knowledgeable wife, Linda.  Tony is considered by many the most respected Classic MBZ mechanic in the country if not in the world.   Some 40 years+ of experience on ONLY classical Mercedes benz has taken to make him on of the greatest master mechanics in the world.  Tony supervised the entire completion job which took over one  year.  There are just too many items to list here.  Parts were purchased from various sources including MBZ Classic Center, Sun Valley MBZ, Miller's, as well as some custom fabrication on some metal parts which did not exist at an astronomical rates.  There's nothing cheap about restoring a 1960's-1970's Mercedes Benz.  By the same token, I don't feel that Hagerty prices are a good justification.  When people ask me that the value on Hagerty is only XXX Amount of dollars, far below what it takes realistically to do this type of project, my answer is simple:  Please go to Hagerty Headquarters and I'm certain they have at least 10 of these cars lined up at their prices.

So to have the opportunity at one means a rare chance at joining the upper echelon of classic cars.  ", "  Mercedes takes great pride in their SL line.  In fact, the W113 Pagoda cars were largely hand-built in Germany.  This gave each one a level of fit and finish that made them collector's cars from day one.  There're also exceptionally durable and meticulous to restore.  That's why it's so nice to find one that has been given the proper investment in care and restoration.  This includes an application of a Silver Gray metallic paint that has such a fantastic shine that it has you dreaming about sunny-day cruises.  You will find plenty of other cases on this car were no expense was spared keeping the brightwork radiant and the body panels masterfully aligned.  So yes, this is an opportunity to purchase a classic that has been cared for the same way you would have if you owned it since new.  ", "  The Pagoda-style hardtop roof gives this SL its namesake, and it also gives it a dignified coupe-like appearance.  Still, you can remove the hardtop for any time you feel like having the wind whip through the cabin.  In fact, it's hard not to want to share the restored bright red interior with the world.  And with the air conditioning blowing ice-cold, what's stopping you? Mercedes over-engineered their cars to be exceptionally durable, and that tradition continues with a substantial investment in the interior.  The doors close with a solid and confident precision; the new leather seats strike the perfect balance between durable and all-day comfortable; the new and correct VDO gauges have military-grade precision; and the steering wheel and gearbox have an intricate design but a hardy feeling in your hands.  This is classic car motoring that inspires confidence from the driver's seat.  ", "  The key to the idea that Mercedes-Benz cars are bulletproof comes from the reputation built during the 280 SL's era.  Mercedes made only a few variations of motors in '69, which means they were able to take the time to get the engineering exactly right.  Today that gives cars like this 280 SL a large and reliable parts network that even still includes Mercedes-Benz.  A robust and well maintained powerplant also means the fuel-injected 2.8-liter inline-six under the hood is exceptionally smooth and is durable enough that you can drive it like a true performance machine.  Yes, you can shift the gated four-speed automatic on your own if you desire, and the motor can take the high rev range with ease.  But really this is a grand touring Mercedes.  This car is about utilizing the ample trunk space to pack weekend bags and enjoy the backroads to your destination.  With power steering, a well-balanced suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes, this is truly classic car motoring at its finest.

"mileage": "102747", "description": ["The Mercedes-Benz W114 and W115 models are a series of sedans and coup\u00e9s introduced in 1968 by Mercedes-Benz, manufactured through model year 1976, and distinguished in the marketplace by names relating to their engine size. W114 models featured six-cylinder engines and were marketed as the 230, 250, and 280, while W115 models featured four-cylinder engines and were marketed as the 200, 220, 230, and 240. All were styled by Paul Bracq, featuring a three-box design. At the time, Mercedes marketed sedans in two size classes, with the W114/W115, positioned below the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Beginning in 1968, Mercedes marketed their model range as New Generation Models, giving their ID plates the designation '/8' (due to their 1968 Launch year). Because they were the only truly new cars of the so-called 'New Generation' and because of the '/8' or 'slash eight' designation, W114 and W115 models ultimately received the German nickname Strich Acht, loosely translated into the English Stroke eight.", "The W114 also boasted advanced technological innovations. 1969 saw the introduction of the Bosch D-jetronic fully electronic fuel injection system into the 250CE. This was the first ever production Mercedes-Benz to use this system. Other innovations in the W114/W115 models include a center console (a first in a Mercedes sedan), ribbed taillights in 1974. All coup\u00e9 models used the 6-cylinder engine (and thus were W114s) and were designated with a \"C\" in the model name.", "This exceptionally nice example is very rare stateside with a Manual gearbox as most US market cars were fitted with an automatic. The car has subsequently had a ZF 5 Speed installed- the correct unit fitted to later model cars in Europe, making it even more fun to drive. Additionally, this car is a driver's car with Fully independent suspension- the previous models had a swing axle rear end, 4 wheel disc brakes, Front and rear sway bars, Wider body, with subtle curves of the body and window glass, a very good fresh air vent system thru the headliner that vents into the low pressure area just to the back of the rear doors. and of course the design of the 230 motor was pirated by Datsun to power their D240 sports car.", "The car has had an new leather interior installed and has been mechanically restored. Featuring Air Conditioning and a solid rust free body, this is a car you can confidently fly in and drive home."], "seller_name": "Significant Cars", "title": "1969 Mercedes-Benz 230 ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "18500", "kilometers": 165319.923, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/30806162", "brand": "Mercedes-Benz", "reference_id": "30806162", "year": "1969", "model": "230", "specs": {"Engine": "I6", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "102,747 miles", "Transmission": "Manual 5-Speed", "Interior/Exterior": "Tan / White", "Drive Train": "Other", "Fuel": "Gasoline", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Tan / White"}}
