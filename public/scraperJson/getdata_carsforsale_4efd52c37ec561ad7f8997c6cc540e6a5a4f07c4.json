I purchased this carwith 58k on it and have been using it as a daily driver in the summer for thelast 4 years. It does burn some oil and smokes a little bit at times. and idlesa little rough at times as well (always suspected a vacuum leak that I couldnever find. When I bought it I had done all the tune up stuff plugs, wires etcbrakes etc...It has been a very reliable and safe car. Suspension is tight withno squeaks and or rattles. Steers and handles well. Drives straight, stop andhandles very well. The transmission will delay going into gear on occasion inthe colder weather only for a few seconds though. shifts okay at every othertime. The paint is shiny but aged and has blisters and cracks in a few places.Rear bumper has cracks at both corners. The stripe decals are pealing from theroof. Drivers seat torn. Passenger door bottom is rusted on inside. Radiatorsupport bottom is rusted which I know is common. Frame and floors are solid.Speedometer will stick on on 0 on occasion but only for a minute or two. Allother gauges work properly. Headliner, rugs,dash are all in good shape. 14 inchtires, wheels replaced about 10k miles ago. Please keep in mind that this a 40year old car.
