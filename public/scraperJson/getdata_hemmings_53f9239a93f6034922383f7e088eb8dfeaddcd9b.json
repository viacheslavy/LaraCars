This car was federalized when it first arrived in the US and received smog equipment, front reflectors, and a MPH speedometer, but still retains unique European details, including side indicator repeaters, smaller rear bumperettes, the more powerful Euro motor, the small lower brake light and Euro Hella H4 headlights. The car makes 231 HP compared to its US counterpart with 214 HP.  Wonderful original condition. Fully galvanized body, AC system, and highly reliable. Some wear to leather seats and door panels. Dash and carpet look great for age. German canvas top in good condition except tears in plastic windows on both sides. Paint is excellent with minor stone chips on front hood and a great luster and shine. Garaged in climate controlled environment since purchase and only driven in good weather. Replaced battery with new one with permanent trickle-charger hook-up. Replaced tires and added cloth cover and reproduction owner's manual.
