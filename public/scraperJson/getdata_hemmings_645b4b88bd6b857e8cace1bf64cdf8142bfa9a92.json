It's a 2 owner,  adult driven car,  with a very interesting twist on the power plant.  The original owner of the car had a Procharger centrifugal supercharger system  professionally installed on the car.  It's a P-1SC model supercharger which is a self contained oiling system developed by Procharger so there is no tapping into the oil pan for a return line or hooking up an oil supply line.  It's also a very efficient and productive unit with hp gains in the 50%-80% range over stock.  The estimated horsepower on this car would be in the 300 range give or take, not to bad for a 6 cylinder!  It really is a blast to drive as the RPMS rise the car really goes!  If you're looking for a very nice reliable driver that has never been raced this car would fall into that category.  The performance red paint is in nice shape, especially for being 17 years old with only a couple small dings by the drivers front fender that one really needs to look for to see.  The interior has had seat covers on it the majority of its life so the original fabric buckets seats are in great shape as well as the carpeting and rest of interior.  Cobr[

It's a 2 owner,  adult driven car,  with a very interesting twist on the power plant.  The original owner of the car had a Procharger centrifugal supercharger system  professionally installed on the car.  It's a P-1SC model supercharger which is a self contained oiling system developed by Procharger so there is no tapping into the oil pan for a return line or hooking up an oil supply line.  It's also a very efficient and productive unit with hp gains in the 50%-80% range over stock.  The estimated horsepower on this car would be in the 300 range give or take, not to bad for a 6 cylinder!  It really is a blast to drive as the RPMS rise the car really goes!  If you're looking for a very nice reliable driver that has never been raced this car would fall into that category.  The performance red paint is in nice shape, especially for being 17 years old with only a couple small dings by the drivers front fender that one really needs to look for to see.  The interior has had seat covers on it the majority of its life so the original fabric buckets seats are in great shape as well as the carpeting and rest of interior.  Cobra wheels, some emblems, and a wing have been added to give it a high performance look.  The underside of the car is clean and floor pans are solid.  We do have a Carfax confirming mileage, no accidents and 2 owners so buy with confidence.  Feel free to call us at 507-386-1726 or email '", "[Email Dealer]", "''"], "Mileage:": "43394"}},

It's a 2 owner,  adult driven car,  with a very interesting twist on the power plant.  The original owner of the car had a Procharger centrifugal supercharger system  professionally installed on the car.  It's a P-1SC model supercharger which is a self contained oiling system developed by Procharger so there is no tapping into the oil pan for a return line or hooking up an oil supply line.  It's also a very efficient and productive unit with hp gains in the 50%-80% range over stock.  The estimated horsepower on this car would be in the 300 range give or take, not to bad for a 6 cylinder!  It really is a blast to drive as the RPMS rise the car really goes!  If you're looking for a very nice reliable driver that has never been raced this car would fall into that category.  The performance red paint is in nice shape, especially for being 17 years old with only a couple small dings by the drivers front fender that one really needs to look for to see.  The interior has had seat covers on it the majority of its life so the original fabric buckets seats are in great shape as well as the carpeting and rest of interior.  Cobra wheels, some emblems, and a wing have been added to give it a high performance look.  The underside of the car is clean and floor pans are solid.  We do have a Carfax confirming mileage, no accidents and 2 owners so buy with confidence.  Feel free to call us at 507-386-1726 or email '", "[Email Dealer]", "''"], "Mileage:": "43394"}},
