Thanks to a smart-running small block V8, a lowered suspension, and a great color combination, it's the gentleman's alternative to the bowtie.  ", "  The dark blue paint is subtle, but with the big wheels and lowered stance, this truck is definitely going to get noticed. These trucks are quite popular today, and it's easy to see why, and if you're not a Chevy guy but like the way it looks, then perhaps this GMC is a good fit. The bodywork is quite good, with super straight bed sides and good gaps all around. Paint is quite good, with professional work showing everywhere you look and a brilliant shine that only comes with lots of hand labor, plus the modern urethane paint gives a great shine with minimal maintenance requirements. The bed is beautifully finished with oak planks and spray-in bedliner on the fender wells, and it appears that the only notable deviation from stock specifications (at least externally) is a few shaved emblems and the cool charcoal gray paint treatment on the front grille. Nice chrome bumpers, twin mirrors, and a minimum of fussiness give it a polished look, suggesting that this GMC is capable of doing more than just hauling your gear.  ", "  Buying this 1500 gets you some upgraded upholstery inside your new GMC pickup, which amounts to a beautifully tailored bench seat that's far more comfortable than the original park bench. It's all in excellent shape, with dark gray carpets to help control noise and heat and a set of door panels that were an upgrade over the usual all-metal echo chambers. You also get some brushed metal accents, a sporty steering wheel, and a bunch of gauges that are some of the best-looking dials of the period. The lenses are a little faded but the faces of the instruments still look crisp and clear. You'll also note that this is a factory A/C truck and the hardware has been made for easy maintenance, although it appears to need a recharge today. And while some may think the lack of a radio is a demerit, I prefer to look at it as an opportunity to install whatever you'd like rather than living with some outdated tune box installed decades ago.   ", "  A smooth-running 350 cubic inch V8 was stuffed under the hood, and in the relatively lightweight pickup, it makes for entertaining performance. With a mild camshaft inside, it has a great eight-cylinder burble and there's a bunch of chrome up top to really dress it up. The rest of the satin black engine bay is all business, but service access is good and thanks to power steering and brakes, this truck is a pleasure to drive around town. The transmission is a TH350 3-speed automatic that powers a 12-bolt rear end with relatively tall gears, so highway cruising is relaxed and easy.

We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks like this and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this rare Jimmy!     HISTORY:  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The K5 Blazer was the smallest full size SUV version of the Chevrolet C/K family. Introduced to the Chevrolet line in 1969, the full-size Blazer was replaced in 1995 by the Chevrolet Tahoe. In 1970, GMC introduced its own model of the truck, called the Jimmy, which discontinued in 1991 and replaced by the GMC Yukon in 1993. Both were based on the short wheelbase trucks and were available with either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The Blazer's long wheelbase relative (with an integrated rear body, and doors for 2nd row passengers) is known as the Chevrolet Suburban. The \"Jimmy\" name was chosen to reflect the GMmy sound in a similar manner in how Jeep was a pronunciation of GP in the competing market. The K5 Blazer and Jimmy had \"full convertible\" removable tops until 1975. In 1976, GM introduced a half-cab design that was less prone to leaks and slightly safer in a roll-over. These half cabs are convertible starting at a few inches behind the driver/passenger doors all the way back to the tailgate.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d-Wikipedia     SPECIFICS / BUILD INFORMATION  EXTERIOR:  -Restored.  -Brand new paint and bodywork.  -BFGoodrich Tires.  -American racing wheels.  -Removable Hardtop.

With that said absolutely no expenses were spared building this off roading machine for pure enjoyment on and off road. The body was completely restored with very high shine base/clear Green metallic paint work with black accents keeping the stealth vibe to this military grade build. Custom made black canvas top with stainless framing to fold down for a full convertible cruise or off roading experience or hit some weather and keep it up to cover up to 4 passengers fully strapped into they're own Sparco racing seat belt harnesses holding them safely into the comfortable bucket seats front and rear. The seats are comfy but built to hold you in tight, extra safety feature is full roll cage surrounding all passengers. When your foot gets heavy on the throttle of the built 454 Ci big block that has been bored .060 over and topped with Merlin heads with an estimated 575 horsepower and 590 lb torque, this is fed by a brand new quick fuel carburetor with long tube headers and backed by a turbo 400 trans. The ignition is MSD 6AL unit to fire it right up. To keep this beast a float it was upgraded as well custom built DANA 60's by DTS Drive Train Specialist, with air locker front and Detroit locker in rear, added to those a full set of FOX racing shocks. This thing could climb anywhere you desire and to get you there 10 ply Kumho road venture mud terrains were mounted on XD powder coated 20' rims to last against any terrain. And incase you get in a pinch or need to pull someone else out it is equipped with a mile marker 10,000 lb winch on the custom diamond plate front bumper that is built to match the rear and are both powder coated to hold up to the road. Other cool facts about truck are due to its 7 foot tall owner the floor boards were modified so the front seats have just as much leg room as the rear.
