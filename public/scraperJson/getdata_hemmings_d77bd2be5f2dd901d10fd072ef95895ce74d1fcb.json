I was told it was the longest, heaviest car General Motors ever manufactured. Sherman is white with black interior that has some silver thread in it. Sherman arrived at our house in approximately 1961. My family consisted of; my banker father,  my homemaker mother, my little sister and myself. Mom drove my sister and I to school, she made us sit in the backseat. One day on the way home, I saw smoke coming out under the passenger side of the front seat. My mom pulled over and got us out of the car. Later that night, after being told the motor under the seat overheated, she told dad that she wanted cars that had no electrical seats that might endanger us girls by catching on fire. Dad was about ready for a new car and told his brother, a car dealer, the new requirement. Since dad was a banker, he wanted a nice car to take clients to meals and etc. My uncle said he had just the car for him. A 1959 Cadillac that had no power windows or seats. Dad brought the car home and I don't remember which parent said \u201cit's as big as a Sherman tank\u201d. We all piled in for a ride. We went a couple of blocks and it stopped. We walked home, called Uncle Ed and mom said she never wanted another car from him. It turned out that when the gas gauge showed a quarter tank, it was empty, It also had a speedometer that didn't register the correct speed. Dad thought than would come in handy if he got stopped for speeding. He could then have it fixed. Dad loved the new car and mom liked Cadillacs so all was well. I remember the family driving up to the World's Fair in Seattle Washington in 1963. My sister and I split the back seat and it was packed with all my Barbies and my sisters Troll Dolls, each on there respective sides. I always sat on the passengers side and my sister behind the driver. To make the trip more affordable, they though we'd camp on some nights and stay in motels the other nights. We had never camped before so off to Sears we went for camping things. The latest in a tent, no center pole, was purchased with all the other stuff like a camping stove, lanterns, sleeping bags etc. Dad loved to BBQ so he got a small habachi for BBQing. On the way north, we stopped in Yosemite to stay for about a week. When we stayed in Tuoluomne Meadows, it was cool at night. He BBQ'd something for dinner and we turned in for the night. At some point, he woke up and it was cold in the tent. He brought in the smoldering habachi to warm up the tent. A couple hours later my mom woke up coughing. She woke everyone else. My sister wouldn't wake up so they carried her out to the fresh air. My dad had never camped and didn't know that he tried to kill us with carbon monoxide fumes. My sister did come to and we never camped again. We made it to the Fair and home without other incidents. Dad drove Sherm until the late sixties. I took my driving test in Sherm. The man at DMV told me that he wouldn't make me paraell park the car, if I could do a K turn I'd pass. I'd take Sherm cruising the Esplanade in Redondo Beach and up through Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. I could fit all my high school friends in it at one time.I started working in a bank and Sherm became my car. I did run out of gas on Hawthorne Blvd.after work one day, it was tricky to judge the gas gauge. You didn't push Sherman far. The traffic was backed up for miles. After that, I got gas whenever the gauge was at half full. I moved to Santa Barbara in 1971 and the place I rented had an old barn that I used as a garage. I did screw up one there time with the gas gauge. I was on my way to work, it was potluck day and we all dressed up for Halloween. You guessed it, I ran out of gas. I went to a house near by and rang the doorbell. The person wouldn't open the door but did offer to call my work. When the Assistant Manager came to get me, she couldn't stop laughing. I was dressed as a little girl, had my casserole dish in hand and waiting on a street corner. Good ole Sherm. That was the last time I ran out of gas! I was dating a guy that threw the Javelin for UCSB. We could go to track meets with his javelin in the car slanted with the tip out the window. When we got married, we got a newer sports car. What a difference! My dad took Sherm  home, as I said he loved that car. He kept it until I bought a house in 1980. He said now I had a garage and it was my turn to house Sherm. I used Sherm to drive a bride and groom after their ceremony, take friends cruising State street in Santa Barbara, and driving him when I wanted to feel like I was in high school again. Old time rock n roll playing on the radio. My husband makes me back  it in the garage. With a long drive, curving drive way, I'm tired of twisting around to do that. The steering wheel had an inside silver ring, which you used to honk the horn. My dad broke the top half when he hit it too hard and I broke the bottom half doing the same thing. You know press the bar that goes across instead of the silver ring. One year I bought a Christmas tree from the Boy Scout lot. When the guy helping me asked if I wanted it tied on top, I told him no. I told him it would fit in the trunk. He offered me the tree free if it did. It fit, but since it was a Boy Scout lot I didn't take him up on his offer. Since about 1995, Clark Motors in Santa Barbara has done all the servicing on it. It is fun to drive, I mean float down the road. People look and smile and give a thumbs up. You just feel good driving Sherman. It's time for someone else to enjoy Sherman and I hope he gets a good home.", "For additional information please phone Dave Henry at 805 705-4924.", "__________________________________________________________", "Spokemotors.com is not a dealer but a marketing and advertising firm.

Some 14,000 would be sold, many purchased as investments. The final 200 were designated as ''Bicentennial Edition'' commemorating America's 200th birthday. These cars were white with a dual-color red/blue pinstripe along the upper bodyside and inside, a commemorative plaque was mounted on the dashboard. When Cadillac reintroduced the Eldorado convertible for the 1984 model year, several owners of 1976 model convertibles felt they had been deceived and launched an unsuccessful class action lawsuit against General Motors. Having received a major facelift the previous year, the 1976 Eldorado received only minor styling changes, including a new grille and revised taillamp lenses.", "To see over 80 photos of this car, including under carriage please visit our website www.grautogallery.com", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.
