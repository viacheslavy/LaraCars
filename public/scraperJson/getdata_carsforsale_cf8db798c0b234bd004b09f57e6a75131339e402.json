We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this rare Camaro!  HISTORY  The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as a two-door coup\u00c3\u00a9 or convertible with 2+2 seating, and a choice of 230 cu in (3.8 L), 250 cu in (4.1 L) inline-6 or 302 cu in (4.9 L), 307 cu in (5.0 L), 327 cu in (5.4 L), 350 cu in (5.7 L), 396 cu in (6.5 L), 427 cu in (7.0 L) V8 powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the Corvair, would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro.

This Z28 RSjust came out of a 20 year hibernation and is extremely original. Car comes withits Original Protectoplate Warranty Card, Original Build Sheet (just found underpass. seat and in amazing condition as shown in pics) and Original 1970 WindowRegistration among many other original documents and early pictures. Theoriginal LT1 350/360hp engine was professionally rebuilt to factory specs bylegendary racer/machinist Ed Hale before car was stored away and it runs andsounds like a dream. Unfortunately he had to replace the original engine block(block only) with a TJY code 1973 350 4 bolt main truck block due to a thrownrod in the original CTC block. Pretty much everything else from the originalengine was used in the rebuild except the Carb which is now a 750 Holley. Thiscar runs, drives, shifts, and handles extremely strong and tight. Tires havegood tread but are old and should be replaced for safety. Has factory F41suspension package, power steering and power front disc brakes. All body panelsare original to car and very straight and smooth and I believe have never beenremoved. Body gaps and alignment are perfect. The only body repair that I canfind on car is what looks to have been a minor dent repair on the lower leftquarter panel behind rear tire. The repaint is over 30 years old so it does havesome scratches, touch ups, and fading but still looks pretty good for an olderpaint job. The hood and trunk stripes are now blue and were originally black.All of the chrome and trim on car is original and without dents or damage butmay need polishing or resurfacing to be show quality. All of the glass is clearand without cracks."], "seller_name": "For sale by Owner - Florida", "title": "1970 Chevrolet Camaro ", "total_results": "440 .

One glance at this 1970 Chevrolet Camaro Baldwin-Motion tribute and you know there have been some serious investments in upgrades.  The distinct paint package, performance V8, four-speed stick, and side pipes all tell you this is the coolest Camaro you can gets your hands on!  ", "  Baldwin-Motion is mentioned in the same breath as Yenko or Nickey in the Chevrolet communities.  This hallowed performance car name only produced a handful of originals, which means buying one today will require forgoing a large home, and it'll make you nervous every time it leaves the garage.  So the obvious solution is the Camaro you see here.  This 1970 coupe carries the iconic and unique full striping package that came from ordering your Camaro through Motion Performance via Baldwin Chevrolet. Even those who don't recognize this hallmark will quiver at the large side exhaust pipes, huge cowl hood, and super-slick red paint.  But more than just look the part, everything from the shine of the bumpers, to the full-width spoiler let you know the detail work on this one is cut-above.      ", "  The deep, dark interior wants you to know this Camaro immediately gets down to business.  You sit down in modern ProCar bucket seats that hug your body better than anything from the '70s ever could.  Your left hand gets the grippy thin factory-style steering wheel, and your right one may never want to leave the Hurst shifter.  You have all the right gauges, including a SunPro auxiliary trio under the dash.  All of this is designed to get your heart racing even before you twist the key and hear those side pipes roar.  ", "  Because these B-M Camaros were all about the monster motor, you'll love showing off the engine bay.  The 350 cubic-inch V8 is dressed to impress with both plenty of shine from the polished components and a bit of dark attitude with the fender walls and air topper.  But what you and the other enthusiasts will love the most is the proper Motion valve covers.  This V8 backs up its powerful looks with performance upgrades such as the bored .60 over kit, Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, and a full header package.  The coupe makes all the right muscle car growls, and you're in complete control of this sound and fury thanks to the four-speed manual transmission.  This is a muscle machine made to go hit the road with great features like thick sway bars front & rear, power steering, front disc brakes, and BF Goodrich T/As on proper Z-28 style wheels.  ", "  Your heart will skip a beat every time the ferocious exhaust fires up in your garage.  This Camaro comes with all the admiration of a hallowed classic American muscle nameplate, and more importantly, there's no stress when you want to go out and have a little fun.
