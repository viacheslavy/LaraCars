Built right and commands attention! We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this incredible second generation Camaro!  HISTORY  The very sleek second-generation Camaro, introduced in February 1970, was built only as a coupe. The sizzling-hot 1970 Z28 packed a new 350-cid solid-lifter V-8, while the RS appearance upgrade now featured a split front bumper.  Camaro power ratings diminished in 1971 as GM prepared engines for unleaded fuels. 1972 marked the end for the Camaro SS \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and its big-block 396 V-8 option; two years later, the Z28 would go on hiatus. The Camaro LT quasi-luxury package appeared in 1973, even as the split-bumper RS entered its final year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d making an LT/RS/Z28 build possible this year only.  A new wrap-around rear window appeared in 1975. Even though 1975-76 Camaro models were relatively mundane, sales picked up significantly during 1976. In mid-1977, the Z28 returned, featuring bold graphics, extensive handling mods and fair-to-middlin' V-8 performance. Camaro sales reached a record 282,571 in 1979.  Among second-generation Z28s, the truly brutal '70 is especially prized, while the once plentiful 1978-79s are still easiest to find. Camaros equipped with uplevel LT/Berlinetta packages might be the sleepers here.

pleased to present this 1971 Chevrolet Camaro. We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this rare Camaro!  HISTORY  Introduced in February 1970, the second-generation Camaro was produced through the 1981 model year, with cosmetic changes made in 1974 and 1978 model years. The car was heavily restyled and became somewhat larger and wider with the new styling. Still based on the F-body platform, the new Camaro was similar to its predecessor, with a unibody structure, front subframe, an A-arm front suspension, and leaf springs to control the solid rear axle. Road & Track picked the 1971 SS350 as one of the 10 best cars in the world in August 1971. RS (shown to the right), SS package was dropped in 1972 and reintroduced in 1996.
