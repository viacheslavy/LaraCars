This classic Corvette is Hugger orange with a Tan soft top and a Black hard top included in the purchase. The Corvette has a 327 motor hooked to a 3 speed manual transmission. The engine was rebuilt less than 10000 miles ago. The car has 93999 acutal miles. The soft was replaced in 2002 with very little use since. The soft top shows no sign of abuse or ear.The 1963 Sting Ray production cars lineage can be traced to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette and perhaps more directly Mitchells racing Sting Ray. The Q-Corvette initiated in 1957 envisioned a smaller more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model boasting a rear transaxle independent rear suspension and four-wheel disc brakes with the rear brakes mounted inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful with peaked fenders a long nose and a short bobbed tail.The vehicles inner structure received as much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958\"?62 Corvette. The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. Passenger room was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase and the reinforcing steel girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer.The 1963 Corvette Stingray is a piece of American Automotive History. This car can be enjoyed for years to come and turn heads where ever it is. This 1963 Corvette Stingray  for sale is located in our Indianapolis Showroom and can be seen in greater detail including an HD video at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.
