And The Beatles perform their last live gig a 42 minute concert on the roof of Apple Corps HQ in London. During that same year this beautiful Brilliant Silver Mach 1 rolls off the assembly line. Since 1969 the car has undergone a full restoration completed this year with only 100 miles since the rebuild. And a throaty 351 Cleveland under the hood. You??ll be amazed at how well this Mach 1 cruises down the road. You forget you??re behind the wheel of a car that is almost 50 years old. The Ford Mustang Mach 1 is a performance-oriented option package of the Ford Mustang originally introduced by Ford in August 1968 as a package for the 1969 model year. Ford first used the name Mach 1 in its 1959 display of a concept called the Levacar Mach I at the Ford Rotunda. This concept vehicle used a cushion of air as propulsion. 1969 was the benchmark year for Ford Mustang in its proliferation of performance names and engines. No fewer than six factory performance Mustang models were available (GT Boss 302 Boss 429 Shelby GT350 Shelby GT500 and the Mach 1). Additionally seven variations of V-8s were available in the 69?70 models; most of these also available in the new Mach 1.To view the car in greater detail including an HD video and 100+ HD pictures please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our Denver showroom.

And the first Generation Mach 1 that was only built for two years did not disappoint, especially when it was equipped with the ''Holy Grail'' of options like this 428 Super Cobra Jet, R-Code, 4-speed ''Drag Pack'' car.  I will get right to the point on this car considering if you are unaware of what a Mach 1 is then this is not the car for you.  First off, this car was purchased by the consignor in 1971, where he immediately changed the color from red to Wimbledon White at the age of 18.  The seller has been working on cars long before then and still today.  He has amassed a very nice collection of cars and Fords are what he knows best.  The latest restoration kept the car white but the body, frame and everything else were done to Factory Specs.  The non-original engine was pulled and sent to Mikes Competition Engines where it had a full work up and then put on a dyno with scores coming out at 460 HP with 513 Foot pounds of Torque.  This car is a factory R-Code with original build sheet to prove it.  The car comes with the original oil cooler, oil pan, heads and intake manifold.  It has a 780 CFM race ready carb, the original close ratio 4-speed, shaker, 9'' housing and 31 Spline Axles.  It also has a Hurst competition plus linkage and Wilwood disc brakes for stopping power.  There is little else we have offered that runs, sounds and drives like this car.  It has some great history and is well worth the asking price.", "To see over 80 photos of this car, including under carriage please visit our website www.grautogallery.com", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.

The world had caught Mustang fever after the introduction of the 1964 1/2 model, and Ford was working double time to try and keep up with demand. The factory in Dearborn, Michigan pumped out a whopping 607,568 Mustangs between August of 1965 and July of 1966. What caused this incredible demand you ask? How about a gorgeous body, outstanding performance, and a price the every man could afford. King of the hill for chart topping model year 1966 was the ''GT'' model you see here. Ford chose to give the Mustang a little European flare on the outside, and the performance of a thoroughbred under the hood. Built around the standard 289CI V-8 available in the base model, the GT's ''A'' code 289 featured a bigger four barrel carburetor, better intake, and higher duration camshaft to increase the output from the base model's 200hp up to 225hp in the GT. The suspension was upgraded as well with stiffer springs for better handling and front disc brakes(a rarity in those years) were added to make sure you could ''woah'' this pony down. On the outside, GT models got a custom grille with fog lamps on either side of the iconic ''Pony'' emblem. On the sides you will find rocker stripes that look so good, Ford still uses them on Mustangs to this day. Out back the GT model has a unique fuel filler cap on a blackout panel between the tail lamps, with dual exhaust exiting underneath. This particular GT has been upgraded with aftermarket American Racing ''Torq-Thrust'' wheels and white letter BFGoodrich Radial T/As. This wheel and tire combination is totally fitting on this classic pony car, and combined with the square set body, they give this Mustang a stance that is just magnificent. On the inside, it is all business. Black vinyl buckets up front separated by the classic four on the floor shifter with white cue ball handle. The insturment panel is unique to the GT model, and features a speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge and ammeter in five round dials. There is no A/C or power features in this performance pony, if you want luxury, go buy a Galaxie!! This Mustang was built to burn rubber while playing the Star Spangled banner of engine noise!!", "This Mustang is one amazing machine, and it can be yours today!!
