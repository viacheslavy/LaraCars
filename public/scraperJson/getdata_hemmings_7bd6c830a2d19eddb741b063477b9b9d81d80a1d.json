And even some of the brightwork is part of the mechanical enhancements, too, like the pulleys and aluminum radiator.  And we know you love how the block was painted to match the rest of the truck's turquoise.  But more than just look great, this is a powerful package with a Holley Four-barrel carburetor and Weiand intake.  There's also a lot of comfort in this classic, including a TH400 three-speed automatic transmission and power steering.  Plus, the front end is a far more modern setup with an independent suspension that features sway bar front disc brakes.", "A terrific all-around presentation with all the right upgrades makes for an iconic classic with plenty of modern appeal.

The body is straight, but with that being said it does have some rust to give it the look of an old barn find.  It has lettering for detail to make it look like an older service truck.

On the inside it has all been redone.  The seat has been recovered in the correct style vinyl.  Also new carpet and a headliner board was installed.  When you look at the dash they replaced the steering column with a brushed aluminum tilt and added a Banjo Wheel.  The factory style gauges were left and they added a set of Pro comp under dash gauges and a tach.  A short console was installed and it houses the Lokar Shifter.", "Finally, we will take a look at heartbeat of the Chevy.  Under the hood the firewall and inner fenders look like the body.  But the power comes from a late model fuel injected 4.8/5.3 Engine that's mated to a 350 Turbo Trans and a 10 Bolt Rear End.  The frame under this Truck is from an S10 with Four Wheel Disc Brakes that are Power along with Power Steering.  The fuel system has been replaced with an Aluminum tank with new lines and pump.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.
