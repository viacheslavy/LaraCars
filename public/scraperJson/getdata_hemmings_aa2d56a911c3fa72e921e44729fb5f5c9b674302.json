The engine used aluminum-alloy heads and cast-steel pistons, as well as two water pumps. It also had a unique distributor with a coil assembly that actually consisted of two coils, one for each cylinder bank. Though the Zephyr V-12 no more resembled previous Lincoln engines than the ubiquitous V-8 (despite sharing the latter's stroke), it was more like a \u201c12-cylinder Ford\u201d than a classic multi-cylinder powerplant in character. Ford improved the engine by adopting hydraulic valve lifters for 1938 and cast-iron heads and oiling improvements for 1942.", "Inside, the tan leather and cloth seats are in excellent condition, the vehicle's matching carpet is in very good order.

Styled by Bob Gregorie, the original Continental was one of the first cars to recognized as more than a machine by New York's Museum of Modern Art and the Classic Car Club of America. Gregorie used the Lincoln-Zephyr as the Continental's starting point. The Continental was seven inches lower than the standard Lincoln, eliminating the need for running boards for ingress and egress.
