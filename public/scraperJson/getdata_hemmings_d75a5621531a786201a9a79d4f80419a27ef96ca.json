It is a numbers matching car that has had one repaint in it's life, and the motor rebuilt about 7,000 miles ago.  So, what you see on the odometer is what is on the chassis.  We have a giant stack of receipts that go with this car including motor specs.  This is a very nice car.", "As you will see in the pics, this is about a 15 year old paint job and it presents very well for the age.  We are always brutally honest here and we will tell you that your eyes do not deceive you, the car and the hood do not match.  The hood is more the original color of the car.  Do not let that detract you from how nice this car is.  A little paint never hurt anyone.  Correct paint and this car goes up 30% in value from what we are asking for it.  Nothing like having built in equity the day you buy it.", "The interior of this cool car is in excellent shape.  You will not see any rips or tears in the seats or headliner.  The carpet is in great shape as are the T Tops.  The fit and finish on the deluxe door panels look great and the rubber trim is in great shape as well.  We just can not say enough good things about this car.  You can make it a daily driver or kick it up a notch and make it a great collectible that it is.", "Now for under the hood and the business end of things.  As you will see in the pic, this is the original motor to the car.  This is a real LT1.  If that wasn't enough, this motor has been completely gone through and we have the data sheets to show it.  Just to name a few things, this has had .030 over Eagle pistons and Eagle Rods, aluminum roller rockers, comp cam, and the list just goes on and on.  You will see nice long tube headers and a great sounding FlowMaster exhaust as well.  Just hit the key on this baby and step your foot off the clutch, and get ready to have the drive of your life.  This baby really cooks.", "We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms with as little as 10% down and no prepayment penalties.  This way, you don't have to take all of your cash out at once and you can pay it off when you want to.

This is especially true thanks to a professional respray that gives its factory-correct color an updated more modern shine.

This one even has provisions for air conditioning.  As the driver you get a three-spoke steering wheel.  Just ahead of that is the large dual pod gauges, including the tach.  Just to the side are a full set of auxiliary readouts for a true sports car experience.  This is a T-top coupe with the final year for the removable rear window.  So you can really let the wind run through the cabin.", "Lift the hood and see that this orange 'Vette has its engine bay filled with a big orange V8.  The 454 cubic-inch motor fires up readily, like a big dog ready to go for his morning run.   The V8 inhales deeply though a four-barrel carburetor, and it gives a fantastic sound out of the recently added Xlerator mufflers on the dual exhaust.  The stout TH400 three-speed automatic does a fantastic job of deciding at a moment's notice if you want a confident cruiser or a powerful muscle machine.  Plus, it's easy to keep all this power corralled with great driving features such as the power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, and Firestone Firehawk rubber at each corner.", "This Stingray has the right look, price, and factory-correct features to keep an enthusiast like you happy, and it even comes with the owner's manual.
