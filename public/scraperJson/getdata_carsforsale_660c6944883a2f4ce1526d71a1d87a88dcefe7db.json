Under rapid development, the T-Bird went from idea to prototype in about a year with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model which created the market niche eventually known as the personal luxury car. It was named after a mythological creature that was worshiped by indigenous people of North America. The T-Bird was relatively unchanged for the 1956 model year but was revised for 1957 with a reshaped front bumper, a larger grille, larger tailfins and larger tail lamps. Also in 1957 the 312 cu in (5.1 L) V8 became the T-Bird's standard engine with an increase to 245 horsepower. This particular T-Bird is a 4 owner car that has always been stored in a climate controlled garage and has 46,276 original miles. It was originally Colonial White but was repainted about 3 years ago in Flame Red. The hard top was repainted in its original color and looks very classy when attached. The rims were also repainted Flame Red and are wrapped with new white wall radial tires. At the same time the bumpers were rechromed and show like new. The original 312 ci V8 engine and automatic transmission have never been rebuilt and still run incredibly well. The interior is completely original with the exception of the seat which was recovered in its original color, the Custom Auto Sound AM/FM Cassette player, the Sun Pro gauges, the ashtray mounted cup holder and the cover on the steering wheel. It shows incredibly well for its age with the exception of some chrome items that could use replating. Absolutely everything is working on this timeless classic except for the clock. All said and done we would classify this is a #3 car and would appraise it at $71,225. We have priced it as a #4 car to ensure a quick sale so if you like what you see you better call before it\u2019s too late!"], "seller_name": "Sterling Motors INC", "title": "1957 Ford Thunderbird ", "total_results": "", "price": "39900", "kilometers": 74458.084, "total_pages": 37, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/22606219", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "22606219", "year": "1957", "model": "Thunderbird", "specs": {"Engine": "V8 Other", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "46,276 miles", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior/Exterior": "White / Red", "Drive Train": "Other", "Fuel": "Gasoline", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "White / Red"}},

The Ford Thunderbird began life in February 1953 in direct response to Chevrolet's new sports car, the Corvette, which was publicly unveiled in prototype form just a month before. Under rapid development, the Thunderbird went from idea to prototype in about a year, being unveiled to the public at the Detroit Auto Show on February 20, 1954. Like the Corvette, the Thunderbird had a two-seat coupe/convertible layout. Production of the Thunderbird began later in 1954 on September 9 with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model on October 22, 1954. Though sharing some design characteristics with other Fords of the time, such as single, circular headlamps and tail lamps and modest tailfins, the Thunderbird was sleeker and more athletic in shape, and had features like a faux hood scoop and a 140-mph speedometer hinting a higher performance nature that other Fords didn't possess.This Thunderbird has undergone a partial restoration, and is in fantastic driver quality condition. The list of mechanicals that have been modified are: The 312 CID Ford engine was swapped out in 1974 with a 350 CID Chevrolet engine to provide a little more get up and go for this classy chassis. It is paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission that was also added in 1974. The car has 2 known owners and was restored back in 1998 by the latest owner to preserve this piece if history. The exterior is in good condition and would get some heads turning driving down the road. This car has just the one hard top but is in nice condition and will keep you out of that wet weather. The interior of the car is in good original condition with a few small additions such as the engine turned aluminum dash to improve the appearance. The new cassette player hidden in the glove box with the pioneer speaker behind the seat will make the drive much nicer while listening to your favorite songs. Some additional features include power steering, power windows, white walls, Cassette, AM/FM radio, and power seats.All in all, this adds up to a clean light blue bird that really is a joy to drive. It is hard to not look good driving a Thunderbird, especially when it is a T-Bird that looks this good. Call us today about this sweet little bit of nostalgia!

The Ford Thunderbird began life in February 1953 in direct response to Chevrolet's new sports car, the Corvette, which was publicly unveiled in prototype form just a month before. Under rapid development, the Thunderbird went from idea to prototype in about a year, being unveiled to the public at the Detroit Auto Show on February 20, 1954. Like the Corvette, the Thunderbird had a two-seat coupe/convertible layout. Production of the Thunderbird began later on in 1954 on September 9 with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model on October 22, 1954. Though sharing some design characteristics with other Fords of the time, such as single, circular headlamps and tail lamps and modest tailfins, the Thunderbird was sleeker and more athletic in shape, and had features like a faux hood scoop and a 140 mph speedometer hinting a higher performance nature that other Fords didn't possess. This particular Thunderbird has undergone a partial restoration, and is in fantastic driver quality condition. The list of mechanical that have been replaced is extensive: the brake master cylinder, shoes, wheel cylinder, power booster, and slave cylinder, power steering assembly and steering box, heater core and valve, heater control panel, oil pump, all belts and hoses, stabilizer bar, ends and bushings, shocks, rear axle and front wheel bearings, and full exhaust system. Additionally, the radiator was vatted and rodded, the Holley carburetor was rebuilt. The interior wasn\u00c3\u00a2??t forgotten on this restoration either, as the whole interior has been redone including the carpets and headliner.All in all, this adds up to a porthole window D-code Baby Bird that really is a joy to drive. It is hard to not look good driving a Thunderbird, especially when it is a T-Bird that looks this good. Call us today about this sweet little bit of nostalgia!

This 1970 Ford Mustang Mach 1 is a bargain compared to its investment-grade siblings, so if you're looking for a genuine Mach 1 you can drive, here it is!  ", "  Few will argue that the 1970 Mustang isn't one of the best-looking designs of the muscle car era, particularly in fastback form. But before we talk about performance and engines and all that, take a look at the special Mach 1 gear this one wears, including the hood scoop, chin spoiler, and Mach 1 rocker panel callouts. Other goodies include a set of aftermarket rear window slats and black tail spoiler, neither of which make the car go faster but they definitely look like they do. The awesome Acapulco Blue paint is one of the most popular colors, and even though it's got some use and age on it, nobody's going to complain when they hear the rumble of the V8 underneath. You could give this one a color sand and buff to really take it up a notch or two, because, honestly, there aren't many cars that are more deserving. Even as it sits, everybody loves a Mustang fastback.  ", "  High-back buckets sport Ford's patented comfort-weave upholstery which is just that: a woven vinyl that's surprisingly comfortable and helps keep you cool. Matching black door panels and carpets were installed at the same time, completing the upgrade and looking very tidy. Ford's twin-cockpit design puts a quartet of gauges ahead of the driver, all wrapped in faux woodgrain, while the passenger got an analog clock for symmetry. All the gauges show clear faces and remain fully functional, and there's an upgraded AM/FM stereo radio in the dash which feeds speakers cleverly installed in the rear seat side panels. It shows only a few signs of use, further proof that the comfort-weave upholstery wears like iron and that someone took exceptionally good care of this car. The trunk is finished with a heavy mat, a full-sized spare tire assembly, and a spare tire cover.  ", "  The engine is a correct M-code 351 cubic inch Cleveland V8, which was originally topped by a 2-barrel carburetor and was the standard engine on the Mach 1. It's been upgraded with an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor and matching intake manifold, so it's plenty potent and a blast to drive. The block is covered in Ford Blue paint that is just the right shade, along with some finned valve covers and a big open-element air cleaner with a reproduction decal on top. It starts easily and makes great torque, a muscle car trademark, and you'll find that the Cleveland loves to rev and never seems to run out of breath. A 3-speed C4 automatic transmission makes for relaxed cruising, ably assisted by a 9-inch rear full of highway gears which make high-speed blasts completely effortless. Long-tube headers were ceramic coated so they'll look good practically forever and a Flowmaster exhaust system gives it that bark that Mustang fans love so much. The undercarriage is clean but not detailed, but that's all you really need anyway, be"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1970 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "", "price": "44995", "kilometers": 52823.47, "total_pages": 37, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/35363205", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "35363205", "year": "1970", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 Cleveland V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "32,830 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Stock #": "2565-DFW", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Blue", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Blue"}},

If you read the small hot rod and custom car books back in the day, you'll instantly recognize how well the current owner of this \"Baby\" 'bird nailed the look of a period-correct custom. You'll notice the car's been lowered, rear skirts removed, the continental kit that all '56 T-birds had from the factory is now gone, the wide radial whites, the Olds Fiesta spinner hubcaps, and the lakes pipes all tell the smiling onlooker that this is a car from another era. Inside, the black and white tuck-n-roll interior looks period-perfect, but the steering column and wheel bring a modern touch to the interior. Seat belts assure  the passengers riding inside are securely fastened in whenever this beauty hits the road. The radio is an AM/FM/CD so selecting your favorite cruising tunes is a breeze. Under the hood, you'll see a newer GM-style power steering pump and an aluminum radiator to keep the Y-block cool. A modern Sanden compressor circulates the R134 freon through the AC system to keep the passengers in this iconic collector car cool and comfortable.The battery operates on a cut-off switch to ensure that the power will always be there to start it when you need it. The heart of all this is the smooth-running 292-4V engine accessorized with Thunderbird accessory valve covers and the chrome air cleaner.To see 100-plus pictures and a video of this 1956 Ford Thunderbird, please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com.

Three men are generally credited with creating the original Thunderbird: Lewis D. Crusoe, a retired GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II; George Walker, chief stylist and a Ford vice-president; and Frank Hershey, a Ford designer. Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris, Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker, 'Why can\u2019t we have something like that?'", "Walker promptly telephoned Ford's HQ and told designer Frank Hershey about the idea. Hershey took the idea and began working on the vehicle. The concept was for a two-passenger open car, with a target weight of 2525 lb, an Interceptor V8 and a top speed of over 100 mph. Crusoe saw a painted clay model on, which corresponded closely to the final car; he gave the car the go-ahead in September 1953 after comparing it with current European trends. Unlike the Corvette, the Thunderbird was never a full-blown sporting vehicle; Ford's description was personal luxury car, and the company essentially created this market segment. There was some difficulty in naming the car, with suggestions ranging from the exotic to the ridiculous (Hep Cat, Beaver, Detroiter, Runabout, Arcturus, Savile, El Tigre, and Coronado). Crusoe offered a $250 suit to anyone who could come up with a better name. Stylist Alden \"Gib\" Giberson submitted Thunderbird as part of a list. Giberson got the idea during a lightning storm when he saw an illusion of a bird getting hit by lightning, but this happened because of his view. Giberson never claimed his prize, settling for a $95 suit and an extra pair of trousers from Saks Fifth Avenue. According to Palm Springs Life magazine, the car's final name came not from the Native American symbol as one might expect, but from an ultra-exclusive housing tract in what would later be incorporated as Rancho Mirage, California: Thunderbird Heights", "The car was shown at the Detroit Auto Show in 1954. The first production car came off the line in September, 1954, and went on sale in October as a 1955 model, and sold briskly; 3,500 orders were placed in the first ten days of sale. Ford had only projected building 10,000; eventual 1955 sales were 16,155.", "The Thunderbird was revised for 1957 with a reshaped front bumper, a larger grille and tailfins, and larger tail lamps. The 312 cu in V8 became the Thunderbird's standard engine, and now produced 245 horsepower . Other, even more powerful versions of the 312 cu in V8 were available including one with two four-barrel Holley carburetors and another with a Paxton supercharger delivering 300 horsepower . Though Ford was pleased to see sales of the Thunderbird rise to a record-breaking 21,380 units for 1957, company executives felt the car could do even better, leading to a substantial redesign of the car for 1958.", "The '57 is generally considered the most desirable first generation T Bird.", " ", "This very nice example has had only 2 owners since 1970, and has been in the current owners care since 1994. This is a very nice driving car with a drivetrain rebuilt shortly after the current owner acquired the car. The Paint, Interior, and chrome are in excellent condition with only minor chipping on the underside edges of the hood and doors. The car runs exceptionally well, and is perfect for tours and local cruise-ins-this is a car you and drive and show immediately. Equipped with Town and Country Radio, Power Steering, Heater, Dual Mirrors, Both Tops, it also has a spare set of mounted Bias Ply tires for use during those picky judging events, if you care to do that with the car, as well as the WW radials on it currently.
