I've owned it for 3yrs...originally from TN came to Michigan 8 years ago or so - barely any rust outside & underside - You don't have to worry about going anywhere seriously...I've taken it to Indy 3 times Traverse City multiple times and many other long trips (despite the comical fuel mileage)...15k miles (90% highway) since buying it...The following has been done in the last 15k miles- oil changed (every 3k - only Mobile 1 & Lucas used)- flushed trans- cooling system completely replaced (radiator hoses etc)- installed Edlebrock carb (with rebuilt Rochester original in box) - timing chain - rebuilt alternator - rear main seal - dual exhaust with good sound - manifolds - cabin temperature control - tires - all brakes - rear spring suspension- all shocks- tune up (cap & rotor new plugs & wires)- new battery- front end gone through- valve seals- new hosesLike all older cars there is always something to do and this car is not perfect but completely functional and fun. The car was repainted prior to me buying it and one of the panels wasn't done very well (rookie job)...The interior is complete but it could use new carpet. I removed the seized AC and installed a smaller belt. The washer fluid pump doesn't work. Great candidate for restoration if you wanted to fix some of the odds and ends knowing that a great portion of mechanical stuff has been done.Vehicle is located in Novi MI.

HISTORY  The original Bronco was an ORV (Off-Road Vehicle), intended to compete primarily with Jeep CJ models and the International Harvester Scout. The Bronco's small size riding on a 92-inch (2,337 mm) wheelbase made it maneuverable for some uses, but impractical as a tow vehicle. The Bronco was Ford's first compact SUV.  The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey, who also conceived the Ford Mustang; and similarly, Lee Iacocca pushed the idea through into production. In many ways, the Bronco was a more original concept than the Mustang; whereas the Mustang was based upon the Ford Falcon, the Bronco had a frame, suspension, and a body that were not shared with any other vehicle.

like a great idea.  But when this real-deal Super Sport also has nice investments like a modern A/C, fresh interior, well then you realize something this desirable is rarely within budget.  ", "  This is a very desirable generation for the full-sized Impala.  Chevy revamped the third-gen styling to have a more commanding presence on the streets. Plus, white with plenty of chrome has the kind of ultra-bright presence that make sure people pay attention to this coupe.  Chevy signified the styling direction of the 60s by eliminating the tailfin, and it looks great framed by the iconic six taillight arrangement that was a standout on these cars.  Of course, chrome was king in the '60s, and this one retains all the best factory pieces.  This includes the mirror-like bumpers, a full-width shiny grille, and even the stylized factory wheel covers.  But the brightwork we think you'll enjoy the most is the full-length spear that runs from headlight to taillight.  It has a terrific machine-turned insert that certainly looks the part of an SS car, and it provides a nice bridge to the interior.  ", "  As a real code-14 V8 Super Sport, the interior is an upscale place to do business.  The black vinyl looks great against the exterior white.  As a true SS car, you know that means the comfort of bucket seats and a center console.  Plus, the thin rimmed steering wheel and all the machined aluminum that matches the exterior trim are elements that define 1960s class.  But it might not be the vintage elements that have you the most excited.  This coupe has been given some subtle, but essential, upgrades.  For example, the radio looks like a factory piece, but it's really a retro-style AM/FM digital tuner with an aux input.  That means you can play very modern tunes in this iconic vintage ride.  Plus, you get to stay cool while showing off the cool pillarless hardtop profile because this one is running modern R134a air conditioning.  ", "  A 283 cubic-inch V8 provides reliable, smooth power for the easy-cruising Impala.  Plus, the Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor helps to deliver enough punch to make it fun to drive even in traffic. The engine bay looks great with Chevy Orange paint on the block, polished valve covers, and an old-school performance air topper. This is genuinely meant to be an easy cruiser, and that's why it features a Powerglide automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, and a sway bar on the independent front suspension.  ", "  Here's an iconic V8 Impala SS coupe with all the right comfort upgrades, and it's all available right now for an exceptional price.  We probably don't need to tell you this one will be gone soon.
