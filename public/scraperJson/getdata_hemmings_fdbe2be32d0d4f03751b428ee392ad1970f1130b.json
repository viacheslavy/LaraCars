Admirers came from all walks of life; even Enzo Ferrari referred to it as \u201cthe most beautiful car ever made\u201d. Beneath its gorgeous looks was a revolutionary sports car with rack and pinion steering, fully independent suspension, and four wheel disc brakes with inward rear rotors that matched the already proven performance of the 3.8 litre XK engine. The Series II E-Type was released in 1968 and continued the trend of strong performance mated with an iconic shape. Improvements were plentiful and included an increased grill opening to aid in cooling as well as a more refined interior that still satisfied the sportiest of drivers. All Series II E-types featured the larger 4.2 litre engine; the most discerning owners ordered their cars with the factory options of power steering and air conditioning. An even smaller percentage would go on to order a Series II with the optional 3-speed Borg-Warner fully automatic gearbox that allowed the E-type to glide effortlessly through traffic. The incredibly good looks with proven performance and racing heritage make the E-type one of the most coveted and sought-after British classics today.", "The 1970 Jaguar E-Type Series II 2+2 Coupe featured here is finished in stunning Regency Red with a beautiful black leather interior. This magnificent motorcar has been beautifully restored and comes equipped with many rare and desirable options including a factory automatic transmission, power steering, factory air conditioning, chrome wire wheels and more. It comes fully documented with its original books, service records and Jaguar Heritage Certificate.
