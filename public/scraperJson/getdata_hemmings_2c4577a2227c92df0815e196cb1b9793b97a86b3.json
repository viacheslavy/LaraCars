It had become apparent to most in the company that it was time to begin a new model, but Henry Ford was resistant. With ''luxury'' features coming out such as electric starters in most of General Motors products, newer exterior designs fit to the era they were entering, Ford was forced to compete and began their Model-A design. At first, Henry did not want to worry about looks or features but to spend their energy on the mechanical aspects which had been the primary reason for success on their Model T. Although many improvements with the engine power and overall stability were improved, it proved to be short of what was necessary, a new cosmetic appeal. For this Henry called upon his son, Edsel, who showed how successful it could be with his design. After years of compliments on its curb appeal, Henry started to take credit for it himself although his son was clearly more hands on with this project. The era of mass production had officially passed and the era of ''flexible mass production'' had begun and regardless of who was more responsible for this model, Ford in general showed once again how well they could adapt and stay on top.", "This beautifully restored 1930 Ford Model A Pickup is one of the more rare offerings we have the pleasure to offer for your consideration.
