The window's glass panels are clear and intact. The lights are also clear and crack-free. This limo rides on 235/75R15 whitewall tires at all four corners that surround original factory wheel covers.

Used through 1974, it was designed with potential for 600 CID.", "Inside, the chauffeur's compartment is upholstered in black with black leather seating while on the other side of the power glass divider, the passenger compartment is done in a medium gray Dubonnet cloth. The front bench is in good order, while the spacious gray rear passenger seat, foot rests and accessory jump seats are also in good shape. The horn, HVAC, and fuel gauge are inoperable. The black instrument panel, as wide as many television sets today, looks good. The factory three-spoke steering wheel is present. The inner door panels, mirror glass and shift lever are all in decent condition. Completing the interior is a factory AM radio.", "The Cadillac Series 75 originally replaced the 1935 355E as the company's mainstream car. Although its overall size and character was largely unchanged, the 1969 Cadillac was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like front fender treatment evolved and helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all-new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. Stretched body and trim; Fleetwood emblems and embellishments; doors cut into a formal, high-headroom roof, and generally higher appointment and trim levels continued to mark Cadillac's most luxurious line. Standard equipment included automatic level control, automatic climate control, rear window defogger, four rear ashtrays and 8.20 x 15 four-ply black-wall tires.", "Competition to this Cadillac in 1969 included Lincoln's Continental Limousines, Chrysler's Imperial Limousines and Rolls-Royce's Phantom VI Limousines.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

Here at MotoeXotica Classic Cars, it is wrapped within the form of a 1938 Town Sedan coach worked by Fleetwood, rated by the Classic Car Club of America as a CCCA Full Classic, a designation reserved for only the finest vehicles from 1925-1948. After being treated a complete body-off frame restoration, the car has been driven approximately 4,000 miles since restoration. Cadillac only produced 20 of these V16 town sedans and only a very few still exist today.", "The meticulous comprehensive nut and bolt professional restoration included all aspects of this rarely seen big V16 time machine. Everything was restored from the tidy powder coated frame and underbody to exhaust, brakes, and brake lines. The exterior has a show winning paint job and fresh chrome, the rebuilt V16 motor and components run very smooth. The newly correct reupholstered interior is very handsome and luxurious and the dash is laid out as you should find in a 30's big Cadillac sedan. Cruising in this V16 flagship makes you feel like real royalty!", "Cadillac believed customers demanded a car powered by an engine simultaneously more powerful and smoother than any other available. Development proceeded in great secrecy over the next few years while Cadillac chief Larry Fisher and GM's stylist Harley Earl toured Europe in search of inspiration from Europe's finest coach-builders. Unlike many luxury car builders, who sold bare chassis to be clothed by outside coach-building firms, General Motors had purchased Fleetwood Metal Body and Fisher Body to keep all the business in-house.", "In 2008 or 2009, the then-current owner brought the car, which was still in good overall condition, to Black Knight Restoration in Houston, Texas for rehabilitation as a executive driver. Professional technicians disassembled the vehicle, fixed what did not work then put everything back together in a correct manner.", "Finished in a dark blue, the car's paint and trim, including the elegant \u201cgoddess\u201d hood ornament, are in excellent overall condition. The windows are clear and crack-free and the car's lights, including the foglights perched over the front bumper, are in very good order. The car rides on 7.50-16 wide whitewalls, surrounding factory wheel covers and look great. The car's bumpers shine brilliantly, the engine bay is very tidy and there is a permanently mounted battery tender for long-term storage. Extras include a spotlight on the driver's side and a pair of side-mounted spare tires with body-matching covers.", "Under that hood ornament is a rebuilt, numbers-matching 431 CID L-head 135\u00ba V-16 engine with twin carburetors, twin fuel pumps, twin distributors, twin water pumps, and a nine main bearing crankshaft (compared to the OHV V-16's five bearing crank) and produced the same power as earlier versions of the original V-16 with even greater smoothness and gave the '38\u2013'40 Sixteens the swiftest acceleration of any factory production car in the world at the time, regardless of weight, as well as slightly improved fuel economy over the OHV V-16 cars. This engine was nearly silent at idle and turbine-smooth in operation.", "The car has a positive-ground starting system with two batteries; a six-volt unit under the front passenger seat with another 12-volt unit under the hood for the starter only. It is easier to get the engine to crank with 12 volts, especially after periods of non-use.", "The 1938-1940 431 CID Cadillac V-16 was one of the last new American auto engine designs prior to World War Two. Luxury car drivers of the time valued smoothness and silence more than high-speed power. Hydraulic valve lifters promoted silent running and an absence of periodic adjustment. Unlike most cars of the era, an external oil filter safeguarded the precision valve lifters. Despite the use of side valves, the engine produced as much power as the prior 45-degree V-16, and with much less complexity. The earliest engines produced featured an innovative friction wheel drive to the generator. This was soon replaced by a conventional V belt drive. Cadillac claimed that the 1938, 1939 and 1940 Series 90 Sixteen had the best performance of any production car in the world at the time and would accelerate 10-60 in high gear in only 16 seconds, rapid for the time. Mated to the engine is a rebuilt three-speed synchromesh manual transmission and backed by a 4.31 rear end.", "Inside, the car's Fleetwood Coachwork tan interior is in overall gorgeous condition. The seats, which look more like divans or davenports, are in excellent shape, as is the matching fitted carpet. In the rear are a center-mounted armrest divider, armrest-mounted ashtrays, footrests and a wide fold-down tray to dash off a postcard or have a quick nosh. There are also hooks and rods on which to hang coats, scarves and other outerwear. The headliner is in likewise shape. The metal instrument panel, painted a dark salmon shade, is quite eye-catching and contrasts brilliantly with the tan surroundings. The car's brown metal dash offers full instrumentation and the original, three-spoke steering wheel is present and looks fantastic. The inner door panels, with their beautiful wooden windowsills, present quite well and the mirror glass is in good order, as is the shift lever.", "Competition to this Cadillac in 1938 included V-12 models from Lincoln, Packard, Pierce-Arrow and Rolls-Royce. The only other American manufacturers to field V-16 engines in the 1930s were Marmon and Peerless.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

The paint has been wet-sanded and polished to a bright sheen. The trim is solid but does have some minor blemishes and evident patina, the bumpers shine brilliantly. The car has a new windshield and the other glass panels are clear and crack-free. Similarly, the Cadillac's lights are clear and in great shape, including the optional foglights tucked into the chrome grill and above the Dagmar front bumper. The foglights do double duty as the front turn signals. This Detroit classic rides on new Coker Classic radials with wide whitewalls and factory wheel covers and are in very good order.

The green instrument panel is in very good condition, the dash clock still ticks and the dashboard courtesy lights obediently illuminate when the driver's door opens!

It's mated to a rebuilt Hydramatic automatic transmission. The 331 engine featured a \u201cdry\u201d (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring the use of a tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor and shaft-mounted rockers. The rear bearing carries crankshaft end play. It has the lighter \u2018skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per bearing saddle feeds both cam and crank journals. The lifters are supplied oil through small \u2018bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries.", "A minor facelift and small trim variations were the main Cadillac styling news in 1951. Miniature eggcrate grilles were set into the out-board grille extension panels below the headlights. Larger, bullet shaped style bumper guards were used. The features list included handbrake, warning lamp; key start ignition; steering column cover; Delco-Remy generator; knee-action front suspension; directionals; mechanical fuel pump; dual downdraft carburetor; slipper-type pistons; rubber engine mountings; oversize brakes; Super Cushion tires; one-piece windshield; intake silencer; oil bath air cleaner; equalized manifolding; automatic choke and luxury appointments. On the dashboard \u201cidiot lights\u201d were used to monitor oil pressure and electrical charge rate instead of gauges. The smaller body was once again used on the 61s and again identified by the lack of chrome underscores. However, a new medallion appeared on the rear roof pillar of the Series 61, above the upper beltline molding.", "Competition to this Cadillac in 1951 included Hudson's Hornet H-145, Chrysler's Saratoga, Jaguar's V 3.5L Saloon and Mercury's Sport Sedan with Touch-O-Matic.", "This example won Car of the Year honors at Cars and Coffee Austin in 2016 \u2013 https://www.facebook.com/CarsAndCoffeeAustin/photos/a.233070390180501.1073741829.137201569767384/760891770731691/?type=3&theater", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.
