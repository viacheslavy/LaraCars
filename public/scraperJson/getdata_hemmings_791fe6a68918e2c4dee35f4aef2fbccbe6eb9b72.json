It went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang. The car shared its platform and major components with the Pontiac Firebird, also introduced for 1967.Four distinct generations of the Camaro were developed before production ended in 2002. The nameplate was revived on a concept that evolved into the fifth-generation Camaro; production started on March 16, 2009.The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as a two-door coupe or convertible with 2+2 seating, and a choice of 230 cu in (3.8 L), 250 cu in (4.1 L) inline-6 or 302 cu in (4.9 L), 307 cu in (5.0 L), 327 cu in (5.4 L), 350 cu in (5.7 L), and 396 cu in (6.5 L) V8 powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the Corvair, would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro.The first-generation offered a standard, Super Sport, and Rally Sport editions. In 1967, the Z/28 model was added featuring stripes on the hood and trunk, styled rally road wheels, and a 302 cu in (4.9 L) V8 engine.\"American Dream MachinesAt American Dream Machines, we typically have over 100 quailty classic cars and trucks in stock and for sale.

While that's factory-correct for this car, you can tell by its glossy presentation that there have been investments in this Camaro over the years.  The white is the perfect canvas to add all the bold details.  This includes bright work on the thin wraparound bumpers, velocity-stack style hood, and upgraded Ridler 17-inch wheels.  They add to this Camaro's performance appeal, it's the car's dark side that really intimidates.  The blacked-out SS grille, rear panel, and iconic stinger stripe look terrific.  Because the folding roof is finished in black, this is the kind of drop top that even look great when buttoned up.", "But when you do take the roof down, this classic gets a whole new dimension.  The factory-correct red interior looks fantastic against the white, and it's also the kind of color that adds to any sporty appeal.  So the interior adds another color into the mix, but at the same time, fits in with the car's overall theme.  Bucket seats and a center console is exactly what you want on a high-performance classic.  This sea of red is completed by the carpeting, door panels, and dashboard.  Plus, there's a nice hint of sophisticated wood-like appearance running up the center of the car and on the three-spoke sports steering wheel.   You have all the best driver equipment, including the auxiliary readouts in the center console and a Hurst shifter.  Plus, the SunTach prominently mounted on the steering column is an instant reminder that this is an enhanced machine.", "The moment you pop the hood, everyone can instantly tell this classic Camaro has a very modern heart.  The 5.7-liter LS1 is a terrific fuel-injected V8 that has earned its stripes in everything from Corvettes to GTOs.  It has been correctly installed in the engine bay with all the right supporting components, including an aluminum radiator w/large electric fan and a custom Flowmaster dual exhaust.  Plus, you have complete control over this modern beast and its thunderous soundtrack thanks to the four-speed manual transmission.  We love the look of the upgraded wheels, they also are the key to allowing for better grip with modern performance tires.", "This is the kind of project you would want to do if you had the time.  But instead this Camaro lets you skip to the fun part with the turn-key upgraded droptop.

Looking sharp, running strong and sounding awesome, this vintage Chevy will be a great score for the enthusiast looking to get behind the wheel of true classic that's ready to provide miles and miles of exhilarating driving.", "It didn't take Chevy much time to get their prized project into top form. The first generation of Camaros debuted just a year before this '68 rolled out, and you can see just how this take on the long hood/ short deck lid/ broad track muscle car formula captured the immediate interest of the car buying public. Clad in a magnetic bright red shade with broad black painted stripes running the length of its hood, it's sure to draw attention. The hideaway Rally Sport headlights were a key design element that bore no resemblance at all to what the competition was offering and the deep black background into which they're recessed looks great against the rest of the exterior, as does the cowl hood. The badging on all four sides of this '68 is in good form, the bumpers fore and aft sit level and the cabin is surrounded by clear glass, all of which add to the car's already considerable curb appeal.", "Climb inside and you'll be surrounded by an interior that's been brought into great shape while retaining its original look. Both the low backed front buckets and the rear bench seat don't look like they've seen much action, though some dye work on all four seatbelts will take things to an even higher level. The door panels also look very sharp and cling firmly to their steel frames, and the center console - which features woodgrain accents and a signature group of inclined rectangular gauges up front - presents very well. The dash area has received a thorough refurbishing, or possibly a replacement altogether, and features a shiny, straight and uncracked pad across the top, with very clear gauges in its cluster and every control knob sitting securely in place. Take a look above and you'll see a headliner that's in the very same condition. The trunk area is lined with a fresh gasket to keep the elements out.", "Just underneath the hood, a 350 cubic inch V8 sits in one seriously tidy engine bay, surrounded by nicely routed wiring, fresh hoses and components that look like they've been scrubbed clean. The powerplant carries a 4-barrel carb and an Edelbrock High Rise manifold for some added power, as well as a Chevy-badged chrome air cleaner and chrome valve covers to enhance its looks. The engine is in very good form, pulling with conviction and sending out a great exhaust note while doing so, and pairs with a 4-speed manual transmission to give you full control over this muscle car classic. While its manually-equipped counterparts often offer a compromised driving experience with their notchy, inconsistent clutches, there's no such issue here - the clutch action on this Camaro is smooth and precise. An aluminum radiator sits up front to keep temperatures in check, bracketed by a pair of export braces in the front corners of the engine compartment to add a little more rigidity to the front end. Smooth power steering makes navigation easy, while power brakes at all four corners - with disc brakes up front - provide dependable stops as this Chevy classic turns heads on its 17'' American Racing wheels outfitted with Sumitomo tires.", "If you're looking for a Chevy classic that's road ready and a blast to drive, you have to check out this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro.

Its black backdrop is nice and even, and with a solid clearcoat sitting on top, has a strong shine. Get up close and you won't find anything to diminish your enthusiasm, but you will notice some great details.

The badging has been deleted off the front fenders to allow those flames to really stand out, but the remaining chrome is securely in place - both bumpers are unblemished and level, and some well-focused attention to the rest of the trim can bring the rest of the exterior to top form.", "The black vinyl interior has been refurbished while largely retaining its factory configuration and it exudes some serious vintage muscle car mojo. Both the front buckets and rear bench seat show only very light usage and when you scan the rest of the cabin, everything looks very clean. The door panels and quarter trim in back appear to have been fairly recently installed, and a nice expanse of black carpeting runs the length of the floor. Climb inside and take hold of the custom SS-branded steering wheel and you'll find the original gauges still easily readable in the instrument cluster, joined by a tach mounted on the steering column and a trio of aftermarket gauges sitting at the front of the center console. In-dash vents are on both sides of the dash, and while this classic doesn't currently feature air conditioning, it did at one time and with the plumbing in place you'll be a step ahead should you decide to add it back. Everything looks good in the trunk area - clean fabric lines the floor and everything within view looks solid.", "The theme under the hood centers on exhilarating yet dependable power. The 383 cubic inch stroked V8 sitting at the center of the very clean engine compartment starts easily, packs serious punch and teams with a rock-solid 3-speed automatic TH350 transmission. There's a nice collection of Edelbrock components on hand - a sharp looking air cleaner and valve covers enhance the powerplant's appearance, and a 4-barrel carb and Performer intake take its power game up a few notches. 4-wheel power disc brakes now sit at all four corners for plenty of stopping power and with power steering on board, this vintage Camaro is an easy navigator as it prowls the asphalt on a set of 18'' Eagle wheels - whose black color is a perfect complement to the rest of the car - outfitted with Riken tires.", "This 1968 Chevrolet Camaro is sure to attract attention and is equipped for high-performance action. Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Black", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "17,319"}},

Its silver metallic paint is in very nice form, with smooth texture and just the right amount of flake to add depth and a nice, radiating glow in the sunlight. All of its exterior chrome fittings - including the front and back bumpers, door handles and trim - have received meticulous preparation before being coated in gloss black paint and the result is awesome. All the stylistic inspiration that's been heaped upon it hasn't come at the cost of precision - its doors, hood and deck lid open and shut smoothly and a closer inspection will reveal they're surrounded by nice, even gaps. The prominent scoop on the hood has been well-fabricated and hints at the serious power that lurks beneath it, and the rear spoiler sits well-fitted over the deck lid.", "The black vinyl interior shows the same high standards and attention to detail found on the rest of the car. Up front, race-inspired ProCar bucket seats offer plenty of comfort, coupled with all the support you could want for more inspired driving and they blend nicely with the details of the door panels to each side and the factory-look bench seat in back. Climb in, and you'll feel the siren-like call to grab ahold of the Billet Specialties steering wheel and B&M floor shifter and let this street machine perform its magic. Look above you and you'll notice the headliner is nicely fitted and in great condition. Look below and you'll see an expanse of fresh black carpeting. The straight, fresh-looking dash area is a strong feature on this Camaro, as it's equipped with an assortment of Dakota Digital gauges in its instrument cluster that illuminate the cabin in blue, as well as a retro-style AM/FM radio with an auxiliary port to expand your audio horizons. The trunk area in back is clean and tidy.", "This timeless Chevy classic will flat out perform. At the center of its well-detailed and orderly engine compartment is a 350 cubic inch crate V8 carrying an Edelbrock intake and Quickfuel 4-barrel carb on top that sits underneath an open-element air filter. It's been armed with a pair of aftermarket heads and a performance cam that gives it a nice lope and, having logged just 2000 miles, it's just getting broken in and sounds a great exhaust note out of its Hedman headers into its dual exhausts. It also features a great looking serpentine pulley system and a chrome fuel pump that add even more eye candy. The engine teams with a 3-speed automatic TH350 that's shifting with precision and a 4.11 rear end that equips it with outstanding off the line acceleration. The addition of a nicely-proportioned aluminum radiator with an electric fan will keep temperatures in check during more demanding driving conditions and power disc brakes on all four corners combine with smooth power steering to provide dependable stops and easy navigation. This very impressive Camaro rolls on a set of 18'' show stopping US Mag wheels with chrome perimeters and gun metal gray centers that are wrapped with BF Goodrich G-Force tires.", "You don't often see the combination of exhilarating power and outstanding visual appeal offered by this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro.
