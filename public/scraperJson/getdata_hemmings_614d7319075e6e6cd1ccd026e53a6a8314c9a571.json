More than just performance, this V8 features the right supporting components, like the upgraded pulleys and an aluminum radiator w/electric fan.

Custom extended cab, V8, overdrive, A/C, disc brakes, killer stereo, etc. 100% sorted, fast, and reliable. Everything works and it drives like a modern truck!", "We know The Dude is a love-it-or-hate-it thing. If you're already at \"hate it,\" well, move on and save us your E-mails. But if you appreciate craftsmanship, usability, and a look that says, \"I don't care what the sissies think,\" then The Dude belongs in your garage. You're undoubtedly distracted by the horns on the grille, but take a moment to look the truck over and you'll realize, \"Hey, wait a minute! Chevy never built an extended cab pickup in 1950!\" You may not have noticed immediately because it looks so right\u2014as if the factory DID build them this way 70 years ago. Skillfully lengthened 18 inches, the cab looks right from every single angle\u2014the curve of the roof is uninterrupted, the beltline fits the way it did originally, and the quarter windows have exactly the right shape to follow the contours of the back of the cab. Even better, the frame was lengthened as well, so you have a full-sized pickup box, not some chopped-down mini box that looks weird. The bodywork underneath is done and done right, with super straight sheetmetal that could stand up to a gloss black paint job just as easily. Pinstripes highlight the interesting parts but they're not over-done as you see on many vehicles, and you'll spend an afternoon finding all the trick little details that make The Dude special. A few of the highlights: the aforementioned Texas longhorns on the grille, the cool push bumper designed to resemble those used at Bonneville to get the streamliners rolling, wrenches for door handles, cowboy-themed hooks on the sides of the bed and tailgate, and, of course, the faux tow apparatus, which does indeed have a fully operational electric winch, so it's still useful around the homestead. Those are '59 Cadillac taillights in back and please note that the grille itself was custom-made from tubular steel, but it emulates the original so well that it almost goes unnoticed. They totally nailed the details on this truck.", "The cowboy theme continues inside, and this is probably where the whiners will whine loudest. But spend a little time looking past the Holstein-inspired upholstery (which is durable vinyl) and check out the long list of creature comforts. There's ice cold A/C neatly integrated into a panel under the dash and using vintage-looking guitar amplifier knobs (the builder was a musician of some note) so it has a neat theme going on. That little red lanyard is connected to a remote for the killer AM/FM/CD stereo system, which uses a vintage Fender amplifier box as an enclosure behind the seats, and as I said, the builder is a musician, so you know the sound system is pretty darned good. It's actually very easy to get comfortable in this truck, especially with a foot of extra legroom, and a cross-country drive should be a no-brainer in The Dude. The hardware is right.", "That reliability and performance comes courtesy of a 350 cubic inch GM crate motor under the hood. Turn the key and it starts\u2014every single time. It idles well, hot or cold, A/C or no A/C. And it pulls the truck around with real authority. There's an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor on top, a giant aluminum radiator, HEI distributor, and a powerful alternator that can keep up with the stereo system, as well as a neatly integrated A/C system that works rather well. The wiring is new, there's a custom radiator shroud to make the most of the fan's efforts, and a modern dual master brake cylinder with power assist for the front disc brakes. It has never given us a moment's trouble and thanks to the professional build, it should continue to be bulletproof reliable for years to come.", "The original frame remains under the truck, but it was lengthened and reinforced to handle the extended cab, so no worries about using it as intended. It's plenty stout. The transmission is a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive, so The Dude just loafs along at modern highway speeds, A/C blasting. The front suspension is a custom subframe with A-arms and a fat roll bar, as well as a modern rack-and-pinion setup with low effort so it's easy to handle. A bulletproof 12-bolt rear end seems appropriate on a truck ostensibly designed to do some work, and there are highway-friendly gears inside that work with the overdrive transmission to make this a long-haul cruiser that really does everything well. The lowered stance is just about ideal and it sits on 15-inch wheels with full disc wheel covers to continue that Bonneville Salt Flats vibe, as well as a set of Goodyear Wrangler radials.", "If you can get past the in-your-face look, you'll find there's an extremely well-built, properly engineered machine underneath. It has people lined up three deep around it at every show we attend, and the workmanship stands up to the scrutiny.. If you're the kind of person who colors outside the lines, perhaps the The Dude belongs in your driveway.

LT1 power, 700R4, Vintage Air, 4-wheel disc, killer stereo, leather interior. The best of everything, show-quality throughout, ready to win trophies or drive every day!", "The list of modifications just to the bodywork is extensive, but the big one is the 2/2.5-inch chopped top, which was so skillfully done by noted pro Gene Blackford that you almost don't notice it at first. The workmanship is seamless, the door gaps are even all around the perimeter, and all the glass fits like the factory installed it. Other custom details include shaved door handles, nosed and decked hood, and frenched headlights, plus those custom fender skirts which were also fabricated by Gene. It's worth noting that this truck is 100% steel, including the fenders, so it has a robust feeling that's anything but fragile. Remick Customs did the bodywork in preparation for the custom PPG finish, which involves a base coat called Blue Heaven and another five hues to create the incredible flame job across the nose. The finishing touch was some subtle pinstripe work by Matt Smith of 840 Graphics\u2014just enough to accentuate the custom without becoming overbearing.", "Of course, it goes without saying that all the chrome and stainless trim is new, including the grille bars and bumpers, the truck-style side mirrors, and those cool little LED taillights perched on chrome stanchions. The bed was finished with stunning wood planks stained blue so they almost match the bodywork, an incredible feat that took about 40 hours and a dozen different test samples to get everything just right. Obviously, they weren't cutting corners on this build.", "The interior doesn't stray far from the original, and includes the factory bench seat, now covered in beautiful red leather with matching door panels. Dark blue carpets prevent it from being red overload and the dash was painted to match the bodywork with more of Matt Smith's gorgeous pinstripes. The gauges are custom pieces made just for this truck by Beede, and they slot neatly into the original round pods so they almost look like they were born there. Controls for the Vintage Air A/C system and the Kenwood AM/FM/CD stereo (with remote) are all neatly stashed in the glove box, along with a 12V power point for your phone (after all, this truck was designed to be a daily driver). Speakers were hidden throughout the cab so it sounds great and the A/C blows ice cold for easy cruising. You'll also note a beautifully fitted red headliner and new weather seals throughout, making this truck feel tight and solid as it goes down the road.", "Don't be fooled by the air cleaner (which is from a 1954 Cadillac), that's a fuel-injected Corvette LT1 V8 under the hood. The air cleaner is fully functional and uses a custom polished aluminum duct to feed filtered air to the front-mounted throttle body, a neat piece of work. At a glance, you can see they worked hard to hide the wiring and plumbing, and anything that wasn't color-matched to the bodywork was polished or chrome plated. There's a giant aluminum radiator up front with a beautiful fabricated aluminum shroud for the electric fan, so it never gets fussy on hot days, and the serpentine belt drive system features polished aluminum accessories. Turn the key and it fires instantly, idles properly, and pulls with the ferocity of 300 Corvette-bred horsepower. The LT1 is legendary for its durability, so don't be afraid to take it for a spin or make it your daily driver, it'll last practically forever.", "It's obviously built for cruising because there's a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, which makes for effortless high-speed motoring and reasonable fuel economy thanks to the fuel-injected motor. The front suspension is a custom Mustang II setup with tubular A-arms and coil-over shocks, while the rear suspension is the usual leaf springs and a Currie Enterprises 9-inch rear full of 3.55 gears. The custom 3-inch exhaust system is stainless, but it was fully wrapped from front to rear to control heat and the look really stands out from the usual shiny stuff everyone else uses. 4-wheel power disc brakes give it stopping power equal to the Corvette's go power and it sits on 15-inch steel wheels with smoothie hubcaps, trim rings, and staggered Goodyear wide whitewall radials.", "There are plenty of custom 3100s running around, and if garden-variety is OK with you, well, go ahead and buy one of those. But if you want what is flat-out the finest custom pickup we've ever seen and one of the best customs of any kind that has ever come through our shop, this is it. There are no demerits, no excuses, and no asterisks with this truck. It is ready to continue collecting trophies at almost any level and it drives like a real truck, not a piece of static art.

There is so much to like about this completely restored Chevrolet 3100; most especially the price. You would be hard pressed to find another 1950 5-Window restored to this quality and that runs as smooth and strong as this one at this price point.This classic pick-up truck has been owned by the same family since 2000 when the 235 I6 engine was rebuilt. A dual carburetor was also installed at that time. It has a polished aluminum manifold cover/side plate.  As you can hear and see in the video this 3100 has a strong running engine that rides smooth in every gear.One of the best reasons to seriously consider purchasing this 1950 Chevrolet 3100 is the eye-catching exterior. It was painted in a satin-gloss mahogany bronze in 2003. To accent its appeal there is a subtle yet very alluring set of flames painted on each side of the front end. Most importantly there are no noticeable scratches or dents on the exterior. Just as high quality as the exterior the interior is also show-car quality - clean with no noticeable scratches stains tears or odors.In short you have every reason to inquire further about this 1950 Chevrolet 3100 Five-Window by viewing it in greater detail including HD pictures and an HD video of the car running and driving at our website - http://www.gatewayclassiccars.com.
