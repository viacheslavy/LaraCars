So when you take one of these sleek machines, and give it a frame-off restoration with modern silver paint, a bold red leather interior, and a powerful 460 big block V8... you're looking at one of those rare turn-key classics that has style AND substance.", "The 1969 Mustang is often the sought-after design.  It carries much of the original icon's appearance, but many features are elongated to give it a more muscular presence on the streets.  This one definitely goes for the meaner end of the pony car crowd as the full-length dual black stripes coordinate very well with the blacked-out grille and rear spoiler.  Plus, the hood pins and hood scoop are big hints at the power lurking underneath... but more on that in a moment.  The restoration on this coupe happened in 2014, and that means the silver paint retains a terrific presence in the sunshine.  It highlights all the crisp angles in the sheetmetal.  Plus, it's a nice complementing color to the mirror-like the bumpers and the complete trim.  Finishing off this silver presence is a set of modern 18-inch alloys that remind us of the Ford GT supercar.", "Inside, the investment in a quality restoration is instantly apparent the moment you lay eyes on those red leather seats.   This sets off a well-coordinated package that includes new door panels with red inserts and a new dash pad with custom red stitching.  This premium feeling continues on the center console with arm rest and bright gear selector.   But this car is more than a coddler, and you know that from the moment you grab the sporty smaller diameter steering wheel.  And with those Dakota Digital gauges glowing red, you can really tell this modified Mustang is out for blood.", "Under the hood this V8 has a great black, red, and chrome presentation seen throughout the rest of car.  But more than look clean and mean, those 460 callouts on the valve covers aren't lying.  The restoration budget included a excellent upgrade to serious big block muscle.  For most people a 460 cubic-inch V8 would be plenty of power, but this one doesn't just stop there.  It has go-fast goodies like a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Weiand intake, MSD ignition, aluminum radiator, and a header package that not only adds power, but also contributes to the rumble of the dual exhaust.  Out on the road, this wild pony is easy to keep in control thanks to a three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, front disc brakes, an upgraded coilover rear suspension, and the grip of modern Nitto Extreme ZR tires.", "The build receipts will show you how much quality work went into this custom Mustang.  And so when you see the obtainable price, you understand just how much of an outstanding deal this big V8 pony is.  But value like this never waits for long.

This is the midpoint in the first generation where everything was given some sleeker and longer design elements, but it's still instantly recognizable as an original pony car.  You see it in the deeper C-channel along the profile and the concave tail panel.  And more than just that year's styling makes this one a standout.  For example, the black vinyl roof is the perfect way to signal period-correct premium.  Plus, the fog lights and GT wheel covers are great sporty touches that we all recognize.  And we especially like this car's story.  If you look at the trim tag, this has a sales district of DSO 22 \u2013 that's Charlotte, NC.  So over half a century later, and this car is still being sold out of its hometown area.", "Inside, the black vinyl bucket seats do a great job with matching the exterior roof.  It looks great and retains the nice ribbed pattern that's repeated in the back seat and on the door panels. The driver gets the improved round gauge package that came on later versions of the first-gen Mustangs, and ahead of that, we are delighted to see no one has traded the original premium steering wheel for an aftermarket unit. The whole interior follows this car's period-correct and premium feelings.  In fact, the only major component that did not come from the factory is the AM/FM radio.  This upgrade to a more versatile digital tuner and iPod input blends nicely into the original knob-style radio opening.", "This is a C-code Mustang, and so you get Ford's 289 cubic-inch V8 under the hood.  It looks nice with the fined valve covers and long Cobra-style air toper.  But more than just sporty, it runs with an extra kick of performance thanks to and Edelbrock Performer 289 intake and Holley four-barrel carburetor.  There's a nice deep sound out of the dual exhaust that will make this Mustang a great cruise-in friend.  And that feeling is backed up with easy driving features like the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes.", "A complete and distinct icon like this will always be in demand.
