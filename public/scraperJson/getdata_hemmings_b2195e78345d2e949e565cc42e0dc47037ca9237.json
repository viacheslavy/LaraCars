It's a real C-code 289 V8 car, it's got the right colors, and it's available for about the price of a garden-variety daily driver. Wouldn't you rather have the Mustang?", "Go to a show today and you might be convinced that the roads were teeming with Shelbys and Mach 1s, but the truth is, this coupe is far more accessible and looks much more like what people were driving in 1967. The handsome Springtime Yellow paint is certainly eye-catching, and there aren't many folks alive today who don't crack a smile when they see an early Mustang like this. Obviously kept in a warm, dry climate, this super-straight old pony wears that burgundy paint in a subtle way, so it makes a statement without the need for spoilers, which always seem to get in the way of the Mustang's clean, honest look. Good panel alignment certainly helps and 1967's quarter panel inserts are far more interesting than the early cars' plain ones. The black stripe along the rockers is recent and it works rather well with the black vinyl top, which is likewise in great shape. We like the look because it combines an elegant, upscale image with just enough street fighter to make everyone respect it on the road.", "Mustangs were always equipped with wonderful, stylish, highly functional interiors, and this coupe is no exception. Bucket seats were standard (yes, you could get a bench in a Mustang, but why?) but these are aftermarket units that are far more supportive and aggressively bolstered than the originals. There's a big three-spoke steering wheel that works well in the Mustang's updated driver's compartment and it gives you great road feel. Round gauges covering the basics fill the dash and are probably original, the factory A/C still blows cold, and the shifter has a wooden handle that helps with the upscale vibe. The door panels, carpets, and headliner are all in good shape, and for entertainment it features a Sony AM/FM/CD stereo head unit. The trunk is neatly finished with a correct plaid mat as well as a spare tire with its own matching cover.", "Yes, this is a real c-code 289/2-barrel car and it sticks to the original recipe for reliability and ease of maintenance. It's detailed with bright Ford Blue engine enamel and simple stamped valve covers but a chrome air cleaner gives it a bit of a racy look. The A/C compressor dominates the engine bay, but underneath it, you'll spot factory power steering that makes this pony a car you could drive every day. The C4 3-speed automatic transmission offers crisp shifting and someone has just added a brand new dual exhaust system in place of the original single exhaust, and the soundtrack is much better now. The front suspension is stock, but that's OK because it works well, and the floors are in good order. Period Cragar mags are a great addition, looking sporty without being too modern, and they're fitted with a recent set of blackwall radials.", "Easy to live with, fun to drive, and affordable to buy, that's how the Mustang has always been great.

The presentation is not perfect, but don't be surprised if this is the one to draw the true enthusiasts at events.

The right details are still in place like the deluxe steering wheel; the heat/defrost sliders still work; and even the factory AM radio is still cranking out tunes.  The revised '67 gauge panel still shows large and clear readouts, so this survivor is also easy to enjoy out on the road.", "Lift hood for more great originality.  It's a correct 289 cubic-inch V8 that has resisted any shiny add-ons.  Instead, you get the correct bold blue presentation of the block, valve covers, and air topper.  While the preserved presentation means most people will never even have to ask if its original, the date code on this V8 puts it so close that it's hard to imagine any other V8 ever being in this engine bay.  Plus, this one has the optional and desirable A-code 289, and it still wears a Holley four-barrel carb today! Because this is a cared for survivor, the V8 fires up easily and feels smooth out on the road.  Plus, with three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes, this is a great cruiser.", "You're looking at the perfect time capsule that can be easily shown off everywhere.
