With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

You are bidding on my 1965 Ford Mustang Fastback that is a TRUE factoryGT. Why is this important? The GT package is one of the most desired factoryoption packages, and since Ford introduced it late in the 1965 model yearit's relatively rare. It's believed that only about 2% of the totalproduction (all body styles) during the 1965 model year (which ran from April1964 to August 1965) are Factory GTs. Because of this rarity, and theoutstanding look of the package, you will see a TON of GT clones / tribute cars- coming across a true factory GT is a rare opportunity.
