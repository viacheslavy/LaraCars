That means Cobra enthusiasts don't have to look very hard to find a great variety of aftermarket support, and that makes it pretty easy to build a roadster any way they like it. The problem then becomes the amount of time and money that such a massive undertaking requires. After spending years writing check after check to shop after shop, the enthusiast finally gets to enjoy a car that, by that point in time, they might not even want. Fortunately, there is a better solution! Why not let your friends at RK Motors Charlotte sell you a top-notch, turn-key custom like this killer Superformance MKIII for half the price, and a fraction of the time, of building it yourself?", "BODYWORK/TRIM", "As the only Shelby licensed replica of the original 1965 Cobra, this roadster's sublime Superformance body utilizes high quality, hand laminated fiberglass to create a rock-solid drop-top that provides a first-rate driving experience. Those stiffly reinforced panels, titled as a Special Construction Cobra in 2006, feature the smooth surfaces and typically tight gaps we've come to expect from top tier Cobra replicas. And that excellent fit and finish is a testament to both OEM-quality and a series of talented technicians. Those excellent aesthetics found glossy Indigo Blue Metallic 2-stage under Metallic Charcoal racing stripes. And overall, this Shelby's timeless combination of killer style, serious performance and contemporary build techniques creates an irresistible curve carver that'll keep onlookers marveling!", "Detailing is crucial on a replica because that's where a lot of cars start to disappoint. Fortunately, you can tell the overall impression of one of these classics from about five feet away. And naturally, this Cobra hits all the right visuals! At the front of the car, an aggressive nose hangs chrome-trimmed headlights over mesh grilles, tinted, bullet-style parking lamps and polished quick lifts. A small hood anchors a riveted scoop in front of locking latches, polished wipers and tinted visors. Behind that hood, a full canvas top hangs Lexan side windows between a ''Superformance'' branded windshield, clear wind wings and a polished roll bar. At the sides of the car, coated pipes frame a Monza-style fuel filler and polished heat extractors. And at the back of the car, chrome-trimmed tail lamps combine with a chrome tag light to illuminate a locking trunk handle and two more polished quick lifts.", "ENGINE", "Tilt this roadster's lightweight hood and you'll find a hot Roush Performance 427 R small block that twists a heady 550 horsepower into 535 lb./ft. of tire-killing torque! Built from the ground up as your ticket to major acceleration and insane speed, this stout mill is founded on an iron block, a steel crank, a roller cam, H-beam connecting rods and forged aluminum pistons. At the top of the surly engine, a Roush-branded air cleaner floats a reusable filter element above a coated Proform carburetor. That carb feeds an Edelbrock Victor Jr. intake, which is seated between lightweight aluminum heads. Those CNC-massaged caps hide tough hydraulic roller lifters under a polished, Cobra-branded breather and trick Roush valve covers. Fire is provided by an MSD Blaster 2 coil, which is connected to an MSD distributor and loomed Ford Racing plug wires. Cooling comes courtesy of a shrouded radiator, which fronts dual electric puller fans and a polished expansion tank. Ceramic-coated headers evacuate spent gases in to the aforementioned side-pipes. At the front of the block, billet pulleys spin a fresh alternator opposite modern power steering. And the dyno-tuned engine features a roster of well-planned details, including a polished fuel pump, braided fuel lines and a quality Weiand water pump.", "DRIVETRAIN/SUSPENSION", "One of the best things about buying any high quality replica is the modern hardware underneath. Fully sorted and ready to roll, this roadster's Superformance heavy wall Jig-welded frame and fully independent suspension are poised to challenge the toughest turns you can find! At the center of those bones, a rugged Tremec 5-speed twists a tough Dana third member. Turns come courtesy of manual rack-and-pinion steering. Solid stops are provided by power-assisted Wilwood calipers, which clamp four vented discs. Torque meets the tarmac through alloy knock-offs, which twist 255/60R15 Yokohama Avid S/Ts in front of 295/50R15 Yokohama Avid S/Ts. And details like braided lines and a deep-sump oil pan round out an otherwise impressive build.", "INTERIOR", "Cobra interiors have always been stylish and simple, and one look inside this roadster reveals just how serious the car's aspirations are when it comes to being driver-focused. Buff bucket seats wear tight leather hides. In front of those seats, a Cobra-branded dash hangs a clean combination of Smiths and Auto Meter gauges beside a locking glovebox that features a familiar Carroll Shelby signature. At the sides of that dash, lightweight doors found polished poppers behind simple panels. Below those doors, clean carpet centers a booted e-brake and polished shifter between a polished fire extinguisher and colorful Superformance floor mats. The driver feels the asphalt through a polished steering wheel, which twists a leather-wrapped rim. And the passenger stows cargo in a fully finished trunk.", "OUR SALE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ACCESSORIES", "A vinyl cockpit cover", "Well assembled, thrilling to drive and ready to deliver the ride of your life, this Cobra is sure to satisfy anyone who has a pulse.

Frank Kurtis is a very well-known builder of race cars. His infatuation with automobiles began at an early age. His father owned a blacksmith shop located in Pueblo, Colorado, that repaired automobiles and horse-and-buggies. The family later moved to Los Angeles, where Frank began designing, building, and repairing racers in a four-car garage behind their home. During the 1940?s, Kurtis fostered a reputation for his midget and Indy racers.   In 1946, the Kurtis Miller Ross Page Special had been created, and was ready to compete in the first Indy 500 since World War II. By 1947 he had created the Kurtis-Kraft Special, his personal entrant in the 1948 Indy race. George Shilala was plant foreman at the Kurtis-Kraft plant between 1945 and 1953, when he left to start his own company. The chassis that Shilala produced for this car was virtually identical to the stock Kurtis-Kraft chassis, with only subtle differences. It is believed that this car was driven by Johnny Rutherford in 1963, during the early part of his career.   This example is powered by a Ford 134 CI inline 4-cylinder engine mated to a direct drive box. The Norden steering gear is dated 6-4-62. Firestone tires are mounted on all 4 knock off wheels.  \rVehicle titled as:", "Auction"]}},

The project was considered to be an exercise in engineering and styling using a \"no holds barred\" approach.  GDT stands for Gene Dickinson Team.  Gene led the design, fabrication and finance for the GDT Speedster project.   The car features a custom fabricated chassis that is nearly 50% stiffer than a Corvette, aggressive styling, a steeply raked windscreen and \"clam shell\" front and rear body panels.  It has a full leather interior with custom dash and gauges, custom exhaust system, and one of a kind Fiske forged alloy wheels produced for this car. It took 6 years and 13,000 man hours to complete.  There was a book written that documents the build titled \"GDT Speedster, from Dream to Reality\" that is still available.  A Chevrolet 5.7L V-8 supplies the power to a 4-speed automatic transmission.  There is plenty of stopping power thanks to the 4-wheel disc brakes.  The custom Fiske wheels are wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport tires.  This is a one of one car.  Included in the sale is the original clay scale model used in development of this vehicle.
