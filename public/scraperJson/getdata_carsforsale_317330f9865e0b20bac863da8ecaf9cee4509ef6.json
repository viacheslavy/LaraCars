This nasty satin black Cobra is beautifully finished with a snarling fuel-injected V8, combat-ready interior, and a lot of upgrades that make it the total package.  ", "  You really can't go wrong with basic black, but knock the shine off it and suddenly you have something that looks ready to fight on the most primitive levels. Even if you have an original Cobra, people are still going to think it's a replica, so if you're building one like this, you may as well give it a paint job that will get it noticed by everyone, not just the purists. Fortunately, Factory 5's workmanship is consistently excellent, and the composite body was prepped and smoothed to the standards that black demands. Panel fit is quite good, particularly the hood and trunk, and with that satin black paint, there's no place for bad workmanship to hide. The gloss black stripes were expertly painted in place, making it so that you only notice them when you're up close, and reminding you that this car is finished, not a work-in-progress. Twin black roll hoops, shiny jacking stubs fore and aft, and matching black side pipes all make this Cobra stand out, adding to the race-ready appearance. Also note the extra details like the flip-up gas cap, subtle hood scoop, and correct Lucas-style taillights that all help make it stand out.  ", "  The interior sticks to the basics with wrap-around low-back buckets flanking a wide center tunnel. That stubby shifter is very much like the original, and it's linked directly to the 5-speed manual gearbox that's one of the best-shifting transmissions ever invented. The instrument panel has been wrapped in matching black leather and stuffed full of Auto Meter gauges that look right in the 1965 surroundings. A wood-rimmed steering wheel lends the right amount of old world charm to the snake's driving environment, and you'll appreciate thoughtful details like twin cup holders, leather check straps on the doors, and 5-point Simpson harnesses for both driver and passenger. There's no stereo (are you kidding? Who needs it?) but it's comfortable enough if your goal is going fast. There's also a neatly finished trunk with ample space for your gear on the road or at the track.  ", "  The Factory 5 Cobra is built on the massive 5.0 Mustang market, so this one packs a fuel-injected 5.0 that's got enough power to make it worthy of the Cobra name. The lightweight Cobra makes the most of the relatively stock motor's power, and it still feels like a rocket ship when you get on it, but it also idles smoothly and gets surprisingly good fuel economy. A Cobra dress-up kit with blacked-out details and red valve covers gives it a proper 1960s vibe, and there's a giant aluminum radiator with electric fan up front. Underneath, it has a tubular chassis just like the original, manual rack-and-pinion steering for maximum "], "title": "1965 Shelby Cobra ", "total_results": "21921", "price": "39995", "kilometers": 9441.612, "total_pages": 915, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/25493557", "brand": "Shelby", "reference_id": "25493557", "year": "1965", "model": "Cobra", "specs": {"Engine": "5.0 Liter V8", "Mileage": "5,868 miles", "Exterior Color": "Black", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

It combines a great-running small block V8 with plenty of style and a touch of practicality to make a car that you'll never get tired of driving and looks far more expensive than it is.  ", "  The original color was code 55 Champagne Gold, but at some point this car got a makeover in handsome Burgundy livery, which seems to suit it just fine. A cowl induction hood, black SS stripes, and exceptionally tight gaps are the kinds of things that car guys notice and appreciate, and at this price it looks decent and has an elegant look that's missing on a lot of Elkys. No, it's not perfect and it's been driven and used, but there's no denying the appeal. The bed has been coated with a spray-in bedliner that makes it practical and durable for the things you want to do with a pickup truck, so this truck/car should be an easy sell to your significant other, too. Proper SS badges, a blacked-out grille, and hood pins reinforce the muscle car part of the Elky's DNA, and the whole thing has an appealing look. Even the black vinyl top helps make it look elegant in a way that makes it seem as though other El Caminos are under-dressed.   ", "  Black cloth and vinyl upholstery is a nice upgrade from plain vinyl and bucket seats with a console are always a great choice in an El Camino. From behind the wheel, it's almost impossible to tell that you're not in a Chevelle, with a four-spoke Grant GT steering wheel, driver-oriented dashboard, and the view over that cowl-induction hood. Instrumentation is SS-spec, with a full complement of dials that include a factory tach and a vacuum gauge down on the console. An AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit, factory A/C, and a tilt steering column also make this a great car for road trips or even just a trip down to the local cruise night, where it's sure to be a hit.  ", "  A smart-running 400 cubic inch small block V8 lives under that cowl-induction hood and makes this El Camino feel every bit as muscular as it looks. A few dress-up pieces make it look good, including a chrome air cleaner and Z/28-sytle finned valve covers. There's obviously a lot of recent work under the hood, including new belts and hoses, a recent alternator, and some fresh wiring. The dual exhaust system uses ubiquitous Flowmaster mufflers, so it has that traditional muscle car sound that everyone wants. A rugged TH400 3-speed automatic transmission feeds a 12-bolt rear end ignores abuse and is filled with highway-friendly, so it's an easy cruiser. You'll note that the floors are clean, there are a lot of new front-end components, and long-tube headers feed a new Flowmaster dual exhaust system. Flashy Rally wheels with spinners look great on the El Camino and carry staggered 215/70/15 front and 225/70/15 rear Goodyear radials that fit inside the wheel wells just right.

Powered by the original 350 cubic inch V8 engine and shifted via a 3-speed automatic transmission, this \u00c3\u00a2??Vette was made to cruise!  The Collector Edition has a special paint code, only available on this edition.  It also gave special badges, and a special decal package to set it apart from the standard \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvettes.  With just over 40,000 original pampered miles, there are still plenty of roads left to be travelled on this classic Corvette.  The original interior looks like it has only been used a handful of times and shows minimal wear for a vehicle this age.  The \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvette was the last model in a long run of the C3 chassis, and was a clean break before the C4 chassis, as there was no Corvette in model year \u00c3\u00a2??83.  The \u00c3\u00a2??82 model carried the classic design, and started integrating more and more technology until an entirely new chassis had to be designed to take full advantage of what Chevrolet had planned for the Corvette.  This example is sporting the Crossfire injection system.  The interior has a very \u00c3\u00a2??disco\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d feel; there is plenty of leather, a slick gradient pattern on the door panels and arm rest, and the signature laid-back seats that any self-respecting sports car would have.  Options on this \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvette include: Air-Conditioning, AM/FM/Cassette, T-Tops, Cruise Control Power Brakes, Power Steering, Power Locks, Power Seats, Power Windows, Tilt/Telescopic Wheel, Seat Belts, Leather Interior, Radial Tires with Raised White Letters, and Alloy Wheels.
