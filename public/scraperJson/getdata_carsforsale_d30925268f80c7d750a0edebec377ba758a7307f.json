The fastback rear styling was not a hatchback, but allowed for more luggage space behind the seats. The luggage area was significantly larger and included a retractable cover that added security and sun protection. This model year also added a glove box, new armrests, new inner door panels, a redesigned speedometer and tach, and wiper and washer controls were moved back to the instrument panel. This particular Corvette has the L82 engine, a 350 with 220hp, an upgrade to the 350/185hp that was standard. Most of this car is totally original to the car-including the paint. It has 43K actual miles, and must have been kept in the garage, because it is in excellent condition for its age.

But when you take a closer look and see the extra power, sound, and presence of this example, you realize you're getting something special at a very affordable price.  ", "  1978 was the first year of the C3 fastback styling, and combined with the two-tone paint, the results were a hit that goes far beyond just coordinating two handsome colors. It adds delicate pinstriping in all the right places, including extra ones to highlight the C3's curvy styling along the power bulge in the hood and the Coke bottle fenders. It looks like a custom paintjob, which is why it has remained one of the most sophisticated themes every applied by General Motors. In fact, what makes this coupe so cool is that the silver theme went well beyond the paintjob.  The factory wheels almost make this look like a three-tone silver on the car, and real enthusiasts flock to see the shiny 25th anniversary badge on the hood. But all of this is what the factory applied in '78.  You might have noticed one more shiny silver element on this car's profile that makes it quite distinguished (but we'll discuss more on that in a moment.)  ", "  Many of these anniversary editions came with a silver interior.  That is a cool presentation, but this Corvette has a more aggressive heart.  So that's why we love seeing it in a more muscle car friendly black.  The deep dark appearance is on the seats, carpets, door panels, center console, and dash for a true uniform appearance.  And you can share it with the world whenever you want to take out the tight-fitting T-tops.  With a wind-in-your-hair 'Vette like this, it feels great to just to sit down and grab the three-spoke steering wheel with your left hand and gear stick with your right.  You have the large speedo and tach directly in front of you, and there are all the auxiliary gauges you'll need sitting prominently in the center.  This is already a great sports car, but if you desire creature comforts, it's also easy to oblige with provisions for air conditioning, power windows, and even a new Autosound receiver comes with the sale.  ", "  Under the hood is a GM Goodwrench 350 cubic-inch V8 with a four-barrel carburetor.  These crate motors are famous for being the forerunners to the Chevy Performance motors available today, and so they offer an extra kick of power even over the emissions regulated L-82 that was the top dog the factory installed.  But it's more than just the added muscle in the V8.  The long tube headers feed those bold side pipes.  The side exit exhaust is part of the Corvette tradition, so we're quite happy to see it added to this 25th anniversary model.  And of course, they give this C3 a wicked sound that everyone will recognize as pure power.  Plus, the TH350 three-speed automatic is always able to handle the extra muscle the enhanced V8 c"], "title": "1978 Chevrolet Corvette ", "total_results": "422", "price": "12995", "kilometers": 156879.109, "total_pages": 19, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27244694", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "27244694", "year": "1978", "model": "Corvette", "specs": {"Engine": "350 V8", "Mileage": "97,501 miles", "Exterior Color": "Light Silver", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
