This Camaro has the factory RS package along with the SS hood.  Everything is covered in the correct white with the Blue pinstripes and all the Pace Car stickers.  All the glass looks good as well as the seals and weather stripping.  Also, it has the factory dual mirrors.  The final exterior touch is the Rally Wheels and the Red Line Tires.", "Next, we will take a look at the interior of the Camaro.  Everything on the inside is done to be correct.  It has the blue deluxe seat covers and door panels.  When you look at the dash it has the factory Am radio and the Rose Wood Wheel.  This Convertible has the factory seat belts as well.  The interior as a whole is in very good condition down to the carpet.", "Finally, we will take a look at the heartbeat of the Chevy.  Under the it's powered by a 1970 model 396/375HP engine that has the snow flake Aluminum Intake with factory style chrome valve covers and breather.  It's mated to an Automatic Trans and a 12 Bolt Rear End.  It has Power Steering and Power Disc Brakes.  The exhaust runs through a set of stock manifolds and dual exhaust.  When you look under this Camaro the floors and sub frame are rock solid with no visible signs of rust or rot.", "This is a car that you don't find every day.

In all respects, it's at the top of its game and will greet its next lucky owner with the promise of countless fun-filled miles ahead, and a collection of build receipts to document the transition to its current stellar condition.", "With just a glance you can see a lot of cool features that set this Chevy apart from the other muscle cars of its era: its silver metallic hue is in great shape, the pair of stripes that run the length of its hood and deck lid sport very sharp edges, the double deep split front grille combines with an aggressive hood scoop to hint at the power lurking in the engine bay, and its array of chrome that would stand out in any crowd. A few years before this '70 took its first bow, Chevy had already made quite an impression among performance car enthusiasts when they introduced the Camaro as their entrant in the ever-escalating muscle car war, and this specimen, with its wider stance and more aerodynamic profile, was their well-conceived reiteration. A thorough restoration brings it to the present in fine form - its finish ably matches all its flash and you'll find all the completing touches in place, including precise body panel alignment, sharp and vibrant badging and clear glass on all four sides. This is one capable-looking muscle car.", "The black vinyl interior has been left in largely original configuration, but sports a few welcome upgrades. Both the front buckets and rear bench seat have been refurbished with the stock Camaro look of the era and are very well-padded and comfortable, and the signature T-handle on the elevated B&M shifter beckons you to grab ahold and put this Chevy through its paces. Just beyond the stock steering wheel, you'll find the dash area is in great shape, with a full complement of AutoMeter analog gauges sitting in the instrument cluster and looking very much at home to provide accuracy beyond the reach of their original counterparts. A trio of vents stand by to bring cool air into the cabin, along with an AM/FM/CD system to attend to your audio needs. The trunk area in back is looking sharp, and with no lining on its floor, you can see how well-prepped and precisely aligned its components are -it couldn't have looked any cleaner than this when this Chevy first rolled off the assembly line.", "There's one seriously impressive engine compartment underneath the scooped hood, with a built fuel injected 6.2 liter LS-1 V8 sitting front and center to supply all the power you could want. The LS-1 has been bored out from its original specs and includes ProComp heads, Speed Pro pistons/rings, Howard Racing cam and a ton of other new parts (ask for the spec sheet), so it definitely delivers. It pairs with a 4-speed 4L60e transmission with an overdrive gear to keep highway speed RPMs nice and low. Despite all its muscle, this Camaro is no mere straight-line barbarian - it's got power disc brakes at all four corners for dependable, fade-resistant stops, and its precise power steering makes navigation nice and easy. This impressively restored second generation cuts quite an impressive figure as it patrols the roads on a set of Foose wheels - 18'' in front and 20'' in back, wrapped with Hankook Ventus Sport tires.", "This 1970 Chevrolet Camaro restomod ushered motoring excitement into a new decade when it was first introduced and now, still looking and running strong, it's ready to bring that same excitement to your garage.

This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS 396 Tribute scores big on both accounts - it carries a clean-looking, aggressive exterior for maximum visual impact and harbors a strong running big block underneath its hood, with more than enough power to knock you back in your seat.", "The Camaro wasn't Chevy's first entry into the muscle car wars, but when it was introduced the year before this one came out, notice was served to competitors that there would be no ground conceded to anyone in terms of style or power. This '68 is fortunate to benefit from the best upgraded aspects of both the Rally Sport and Super Sport packages offered at the time of its release - its hidden headlights, sitting against the textured black grille, have to be one of the coolest looks in all of the muscle car realm and you'll find a pair of chrome scoops on the hood and SS badging on all four sides that really pop against their jet black background. The broad stripe running the width of the nose and along the sides provides a nice contrast and it's no mere decal \u2013 it's painted on, with a nice consistent color and edges that are impressively sharp. Take a lap around this street machine and you'll appreciate the precision of its body alignment - it's got tight and consistent gaps between panels and doors that sit flush and open easily.", "Chevy's houndstooth checked upholstery conferred a special edition status on its muscle cars of the era, and you'll find it on display here on front bucket and rear bench seating that virtually calls out to you to climb in and get behind the wheel. As you do so, you'll find yourself in the midst of one seriously compelling interior that remains largely in its original configuration, yet sports a consistently fresh appearance. The center console running between the buckets features a fresh looking woodgrain insert and harbors another one of Chevy's unmistakable styling cues - its signature horseshoe shifter. The dash area is crowned by a fresh-looking dash pad, and the stock gauges in its instrument cluster sit behind crystal clear lenses. You'll find a JVC AM/FM/CD player with USB and Auxiliary ports positioned at the center, and a trio of in-dash vents stand ready to bring air-conditioned air into the cabin. The trunk area in back has been well-prepped to deal with the elements and with no liner in place, you can see just how precisely its inner wheelhouses merge with the trunk floor.", "A 396-cubic inch V8 sits inside the very clean engine bay, dressed with an open-element Chevy air cleaner and branded valve covers to enhance its look, and a pair of aftermarket heads and 4-barrel carb for added power. It's in great form - starting up promptly, pulling with all the brute force you could want and sounding great while doing so. It teams with a 3-speed automatic transmission, smooth power steering and power brakes at all four corners to create a driving experience you'll want to be part of every chance you get. This skillfully restored Chevy classic sits on a set of 15'' Centerline wheels outfitted with Firehawk GT tires in front and Firehawk Indy 500 tires in back.", "This 1968 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS 396 Tribute offers an outstanding blend of exhilarating power and magnetic curb appeal.

What powers this one? A bad to the bone 383 CID V8 stroker engine mated to a smooth and easy driving 4-speed automatic transmission. This one is finished in an excellent red color with white touches and features a red interior. One of the worst parts about classic cars is the heat. Many older cars never had air conditioning. This is a Texas car which means it is probably one of the most valuable additions a driver here could ask for. This one has A/C to keep you cool on those hot days! It also features all aluminum heads for better flow into the engine and a roller cam for increased power and efficiency. The car has a 3500-stall converter which will help getting this monster off the line when you\"??re staged at the red lights on Friday night! Included with this Camaro is an air suspension system which improves ride quality comfort and the overall appearance of the car. This car features an AM/FM radio and CD player so you can listen to your favorite tunes as you drive around in your fine piece of American automotive history. The first-generation Camaro appeared in dealerships in 1966 for 1967 model year. A brand-new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform was created as a 2-door 2+2 hardtop or convertible with the choice of a straight 6 or a mighty V8 powerplant. Almost all 1967-1969 Camaros were built in the two U.S. assembly plants in Norwood Ohio and Van Nuys California. There were also five non-U.S. Camaro assembly plants in countries that required local assembly and content. These plants were located in the Philippines Belgium Switzerland Venezuela and Peru. In 1969 the Camaro carried over the previous year\"??s drivetrain and major mechanical components but all-new sheet metal except the hood and trunk lid gave the car a much sportier look. The grille featured a heavy \"??V\"?\u009d can\"??t and deeply inset headlights. The Camaro go new door skins rear quarter panels and rear valance panel which gave the car a much lower wider and more aggressive look. The 1969 model year was exceptionally long extending into November 1969 due to manufacturing problem that delayed the introduction of the second-generation model planned for 1970. It is a popular myth late-69 Camaros were sold as 1970 models (due to GM publicity pictures of the 69 Camaro labeled as a 1970) but they were all assigned 1969 VIN codes.

This Camaro has under 2000 miles since its rebuild and has plenty of life left in this powerful engine set-up.  The paint on this Camaro always looks wet and is absolutely eye catching.  This 69 Camaro is dressed in Bright Orange with trademark white Camaro hood stripes.  The interior is a very clean white vinyl interior which has recently been detailed.  This Camaro handles like it should thanks to its power steering brand-new transmission new clutch and recently built engine all with just 2000 miles since complete.
