After all, we all love Hugger Orange paint, RS hidden headlights, dual stripes, and houndstooth interiors.  And then when you add in plenty more goodies, including a powerful V8, then you realize this icon is irresistible.  ", "  There's just something about a Hugger Orange Camaro.  It's bold enough to warn others on the streets don't mess with me! and it just seems to be a beacon at car shows.  This one is particularly nice because the color has been applied recently with a very professional hand, so you get a great modern clearcoat shine.  But there's much more to this coupe's attractive presentation because it seems to strike a nice balance between premium and intimidation.  For example, the Z/28-style dual white stripes are a great aggressive touch, but when combined with the newer white vinyl roof, it gives the impression of a very thoughtful and highly optioned total package.   The Rally Sport hidden headlights, Super Scoop cowl hood, front air dam, and D80 ducktail spoiler all add more aggression.  But then you check out the shine on the freshly dipped bumpers and the iconic rally wheels.  Soon you realize that classic muscle prowess and premium appearance can come together on one vintage Chevy.  ", "  Open the door to another great icon.  The factory-correct houndstooth interior does a great job of continuing this coupe's premium image.  Plus, with such a pristinely white presentation on the side panels and seats, the interior and exterior accents match to unite a very well-coordinated total package.  Beautiful wood grained appliques on the center console match the lower dash and factory steering wheel. But these kinds of details are often missed because everyone's attention usually gravitates to the iconic horseshoe shifter. There are great factory features like seatbelts and provisions for air conditioning.  Plus, a few subtle upgrades like the auxiliary gauge trio and knob-style AM/FM stereo with digital tuner add some extra comfort without taking away from the vintage premium atmosphere.  ", "  Under the hood is plenty of style and substance.  You can tell from the shine on the 350 cubic-inch V8 that there has been a nice investment in upgrades.  This includes performance components such as a large Holley four-barrel carburetor, aluminum hi-rise intake, aluminum heads, and Mallory ignition.  You've got a great set of Doug's Headers that adds power as they increase the rumble of the stainless H-pipe dual exhaust.

The bold looks are now backed up by a 490+hp monster motor, and plenty of other performance goodies in this thoroughly upgraded coupe.  So if you're ready to own the streets, this is ready today.  ", "  You know you love the look of these later 2nd generation Camaros.  The angular design could have almost passed for European if it were not for the aggressive body classing.  And of course, painting it a classic color like Carousel Red instantly makes it an American classic.  But that's only the tip of the custom details.  The billet grille gives the front end a clean-n-mean look that's highlighted even further by the chrome headlight surrounds.  Then as you move further down the car, the hood pins and extra tall custom cowl hood let everyone know that there was some serious investment in performance.  Just in case they didn't pick up on that cue, the aggressive stance gives this coupe the profile of a boxer leaning in for the first punch.    ", "  Inside the black is the perfect complement to the exterior accent color seen on the grille, rear window slats, and taillight panel.  The dark finish is well preserved on the door panels, headliner, and carpeting.  You'll love how plush the high back bucket seats feel, and how they encapsulate you so well when combined with the armrest center console.  In fact, the positioning of the new three-spoke steering wheel (w/power steering), and tall shifter, have the kind of easy reach you'd expect from a modern sports machine.  You have a clear view at the larger speedo and tach, which is a very good thing, because you're going to be watching those constantly.  ", "  If all you did was open the hood at a car show or cruise-in, the crowds would gather just for all the right investments in beautifully polished components.  But even if you never showed off the engine bay, this would still be quite a popular Z.  That's because beyond the shine is performance-built 383 cubic-inch stroker motor. The long list of stout components in this build include an Eagle crank, Scat six-inch I-beam rods, Manley flat-top forged pistons (11:1 compression), vortec heads, Manley retainers with PSI springs, stainless valves, stainless roller rockers, roller cam, ported & powder coated intake, long tube headers, 850 CFM Demon four-barrel carburetor, and much more (call for all the details.) Just know that this has been dynoded at 492 horsepower, and the Cherry Bomb dual exhaust announces this power superiority with a thunderous roar.  And when you have a muscle machine like this, the only way to control it is with a Borg Warner Super T10 four-speed and strong Centerforce clutch.  This sends the power to a versatile 3.73 rear end with Positraction.  The suspension has been upgraded for all this power, including one-inch drop spindles, huge rear tractions bars, and four-wheel disc brakes with drilled and slotted rotors.  Finish it off with seriously wide rubber on iconic Cragar SS wheels, and you have a total power package that looks right and handles like a mean machine should.   ", "  Complete with plenty of build receipts, here's a classic Camaro that has an awesome appearance and all the right moves to live up to its bold first impression.

How about a genuine X11 car that has been upgraded to modern LS1 power, bold paint, and more modern technology than when it left the factory...that's what's truly superior.  ", "  There are zero worries that anyone will look at this coupe and think it's bone stock.  There were some yellows on the '69 Camaro color palette, but the luster you get off of the modern paint instantly let's everyone know this is more than just straight from the factory.  The investment in plenty of modern clearcoat even extends to the pained black dual stripes to give you a package that leaves an impression no matter if it's showcased in the sunlight, or moonlight.  And speaking of nighttime, if you choose, you're going to love cruising this coupe in the dark, because the multi-color LED lights under the car are a cool way to announce that this is a true restomod.  But even without the modern lights, this is an intimidating package.  You get the RS's blacked-out grille with hidden headlights, the power bulge of the cowl induction hood, and the full length D80 rear spoiler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all true hallmarks of the best first-gen Camaros.    ", "  Inside is very cool but subtle mixture of modern and original styles.  The best place to see this is on the front seats.  These buckets look like premium stock, but the condition is so nice you know there was some real investment in new covers.  Plus, the rear looks great with the custom yellow SS stitching.  You get the desirable factory center console that houses icons like the horseshoe shifter and quad auxiliary gauge package with some custom touches of carbon fiber.  Above that is an AM/FM/CD stereo.  And the treats for the driver don't end there.  You get a custom wood and aluminum sports steering wheel with a Chevy bow tie etched in the center.  Beyond that are the white-faced Dakota Digital gauges that provide a clear view of the large speedo and tach.  This kind of setup is perfectly paired for the highly desireable upgrade under the hood.  ", "  While you'll love showing off the interior and exterior, we bet it's the engine bay that you're going to be showcasing the most.  The yellow and black color scheme that's been everywhere on this car so far is repeated under the hood with dark black hoses and fender walls joined by the bright yellow firewall.  And of course, everyone will also instantly marvel at the custom engine covers and alternator that adds a cool wet look to the exterior yellow. But more than just appearance, you are looking at a modern fuel-injected powerplant.  The heart of this beast is an upgraded 5.7-liter LS1 V8.  Beyond just adding a naturally high performance motor, this one has been upgraded with go-fast goodies.  It inhales deeply from Spectre intake, and the V8 exhales with authority through headers connected to a stainless steel dual exhaust with performance X-pipe construction.  But besides just having a wicked growl, it can keep cool while running hard thanks to an aluminum radiator and electric fan.  Components like that hint at a very thoughtful total build.  So does the 4L60E four-speed automatic transmission that's stout enough to handle all the power, and also it provides overdrive cruising.  Plus, you get power steering, front disc brakes, and grippy Hankook low profile tires mounted on those iconic Torq Thrust wheels.  All this makes it the perfect classic for all occasions.  ", "  There was a lot of time, inspiration, and money invested into making this Camaro so lustworthy. It's all the iconic pieces you love about a first-generation coupe, backed up by a beastly fuel-injected heart.  If you're quick enough to get here first, this turnkey restomod is ready for the open road.

So if you love all the iconic touches, and also love to drive your classics, keep reading for the best of everything...  ", "  If it's attention you crave, this car delivers in spades. The black paint has all the right modern gloss and shine to highlight the added curves Chevy gave the F-body in '69. The ivory double sport stripe package is an icon for the Camaro, and it provides the perfect contrasting color to ensure this muscle machine is memorable day or night.  Of course what really makes this a desirable Chevy is the Rally Sport package with the headlights that are hidden behind the mean-looking blacked front out panel.  All the other goodies on the car make it easy to love, including the chin air dam, cowl induction hood, and ducktail spoiler that always finishes these cars with a flourish.  And with a Camaro that looks so authentically nice on the outside, only iconic Rally wheels will do.  ", "  The deluxe houndstooth interior is beautifully finished and shows off this particular Camaro's luxury/performance mission. The buckets feel fresh, and they look perfect with the pristine door panels and carpeting. Beautiful wood grained appliques on the center console match the lower dash. But these kinds of details are often missed because everyone's attention usually gravitates to the iconic horseshoe shifter. For the driver, this is a cool piece to rest your right hand, while the left one grabs the wheel.  This one has some nice upgrades like an AM/FM/cassette stereo and a trio of auxiliary gauges, but the most interesting feature came directly from the factory.  Not many cars had a rear defogger from Chevy, but this rare option is still functioning well today!  ", "  While this is a number-matching 327 cubic-inch small block V8, you can take one look at it and know something more sinister is going on under the hood.  The motor has been upgraded with performance in mind, including a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Offenhauser intake, and long tube headers.  That last one also contributes to a more muscular growl out of the newer stainless dual exhaust. The power is put to the road via a TH400 three-speed automatic transmission that hooks to a stout 12-bolt rear end.  It's all easy to keep under control thanks to power steering and the upgrade to four-wheel disc brakes.  This makes for a total package that is a great anytime cruiser.  ", "  This Camaro turns heads wherever it goes with its slick paint and ferocious growl.  And since it's such an easy driver, you get to show it off everywhere.  That's why we know it's a hot deal that will be leaving us soon.
