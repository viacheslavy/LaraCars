And the first Generation Mach 1 that was only built for two years did not disappoint, especially when it was equipped with the ''Holy Grail'' of options like this 428 Super Cobra Jet, R-Code, 4-speed ''Drag Pack'' car.  I will get right to the point on this car considering if you are unaware of what a Mach 1 is then this is not the car for you.  First off, this car was purchased by the consignor in 1971, where he immediately changed the color from red to Wimbledon White at the age of 18.  The seller has been working on cars long before then and still today.  He has amassed a very nice collection of cars and Fords are what he knows best.  The latest restoration kept the car white but the body, frame and everything else were done to Factory Specs.  The non-original engine was pulled and sent to Mikes Competition Engines where it had a full work up and then put on a dyno with scores coming out at 460 HP with 513 Foot pounds of Torque.  This car is a factory R-Code with original build sheet to prove it.  The car comes with the original oil cooler, oil pan, heads and intake manifold.  It has a 780 CFM race ready carb, the original close ratio 4-speed, shaker, 9'' housing and 31 Spline Axles.  It also has a Hurst competition plus linkage and Wilwood disc brakes for stopping power.  There is little else we have offered that runs, sounds and drives like this car.  It has some great history and is well worth the asking price.", "To see over 80 photos of this car, including under carriage please visit our website www.grautogallery.com", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.

The details: matching-numbers 428 Cobra Jet. Factory A/C. Meadowlark Yellow. 100% ready to rock.", "This gorgeous fastback has been restored to stock specs and that's a good thing when you're talking about Mach 1s. With prices spiking up each year, now is the time to grab one, and this is only the latest in a long line of quality Mach 1s we've seen come and go through our showroom. Code W5 Meadowlark Yellow was rather rare back in 1969 but that rarity makes this car really stand out today. With the restoration on this one being a few years old, you won't be afraid to drive your investment, but it's still nice enough to show up at a regional Mustang Club event and be competitive; it's that nice! Authentic Mach 1 details include the blacked-out hood with scoop, front and rear spoilers, and rear window slats, not to mention the black and yellow graphics along the sides and surrounding the taillights. The chrome, stainless, and Mach 1-specific badges are all in good shape, too. And the combination of the soft color and massive performance is just too cool.", "The interior is correctly restored, too, featuring black Comfort-Weave buckets with red stripes, just as when it was new. It shows a few signs of use, but overall it's quite impressive with no rips or tears, correct red floor mats, and a center console. Ford's mission for the Mach 1 was to be both luxurious and sporty, so options like factory A/C (system works but could use a top-off on the refrigerant) and lots of woodgrained appliques give it a more mature look and feel. The gauges are probably original, but they look great in the deeply-set round pods that house each one, and the 72,890 miles shown are authentic. The AM radio and automatic transmission make this car easy to live with, and perhaps more closely matches the luxury/performance mission Ford envisioned for the Mach 1. Fold-down rear seats also make the Mach 1 sportsroof surprisingly practical, and the trunk is nicely finished with a correct mat and spare tire with cover.", "For your Mach 1, if you wanted the ultimate in performance, you checked the box marked '428 Cobra Jet.' This is the car's original, numbers-matching engine, and it's grossly under-rated at 335 horsepower. It's also surprisingly smooth and torquey, again befitting the Mach 1's split personality. The engine bay is nicely detailed, a result of a high-quality restoration in 2001, and it hasn't been driven much since then. The carburetor is an aftermarket Holley 4-barrel, there's an MSD ignition system, and an aluminum radiator up front, but beyond that, it's quite stock, from the air cleaner showing original decals to stock exhaust manifolds feeding a rumbling Flowmaster dual exhaust system. A C6 3-speed automatic is heavy-duty enough to handle the horsepower and feeds a 9-inch rear full of 3.91 gears, so this is a brutally fast weapon around town, even today. Power disc brakes and power steering are critical to a big block Mustang like this, and the undercarriage shows signs of detailing even though the restoration is older. Modern 17-inch aluminum wheels are replicas of the original Magnum 500s and wear 235/45/17 front and 255/45/17 rear Nitto performance radials.", "Buy this car now or regret it later.

But when it has been given a nut-and-bolt restoration to make sure that the rest of the coupe is just as genuine and original as its numbers-matching 428 Cobra Jet V8, well then, you can instantly understand the difference between showing up to the car show and winning it all. And yes, the 24,000-mile odometer is actual!", "One look at the Marti Report, and it will show you everything you want to see.  This sportsroof Mustang is a 63 code Mach 1 in T code Candyapple Red paint with a blacked out hood and that bold Cobra Jet shaker. Proper gold Mach 1 stripes on the side and rear add a touch of upper-class sportiness.  And speaking of class, the condition of all the brightwork from the bumpers to the stylized steel wheels is just downright smooth.  But above all, the reason why people will stop and stare at this coupe is because of its level of quality.  This is one of those fantastic lost cars that spent three decades in storage before going though the kind of restoration you see at Pebble Beach.  Today that means an ultra-low mileage coupe that gets all the details right.  It has the kind of panel alignment that will make people wonder if even it looked this good when it left the San Jose factory over 45 years ago.", "You'll enjoy reviewing the copy of the original window sticker because it will show you the long list of options still in this interior. It starts with the comfortable high back bucket seats with a sporty red line running across the neckline.  As you step inside, you'll notice the exceptional condition of the carpets, door panels, and headliner. The wood appearance on the Rim-Blow deluxe steering wheel coordinates with the paneling on the dash, doors, and center console, all of which all adds to the upscale ambiance of the Mach 1.  Pay special attention to the level of quality on the materials used in this restoration.  You might have sat in Mustangs before, but this one feels like a time machine back to the summer of '69.", "This is an R-code Mustang, which means the big block 428 cubic-inch V8 with ram air is under the hood.  It's not just that motor looks fantastically authentic down to the correct stamping and chalk makes, but also this is ultra-desirable because you're looking at the original numbers-matching powerplant.  You already know the engine bay could win awards on its own just by its presentation, but really take some time to look over the details in the undercarriage photos.  Every aspect is crisp and correct right down to the correct red oxide protection paint (yup, you'll be carrying around a mirror to put under this one.) But more than just for showing off, a Cobra Jet Mustang is built to for those who love to drive.  Engines from this era were famously underrated, so the impressive 335 hp advertised by the factory was really pushing a mind-blowing 400+ hp. It's mated to a stout Ford C6 three-speed automatic transmission, and it is sent to the road via Ford's nine-inch rear end running a versatile 3.50 ratio.  The combination of the Mach 1 package and the big engine further sweetened the deal by automatically getting upgraded to Ford's HD competition suspension.  This beefed up the front spindles, shocks, shock towers, and anti-roll bar to make sure that this Mustang could handle the extra muscle. Ford even upgraded the package with the sport exhaust with quad tips (everything can be verified in the detailed Marti report included with the car.)  The cherry on top is that all this power can be kept in check thanks to the optional front disc brakes.", "Complete with all the right paperwork, including the owner's manual, title docs, Elite Marti Report, and window sticker, this is the ultimate collector edition of the ultimate vintage Mustang.  A low-mileage, numbers-matching 428 Mach 1 is just as rare and exceptional as you think it is, so don't miss your opportunity.

In the sixteen years since the movie debuted, no other Mustang is as recognizable as \u201cEleanor\u201d and no movie car has been imitated more. Built by Cinema Vehicle Services in Hollywood, California, a total of eleven 1967 and 1968 Ford Mustang Fastbacks were built for the film, and although some were wrecked, a number survived filming and have since been sold. This 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback is Eleanor 4 built for the film, and has just completed a 0-mile, ground up restoration at Cinema Vehicle Services, the people who know her best. Each Eleanor was built to perform a different function in the movie and so received slightly different builds, although aesthetically they were built to look identical. This Eleanor is powered by a stroked 347ci small block Ford built by Blueprint Engines and features aluminum heads, roller cam, Edelbrock Performer intake manifold, Holley Ultra Double Pumper carburetor, MSD Pro billet distributor, MSD Blaster coil, MSD Street Fire CDI ignition, ceramic coated headers, March serpentine accessory drive system, Canton 6-quart deep sump oil pan and pickup, and a Nitrous Oxide Systems Powershot nitrous system. Backed up by a Tremec 5-speed manual transmission, the drivetrain has also been built up using a Ram flywheel and clutch, QuickTime bellhousing, Wenco custom-built driveshaft, and a hydraulic clutch system by Modern Driveline. Out back, the rear end was built by Ron's Rear Ends in Los Angeles, California, and features a Currie rear differential housing and axles, Energy Suspension bushings, and a Posi rear diff with 3.70 gears. To keep everything under control, the Mustang features front and rear power disc brakes with a Wilwood master cylinder with Wilwood calipers, oversized cross-drilled rotors, and front lightweight hubs, while the front end features a Total Control Products power rack and pinion steering system with Total Control front suspension and coil over shocks along with a Monte Carlo brace, tower export brace, and truss brace. Throughout the car, custom stainless brake and fuel lines have been fabricated along with a custom stainless exhaust with dual Magnaflow mufflers. Inside the cabin, the interior remains mostly stock, with the exception of Total Control Products clutch and brake pedals, an Autometer Sport-Comp Monster tachometer with shift light, and a Hurst shifter with the infamous \u201cGo Baby Go\u201d shift knob along with the nitrous system arming switch while the trunk houses the nitrous bottle along with a Fuel Safe fuel cell with bladder for safety. Now, although the build itself is pretty impressive, the most alluring feature of this Mustang is that it is an authentic Eleanor. Sure, clones can be built or bought, but there are clones and then there is the real deal and this car is the real deal, nothing else comes close. Sitting behind the wheel of a car that created an entirely new genre of car builds when it was designed, this car is a piece of movie and automobile history.

A wide-ratio Tremec 6-speed manual transmission and 4-link located Moser 3.50:1 Positraction differential with 31-spline axles complete the heavy-duty drivetrain. TCI front and rear suspension with Ridetech adjustable coilovers, rack-and-pinion steering and Wilwood 4-wheel disc brakes with drilled-and-slotted rotors and powder-coated calipers team up for road-hugging handling delivered by low-profile rubber on chrome U.S. Mag wheels.
