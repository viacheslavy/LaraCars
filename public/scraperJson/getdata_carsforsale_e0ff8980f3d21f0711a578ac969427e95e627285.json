Even though this car was originally Lime gold metallic and painted Blue some time ago it is one of the cleanest body's I have ever seen! All original metal and fiberglass. NO rust or signs of collision what so ever. From what I have been told and looked at on the car it has had the front/ rear suspension rebuilt. As well as the complete brake system. More recently the oil was changed, tune up, carb's rebuilt, gas tank, windshield, front seat upholstery, starter, heater core and more were replaced. The motor starts right up no smoke, leaks or noises. I have road tested this car like all the ones I put up for sale and it funs out great.   The clutch and all forward/ reverse gears engage smoothly. This car is totally road worthy, a good  driver. The head lights, wipers and turn signals all work with the exception of the turn signals, they work  slow.
