The Shriner organization is made up of people who raise money for hospitals that allow very sick children to receive free medical care.  These \u201cShriners\u201d often participate in local parades with identical specialty cars.  This Corvette was used for that purpose.  After nearly 10 years of ownership, with the special Shriner emblem still on the rear bumper, this owner decided to sell this Corvette.  It had just over 40,000 miles on it by this time.  He had taken excellent care of the car, but had replaced the original Rally Sport Wheels with Turbo Mag wheels.

For affordable horsepower, it's pretty darned tough to beat a C3 like this.", "All the usual faults that these cars have after almost forty years were corrected when this one was repainted a few years ago. Nice-looking bumpers front and rear make for a seamless transition to the bodywork, free of the usual cracks and waves you find in the original pieces and the paint actually matches, which you can't always say for the originals. The headlight mechanisms sit flush with the bodywork like they should, and all the original fiberglass was sanded and smoothed in preparation for the fresh electric blue paint. It's modern urethane, so the finish looks deep and lustrous, and the color is exactly right, glowing in the sunlight. Fit and finish are good, particularly for a Corvette of this vintage and there really is nothing like a brightly colored Corvette to attract a crowd. Of interest, there's a correct L-48 emblem on the hood, twin chrome mirrors, and a strip of stainless along the rockers to make it look long and low. And if you like the open-air feel, pulling the T-tops is a no-hassles job and the tops stow easily behind the seats.", "Tan leather is a wonderful complement to the blue paint, elegant and sporty at the same time. Most all the soft parts were replaced during the renovation, including new seat covers over factory frames, fresh door panels, and handsome dark tan carpets that add some much-appreciated contrast. It also appears that the dash and console were freshened to give everything a uniformly finished look, and the gauges themselves are in excellent condition. There's a newer AM/FM/CD stereo with remote in the center stack, right below the original gauges. Options include cold A/C, a tilt/telescope steering column, and power windows, all of which make this Corvette a great no-compromises cruiser. The cargo area was freshened with new carpets as well and there are new Corvette-logo floor mats to protect the floor.", "The engine is the original L48 350 cubic inch V8, which appears to have been freshened a bit to help built some extra horsepower. An Edelbrock intake manifold and a 4-barrel carburetor help the L48 breathe a little better and the ignition system has likewise been upgraded with an Accel coil, but it isn't radical or fussy so you're always able to jump in and hit the road. Bright Chevy Orange paint looks great in the satin black engine bay, along with chrome valve covers and a big open-element air cleaner to really let it breathe. There's also a new alternator, a fresh master cylinder for the power brakes, and a mellow dual exhaust system to give it a great sound that never gets annoying. The original TH350 3-speed automatic still hands out the torque and original style Rally wheels carry chrome spinners and 225/60/15 Firestone radials.", "This is a fun, handsome Corvette at an appealing price, ready to enjoy.
