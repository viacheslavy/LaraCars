This here is a 1973 Datsun 240Z.  This was marketed in its home land of Japan as the Fairlady Z.  This was a very popular vehicle when it hit our shores and remains extremely popular today with the 370Z's.  The fit and finish on this car are in great shape and factory fresh.  This fair lady has had one repaint about 5 years ago and the white paint presents very well today.  All of the doors, hatch back and hood close just like they should which means that all of the hinges are good and don't sag.  This car looks just like one that you would have found on a lot back in the day.  It is just that clean.    Now we know that you can not resist just wanting to jump in this car.  So, open up that driver door and slide yourself in to this surprisingly roomy interior.  There is ample leg room in this car.  Some of us here are over 6 feet tall and we fit very well in it.  Everything is easy to reach and easy to read in this almost cockpit like interior.  There is a little patina in the drivers seat, but no major rips or tears, and the passenger seat looks like it has never been sat in.  There are also no rips or tears in the dash or headliner, and as you will see in the pics, the rear cargo area is in great shape as well with plenty of storage room, and even extra speakers to give you all the sound you need to cruise down the road.    Ok, enough about how comfortable this car is.  This is a drivers car.  With the coil spring front suspension and independent rear suspension, this fair lady is just begging you to throw her in to some turns and go have some fun.  So reach out for that key and turn her over to listen to that 2.4 liter engine just purr like a kitten.  This car was not built for a ton of horse power, it was built for driving excitement, and that is what this car delivers.  150 HP for a car that only weights 2300 pounds is just begging you to go find some curvy roads to go have some fun with.  So lean on the gas, and ease off the clutch, and leave wherever you are in the dust, and get ready to go have the drive of your life.  Once you bang through the gears of this baby you will see why we say that this baby is just so much fun to drive.    We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms and allow you to pay your baby off when you want to without any prepayment penalties.  This way you don't have to take all of the cash out of the bank at once and still get the car of your dreams.  We look forward to speaking with you soon, and making you the newest member of the Just Toys Classic Cars family.

With great handling and a balanced chassis, this 1982 Datsun 280ZX 2+2 provides a low-cost way into a pretty capable sports car that can still put a big grin on the driver's face.  ", "  By looking at this car, you'd never really know that it has already passed its 30th birthday. Thanks to the bright silver color, which we believe is its original paint, it still looks sleek and contemporary and not nearly as dated as some of the other cars built in the early '80s. Typical of Japanese manufacturers of the period, build quality is quite good with sharp gaps and pieces that fit properly, and the paint job is holding up rather well, suggesting great care since it was new. Without stripes or add-ons like a rear wing, the car retains the clean look of the original Z-car, which itself was often compared to the E-Type Jaguar; heady company indeed. The bumpers are well-integrated into the overall design and black body side moldings add some contrast as well as being practical. The black anodized trim and rubber pieces strongly suggest a car that has always been well-maintained and kept out of the elements, and even the taillights are still bright and clear.   ", "  The gray cloth interior shows a few hints of 1980s sensibility, but the bucket seats remain supremely comfortable for long hauls and supportive for aggressive maneuvers. No rips or tears in the seating surfaces are another sign of careful ownership and the original carpets remain in good shape thanks to the protection of matching embroidered floor mats. Instrumentation is traditional Z, with a big speedometer and tach for the driver and auxiliary gauges in the center of the dash, a look that still shows up in today's 370Z. Just about everything was standard on the 280ZX, including A/C, power windows, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo that was still pretty cutting-edge in 1982. The 2+2 models offered a modest rear seat that's good for kids or adults on short trips, and there's a good amount of storage space under the rear hatch, which also offers a full set of gray carpets that are in remarkable condition.  ", "  The 2.8 liter inline-six provides silky smooth torque and a rorty sound that is definitely reminiscent of great sports cars from Europe. Thanks to fuel injection, it starts easily and pulls smoothly without getting fussy, and despite the complex-looking engine bay, these cars are rather easy to work on and parts are still plentiful. There are no obvious modifications and it drives like a stocker, so someone has definitely taken care of it along the way and the clean look speaks highly of the dedicated maintenance it has enjoyed. A 3-speed automatic transmission makes it easy for anyone to drive and doesn't dilute the experience one bit, as the suspension still grabs in corners and has a playful, tossable nature that only rear-wheel-drive sports c"], "title": "1982 Datsun 280ZX GL 2+2 ", "total_results": "72", "price": "9995", "kilometers": 177461.437, "total_pages": 4, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/14731141", "brand": "Datsun", "reference_id": "14731141", "year": "1982", "model": "280ZX", "specs": {"Engine": "2.8L I6", "Mileage": "110,293 miles", "Exterior Color": "Silver", "Transmission": "Automatic 3-Speed", "Interior Color": "Gray", "Drive Train": "RWD", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

A beautiful little sports car, that outperformed the likes of the Porsche 911 and Jaguar E-Type of the era, for about half of the price.  Needless to say, the Z clobbered competition from the likes of Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Opel, Triumph and MG.  Now, as you've watched the prices climb on all those brands just mentioned, it's looking like the Japanese classics are now going to follow suit and climb in value as well.      This 1972 240Z has been repainted in a nice shade of Lime Green.  The original color looks to have been Code 112, Yellow.  The seats have also been recovered in a new, black vinyl.  The original engine has been upgraded to an L28, from a 280Z.  Giving the car almost 20 more horsepower and torque than the original engine would have.  The inline 6 in this car runs nice and strong and has a sporty note from the exhaust.  The 5 speed manual allows the driver to stir through the gears while the independent suspension front and back take care of the handling.  This Datsun also has air conditioning.

It features a 2.8L inline six-cylinder engine under the hood with a 5-speed manual transmission, and this one is impressively equipped with cold A/C, power front disc brakes, power steering/windows/mirrors/locks, cruise control, nice alloy wheels and an upgraded sound system.  This beauty is a superior driver as well and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available at a steal of a price for one lucky collector. ", "The 1982 Datsun 280 ZX was the first year of production for this second generation model and the first time it wore the Nissan badging along with the familiar Datsun brand name in the United States.  Also known as the Nissan Fairlady Z overseas, this model was produced for only two years before the 300 ZX came to market in 1986.  Collectors actively seek these models because of their great curb appeal and ultra-sporty handling, and this particular example is a one-family owned lifetime vehicle with extensive documentation.", "In terms of condition, this 1982 Datsun 280 ZX appears to be completely original from bumper to bumper and with some visible fading of original paint and only minor wear and tear to interior.  The factory paint still shines admirably, however, and the interior is super clean throughout.  It performs nicely out on the open road as well so this one really doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need anything to be enjoyed immediately. ", "Overall, this rare 1982 Datsun 280 ZX is a true survivor that would make a perfect daily driver for a college student or any performance enthusiast.  It is simply a great entry-level classic.
