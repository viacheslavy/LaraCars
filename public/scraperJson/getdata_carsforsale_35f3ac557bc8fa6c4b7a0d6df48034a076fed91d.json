Has a little bit of bondo in small areas but no large areas  Underneath there is some rust which is quite common in these cars and the floor pans would eventually need replaced   Classic cars like these don't have titles just a transferable registration."], "title": "1966 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "17", "price": "8995", "kilometers": "", "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/20767753", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "20767753", "year": "1966", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "", "Mileage": "", "Exterior Color": "", "Transmission": "", "Interior Color": "", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}}
