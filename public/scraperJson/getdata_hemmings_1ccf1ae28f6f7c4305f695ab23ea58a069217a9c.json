It's a rare color offered for only a couple of years, and its name alone instantly reminds you of the Corvette's victories on the racetrack.  It brightly highlights the crisp lines of the shark-like nose, rounded fenders, and integrated rear spoiler.  And this one has two terrific attitudes you can choose from.  The black convertible top coordinates with the custom black side vents for a hint of two-tone flair, or you can use the color-matched hardtop to maximize the bold yellow.  No matter which way you motor, you're going to enjoy plenty of bright work. On a properly presented '70 that means nicely finished intricate chrome bumpers, bright rocker panels, and iconic Rally wheels.", "Inside there have been a ton of great investments.  It starts with an upgrade to later-style C3 bucket seats.  These tan leather units not only have better bolstering, but they also offer better access to the rear storage.  Plus, custom matching door panels, center console, and dash mean you'll be proud to show off this convertible's interior.  The custom sports steering wheel also has coordinating tan inserts, and it gives you even better grip.  Beyond that is a large speedo and tach, and you have a full array of auxiliary readouts just to the side.  But more than just a driver's machine, this one is comfortable, too.  Power windows, a tilt steering column, and the stereo has been upgraded to an AM/FM/CD unit that has a fold-out screen for GPS navigation.  Because the air conditioning is now blowing cold with modern R134a, you can enjoy the drop top experience well into the summer season.", "Under the hood is a fresh GM 350 cubic-inch crate motor.  The V8 only has about 2,000 miles on it, and you can tell it's new by the shine of all the polished elements like the intake, air topper, master cylinder, alternator, compressor, and so much more.  Beyond the style, you'll find substance you'll really enjoy.  The V8 inhales deeply through a four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority as headers contribute to the rumble of the Flowmaster dual exhaust.  Plus, there is an aluminum radiator w/electric fan so this classic 'Vette can stay cool even if you're in traffic with the A/C pumping.  But really we know you're going to be enjoying this one on the open road.

So look over all the details of this classic to see how it's the perfect mix of investment and originality.", "This one really seems to get its total appearance right, and it all starts with the paint. This is a later application that properly applied a bright white with plenty of luster.  Because both the folding soft top and removable hardtop are in an equally pristine white, this has a terrific total coordination no matter how you drive it.  Also the clear coat shine of the paint loves to highlight all the iconic pieces of this Stingray.  After all, the design perfectly bends the rounded fenders with sharp elements like the well-creased door line and shark-like nose.  Plus, the panels have the fit of good care an investment right down to the smooth headlight flaps and the doors you can shut with authority.  These earlier C3s are also for the bright work lovers, and so the thin bumpers, bright grilles, rocker panels, and Rally wheels come together to add to this vintage shine package.", "While either one of the white tops give this 'Vette a sophisticated appearance, neither one of them can beat the look with the roof off.  That's because the factory-correct blue give this one a European-like sensibility.  The bright tones on the door panels, carpeting, dash, and newly covered bucket seats are like looking into an ocean.  This classic really does a have a period-correct feel, right down to the heat/defrost sliders and factory AM/FM stereo.  But more than just appearance, this one was meant to be driven.  That's why you have the three-spoke sports steering wheel that gives you a terrific view of the large speedo and tach.  Just to the side is a full auxiliary gauge panel that's mounted high so you never have to let your eyes stray too far.", "When you lift the hood, you can see this car is the total package. This is the original, matching-numbers 350 cubic inch V8.  With all the components in top condition and the belts & hoses looking so tidy, there's nothing to get in the way of seeing the shine on the air cleaner, distributor shield, and other polished pieces.  While the appearance is great, you also have the confidence that this original motor is fresh from a recent tune-up.  The total control that four-speed manual transmission gives you over the V8 and its rumbling soundtrack is another reminder of how much a driver's classic this really is.  Plus, the power steering, four-wheel disc brakes, and fully independent suspension keeps this one of the best vintage sports cars around.", "Complete with owner's manual, this Stingray provides distinction and history in a terrific droptop package.

This car is absolutely amazing.", "The interior of this sweet ride is in awesome shape as well.  There are no rips or tears in the seats or dash and the tan top is brand new.  This car is a time capsule.  It has the original radio in it and the clock works as well and everything is easily reachable and pleasing to the eye.  This has always been one of the great things about this sports car through its history.  You slide yourself in to the seat and you instantly just feel good and want to see how fast you can go.", "Now, this is 1973 so by this time, horsepower was not at a premium, but you were driving a light weight Corvette.  It sounded awesome and when you put the top down, even better.  The original numbers matching 350 on this sweet ride only put out a little over 200 HP, but it has plenty of get up and go in it.  The miles you see on the odometer are original.  Everything has been very well maintained.  All of this is mated to the original transmission and rear end.  We can not say enough how well this car has been maintined.  The only option that it doesn't have is the tilt/telescopic wheel.  It has power steering, power brakes, and cold a/c.  This would have been an expensive vette back in the day and the values are still going up today.  So hit that key and listen to that new exhaust fire up in your ear and work on trying to get rid of that ear to ear grin on your face.", "So put the top down on this baby, slap it in to drive, and get ready to have the drive of your life.  This car hits all of the right senses, it looks great, sounds awesome, and the smell of the wind in your hair with the top down is just te icing on the cake.  Make this bad boy yours today.  We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms with as little as 10% down and no prepayment penalties.  This way you can get the car of your dreams and don't have to pull all the cash out at once.
