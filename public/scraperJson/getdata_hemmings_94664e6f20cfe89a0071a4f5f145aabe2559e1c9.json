Zero rust.  83k original miles.  Original Paint.  New fuel system and tank.  Brand new air suspension.  There weren't a lot of these produced and to find one in this condition is very rare.", "History:  Originally bought in 1968 in San Francisco by Dr. Clifton Wright of Lake Tahoe, CA.  Sold to Roger Schaefer of San Luis Obispo in 1984.  Roger moved to Coeur D Alene, ID in 1988 and parked the car in storage in 1989.  It was in need of new air bellows as they were no longer holding air overnight.  Long story short, Roger was getting old and knew he wasn't going to be able to work on the car like he hoped so he drained the gas and fogged the cylinders.  I met Roger in 2014 and he gave me a sales pitch that made me buy the car from him impulsively.  I am the 3rd owner to this day.  I told him I would get it running and in proper order and we'll cruise it around.  I did get it running and the air suspension dialed in, but Roger is no longer mobile.", "Work Done: I disassembled the fuel system, cleaned it out, and had the tank relined.  Put in a new battery and it started up like it was just turned off yesterday.  25 years!!  The air suspension was fixed with all 4 new bellows as well as air control valves.  The longest I have let it sit without starting it is 3 weeks and it holds the air the entire time.  I decided to keep replacing parts so most of the belts and hoses are new.  This car should run worry free for a long time.", "Interior: The interior has been completely redone in original Mercedes leather to exactly match the original.  The original was green and wasn't in bad shape but definitely showed a little wear.  I originally intended to keep this car so I had the interior done in a saddle tan color  Again, it is EXACTLY the same as the original, but in a better (to me) color.  The carpet and floor mats were reproduced as well.", "Exterior: The paint is original and in pretty good shape.  The top shows a little sign of oxidation.  Not sure if it would buff out.  I have only washed it a few times as it has mostly sat in the garage minus a few trips to the office.  The hood and trunk show no signs of oxidation.  There is ZERO rust.  The window seals are a little dry.  If I were going to keep the car, I would most likely replace them for proper aesthetics.  They are available from the Classic center.  Not 100%, but I think I was quoted about $200 for all glass seals.  There are a few small dimples in the chrome bumpers that can easily be fixed.  The passenger door has a small dent.  Roger told me the car was bumped in a parking lot.  I haven't addressed anything on the exterior.", "Parts: I have the original manuals and the Becker Grand Prix radio.  I also lots of spare gaskets and hoses that Roger had bought when he parked the car in 1989.  As I said, he had intended to redo everything whether it needed it or not so he bought every possible spare part he though he might need.  I have used a lot of them but I will include what's left in the sale.", "Overall:  I'd say the car is an 8/10.  The interior is probably the nicest on any 300SE on the planet.  It runs like new.  The air suspension, which is the most costly to update is done.  If want an absolutely flawless show car, it would just need a small amount of attention on the exterior."], "Exterior:": "Olive", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "83658"}},
