You'd be hard-pressed to find a duplicate to this A-code pony with a strong-running 289 4V engine and a 4-speed for the asking price. Bright silver paint, a beautiful interior, and a lot of charisma make this a fantastic way to get into the Mustang hobby without a major investment.", "Repainted in what appears to be code 4 Silver Frost, this handsome coupe shows very well. Originally hailing from down south where it's spent most of its life, the familiar Mustang sheetmetal is crisp and sharp thanks to expert restoration work. They built a lot of Mustangs, most of them coupes just like this, but that doesn't mean they're not handsome, timeless cars, and except for perhaps a Corvette or a Porsche 911, there aren't many cars that are more recognizable around the world. This one has been nicely finished in a way that keeps it subtle but elegant, which means no stripes, scoops, or spoilers! It's not perfect, but very respectable and ready for the your local car show. With bright rocker panel moldings, and shiny chrome on the bumpers, and a custom grille, it's nicely detailed in the way you'd want your Mustang to look. It's not a fake GT, not dressed up like some Shelby wanna-be, just a clean coupe that totally nails the factory look. The result is straight and appropriate, making this a car you'll be proud to show at any level because it fits together so well.", "A handsome red bucket seat interior is a very desirable complement to the silver paint, and it's authentically restored with great detailing and attention to the little things. Look how neatly the seat covers fit, with just the right amount of padding underneath to create a supportive seat that doesn't look over-stuffed. Crisply marked gauges are all fully functional, another detail that you just don't see in cars priced like this, and an upgraded AM/FM/iPod stereo lives in the dash, which is a nice upgrade if you're going to drive the car regularly. There's a 4-speed shifter sticking out of the transmission tunnel, so you know this neat coupe means business. Add in a color-matched steering wheel, correct door panels, and a taut headliner, and it's hard to see how anyone could come out right-side-up financially with a sticker price like this. Interiors this nice are EXPENSIVE. And speaking of expensive, check out the stereo system living in the trunk!", "And this isn't just some 6-cylinder beater, either. For that price, you're getting a legitimate A-code 289 cubic inch V8, nicely detailed and running great. Someone took the time to do it right, as there's Ford Blue paint on the engine itself, a high-performance air cleaner assembly, MSD ignition and a set of finned valve covers that look great. There's a Holley double-pumper carburetor on top of an aluminum intake manifold for a few extra horsepower, and it spins to life easily with a nice bark from the dual exhaust system. The 4-speed clicks through the gears with authority, and highway-friendly gears out back make it an excellent highway cruiser. Underneath it's very clean and solid, with correct red oxide primer on the floors, just the way the factory did it. Styled steel wheels look awesome, especially wrapped in those sporting Goodyear white-letter radials.", "This car gets almost everything right: look, sound, and feel. If you want one of the last truly affordable early Mustangs that don't need a full a restoration, this Mustang is a shocking bargain.

It's a real C-code 289 V8 car, it's got the right colors, and it's available for about the price of a garden-variety daily driver. Wouldn't you rather have the Mustang?", "Go to a show today and you might be convinced that the roads were teeming with Shelbys and Mach 1s, but the truth is, this coupe is far more accessible and looks much more like what people were driving in 1967. The handsome Springtime Yellow paint is certainly eye-catching, and there aren't many folks alive today who don't crack a smile when they see an early Mustang like this. Obviously kept in a warm, dry climate, this super-straight old pony wears that burgundy paint in a subtle way, so it makes a statement without the need for spoilers, which always seem to get in the way of the Mustang's clean, honest look. Good panel alignment certainly helps and 1967's quarter panel inserts are far more interesting than the early cars' plain ones. The black stripe along the rockers is recent and it works rather well with the black vinyl top, which is likewise in great shape. We like the look because it combines an elegant, upscale image with just enough street fighter to make everyone respect it on the road.", "Mustangs were always equipped with wonderful, stylish, highly functional interiors, and this coupe is no exception. Bucket seats were standard (yes, you could get a bench in a Mustang, but why?) but these are aftermarket units that are far more supportive and aggressively bolstered than the originals. There's a big three-spoke steering wheel that works well in the Mustang's updated driver's compartment and it gives you great road feel. Round gauges covering the basics fill the dash and are probably original, the factory A/C still blows cold, and the shifter has a wooden handle that helps with the upscale vibe. The door panels, carpets, and headliner are all in good shape, and for entertainment it features a Sony AM/FM/CD stereo head unit. The trunk is neatly finished with a correct plaid mat as well as a spare tire with its own matching cover.", "Yes, this is a real c-code 289/2-barrel car and it sticks to the original recipe for reliability and ease of maintenance. It's detailed with bright Ford Blue engine enamel and simple stamped valve covers but a chrome air cleaner gives it a bit of a racy look. The A/C compressor dominates the engine bay, but underneath it, you'll spot factory power steering that makes this pony a car you could drive every day. The C4 3-speed automatic transmission offers crisp shifting and someone has just added a brand new dual exhaust system in place of the original single exhaust, and the soundtrack is much better now. The front suspension is stock, but that's OK because it works well, and the floors are in good order. Period Cragar mags are a great addition, looking sporty without being too modern, and they're fitted with a recent set of blackwall radials.", "Easy to live with, fun to drive, and affordable to buy, that's how the Mustang has always been great.

This 1965 Mustang coupe is just the right kind of car to get started in the hobby and no collection is complete without one of Ford's pony cars. It's not perfect, it's not a horsepower monster, but it is a clean, dependable, fun way to have fun in an old car without breaking the bank. No other car can deliver the experience of an early Mustang for so little cash.", "You can hardly go wrong with a classic Wimbledon White Mustang, which means you're going to get a lot of attention. It was never intended to be a show car (coupes just don't command the prices to justify a $10,000 paint job), but it presents rather well and you won't worry about driving it just about anywhere. Rain? No problem. Bugs? Forget about it. Parking lot? No worries. It's got a clean, honest look that works best on coupes and it's been spared the stripes and wings that plague so many other ponies. You'll note that it fits together pretty well, with good gaps and reasonable seams all around, so it has probably never been wrecked or rusty and seems to have led a pretty good life. A few chrome pieces make the Mustang look dressy, including the 1965-only grille with the cross-hairs, the quarter panel insert, and, of course, a shiny gas cap in the center of the rear panel. This is how Mustangs have looked for decades.", "The black bucket seat interior is how this car was originally delivered and it's in very good shape overall. It's probably a combination of original and replacement parts, because some things are just too nice to be 50 years old, including the carpets and the seat covers. There's a deep-dish steering wheel and the standard instruments keep an eye on the basics. The dash pad, headliner, and other soft parts don't need any attention at all, and with an AM/FM/cassette radio powering speakers on the rear package shelf, it's ready to go. The shifter for the 3-speed manual transmission falls easily to hand and looks great between the seats and the back seat is in great shape, too. A neatly finished trunk with a full-sized spare tire makes this car feel complete and ready for a road trip.", "Experts will note that the VIN contains a ''T'' which means a smooth-running 200 cubic inch inline-six, which is hardly a handicap. It's got a legendary reputation for durability and smoothness, and if you look around, you'll find a lot of guys who are very passionate about this engine. It looks quite stock with bright orange paint on the air cleaner and valve cover and black everywhere else, which is how they were delivered in 1965. The transmission shifts crisply and smoothly and with relatively relaxed gears out back, it's a wonderfully efficient car on the highway. The exhaust gives the six a great sound that's a little different than all the V8 cars but never annoying. The important parts are quite solid and blackwall radials on vintage ''kidney bean'' aluminum wheels give it a '60s performance look.", "For entry-level fun, it's hard to beat a Mustang coupe. Everyone loves these cars and few will realize just how affordable they are. A great opportunity for the first-time classic car buyer.
