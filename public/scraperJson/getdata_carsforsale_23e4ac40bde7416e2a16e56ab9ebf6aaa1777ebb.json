So when an iconic classic can be powerful, thoughtful, and affordable, you know it has serious appeal.  ", "  The color you see here is a fine representation of 1968's Meadowlark Yellow.  It's a great way to stand out while still following the heritage of the Mustang.  But the real reason why it works so well here is that it provides a bright and sunny disposition to an aggressively packaged pony car.  After all, the yellow is the perfect color for the contrasting blacked-out grille and blacked-out inserts in the deluxe hood. Plus, the those 15-inch Eagle Alloys draw extra attention to the intimidating forward-leaning stance.  So the yellow is like a friendly face luring you into a dark corner.  ", "  Inside there are more great upgrades.  The factory-correct black interior continues to look nice, and so it was easy to integrate some modern components.  After all, no one could get bucket seats with that kind of bolstering in '68.  These new additions can hug your body in the corners and provide all-day comfort.   Plus, the cup holder center console and grippy sports steering wheel on the tilt column come together to create an environment that envelops the driver.  It's an impressive upgraded performance package.  So while you have provisions for R134a air conditioning and an upgraded stereo, you're real focus will be on the white-faced gauges.  ", "  Ford's 289 cubic-inch V8 is one of those great power plants that's exceptionally reliable, and it's always ready for a few upgrades.  We're happy to see an investment in components like an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock Performer intake, and Mustang fined valve covers.  This V8 has been maintained correctly, so it fires up with gusto, and it make a nice throaty rumble out of the Thursh dual exhaust.  Out on the road, the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, front disc brakes, and BF Goodrich T/A tires come together to make for the perfect cruising package.   ", "  This is the cool Mustang that has been upgraded for a unique performance appearance, extra power, and plenty of rumble.  That makes it a great package for a quite a nice price.

pleased to present this rare and restored 1967 Dodge Coronet R/T 440.   HISTORY  The Coronet R/T was available as a two-door hardtop or convertible. Standard engine was Chrysler's largest, the 440-cid V-8, it was tweaked to 375 bhp and christened the Magnum. The only engine option was the 426-cid Hemi, now in its second year in \"Street\" trim and again rated at 425 bhp. It added $908. Transmission choices were Mopar's excellent heavy-duty three-speed TorqueFlite automatic or a four-speed manual.  When the 426-ci Hemi was made available to the general public for the 1966 model year, it could be ordered in any Coronet model or trim level. No Hemi-powered Coronet wagons have been verified, but a few Coronet Deluxe four-door sedans are known to exist. A total of just 136 Coronet 500 Street Hemis were built for 1966. Beginning in 1967, Chrysler decided that the Hemi should be available only in their badged muscle cars: the Dodge Charger and Coronet R/T and the Plymouth Belvedere GTX. The top engine option for the rest of the Coronet line was supposed to be the 383-ci, 4-barrel V8. Despite this, some Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet Deluxe two-door sedans were produced. There is also one Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 440 two-door hardtop known, and One Hemi-powered 1967 Coronet 500 two-door hardtop known, which is not among the 55 WO23 Super Stock cars produced for Dodge drag racers.

Coming from a warm, dry climate, you know it's clean, and a strong-running 350, lots of options, and handsome two-tone paint make it just a little nicer than your average pickup.  ", "  We're seeing more and more of these trucks getting complete makeovers, and someone obviously spend a good chunk of change getting this one into shape. Fortunately, this truck needed very little surgery to look this good, and while the paint is a few years old, it still has a decent shine that looks just right on the vintage pickup. They did things right and it's obvious that most of the trim was removed for the respray, polished up, and reinstalled to add to its well-dressed look. The long bed and regular cab are arguably the best combination for a truck that might still do some work on weekends, and it gives the truck great proportions and a purposeful look. And speaking of hauling, the bed is well preserved, with very little evidence of having been a work truck in its past, and it's protected by a spray-in bedliner and a heavy-duty rubber mat, so don't be afraid to put it to work now and then.  ", "  The interior is basic, as you'd expect, but there are a few upgrades that make it fun to drive. The bench seat carries a dark green vinyl seat cover that might just be original, although it's in pretty darned nice shape if that's the case. The dash and door panels are in excellent condition, offering body-colored details to make it all work together, and the factory instrument panel includes restored speed and fuel level gauges, with secondary dials underneath. The original radio is still in the dash, but for entertainment, this one uses a hidden AM/FM/CD stereo that's a vast improvement over the factory AM unit. Other features include working factory A/C, power brakes and steering, and a heavy-duty rubber mat on the floor so you don't have to worry about getting it dirty.  ", "  We believe the engine is the original 350 cubic inch V8, rebuilt 3250 miles ago and ready for another 40 years of reliable service. The OEM-spec engine bay looks tidy and it remains mostly stock, including the original air cleaner atop the Chevy Orange engine. There's also a new power brake booster, a big alternator, and a giant radiator up front to keep things nice and cool. The A/C has been converted to R134a refrigerant for easy service and original exhaust manifolds dump into a custom dual exhaust system that sounds just right. A TH350 3-speed automatic transmission shifts crisply and powers the original rear end, which has reasonable gears inside to make this a great all-around vehicle. Factory steel wheels wear original hubcaps for a real 1970s look and it rides on whitewall radials that ride and handle well.  ", "  If you're looking for a handsome, clean old truck that runs well and offers plenty of style, you've just found it.

It just seemed to hit the sweet spot of serious V8 power, affordability, and style that made them an icon, and this cherry red 1970 example represents it all so well.  ", "  The first thing you notice on this coupe is the shimmer of the red paint.  The luster you see here tells you there has been a solid investment in this coupe. And the extra shine lets you really appreciate the fastback profile every time the sunshine hits it.  This is the perfect backdrop for all the brightwork.  The bumpers are like chrome kings, and the 15-inch Weld racing wheels help hint at the performance upgrades.   And we especially love how the louvered pattern of the SS grille coordinates with the trim on the hood and even coordinates with the rear SS panel.  It's a truly attention-grabbing total package.  ", "  Inside, you're greeted by comfortable gray cloth on both rows of seating.  This has been customized with stitching in the headrests, rear seat, and door panels for a touch of flair.  You'll slip behind the leather and chrome sports steering wheel, and then catch sight of plenty more performance upgrades.  There's a large AutoMeter tach, shift light, auxiliary gauge trio, and B&M shifter.  All of this tells you senses that your favorite soundtrack might not be coming from the AM/FM/CD stereo.... Instead it starts under the hood.  ", "  There's only about 4,000 miles on the motor, so that's why it looks so fresh.  The flame-etched air topper, valve covers, alternator, pulleys, and all those other polished components make this V8 look like it's radiating power from within the dark engine bay.  But more than just look mean, this one has the performance to back it up.  You're looking at a 355 cubic-inch motor that has been enhanced with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, hi-rise intake, and a roller cam.  That means you have plenty of rumble out of the dual exhaust, and plenty of power for the streets.  But this build also has the right supporting components.  This includes an aluminum radiator to keep it all cool, a Positraction rear end to offer the right grip, and a TH350 three-speed automatic that's stout enough for to shift through the power and easy enough for automatic cruising.  Add in power steering and front disc brakes, and you have one impressive total package.

You don't see many of the Tri-Five Chevy Wagons, unless its a Nomad and priced out of this hemisphere. This example hails from Tennessee, remains very clean, is finished in Dark Blue Metallic, and has cool story to go with it. The original owner did the paint and interior in 1991. He passed away and his daughter in Iowa inherited the car. She put in a crate 350ci/350hp V8 in 2012, right before our client purchased the car. He has owned it for 5 years now and during his tenure of ownership, he installed power disc brakes, power steering, vintage AC system, and RainGear electric wipers. He also added custom wheels, powder coated wheel wells, chrome engine components, SS Braided Lines, new battery in rear, roll down rear windows - option in 1957, and a custom built high volume radiator and air conductor with electric fans. The car can be driven anywhere in any temperature. No overheating or leaks.    This is an awesome looking and performing Tri-Five wagon, which has been tastefully modified. It has been a local car show winner here in Michigan, but has always been stored indoors. This is a great classic car with enough room for the whole family. Perfect for the cruise-in nights or a weekend trip to the beach. Call or e-mail if interested. At this price, we don't anticipate it being available for long. Thank you for looking.
