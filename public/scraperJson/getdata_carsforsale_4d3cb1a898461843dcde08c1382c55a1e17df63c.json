HISTORY  The Ford Mustang was brought out five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00c2\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964\u00c2\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

Only has a documented 40761 true miles. The came out of Virginia two owner car. The original owner was handicap and had hand controls to operate the gas and brakes, the brake pedal does not show any wear and the gas pedal has a screw hole. The car was repainted on the outside but care was taken to not over spray the original door jams, bottom of hood and bottom of truck lid and inside the trunk, all of those areas have the original paint. Paint is Tahoe Turquoise U code and the interior is 47 is Aqua. All of the interior is original, dash pad, steering wheel, door panels even the head liner is original. The instrument cluster is original and the chrome plating is original and looks new. It has the factory AM radio and it works. The carpet is original as are the scuff plates, front seat cover has wear on it and the beading has come loose on driver side. It has a original set of Ford optional head rests that where install at dealer, all ash trays were never used and even the lighter looks new. The rear package tray is original. The trunk has the original jack, spare tire and it has the original trunk mat. The car came with the steel wheels paint the color of car and had the dog pan hub caps which goes with the car and they look great! I like the style steel wheels on it and the radial tires they make for a great ride. The engine is original and only has 40K miles on it, runs great had new plugs, plug wires, and coil replaced, I am changing the coil to the correct yellow top and the correct Autolite plug wires. It still has the original starter solenoid with the correct part number and even the A/C compressor switch is correct, Also going to Change out the Battery cables to the correct ones. I have pictures of them in the trunk. Power steering works great and the same for the transmission. The exhaust was changed from a single to duals and sounds great! New rear leaf springs were installed to get the correct ride height with new shackles. This is a mostly original car that was well taken care of and the mileage is low because some years it wasnt driven but a few hundred miles. The under side was under coated at dealer or factory, I have not seen any rust or rust repair. the body is straight and doors close like new.
