This early production car (VIN: 101704) was one of only 1,458 to receive a cast iron PowerGlide transmission (since replaced with a better aluminum case PowerGlide) and one of only 1,363 to be finished in the beautiful Fawn Beige exterior with matching coves. The (mostly) original Fawn interior is still in very nice presentable shape with no cracks or tears in the seats or dash. The original WonderBar radi and clock still work. Chrome bumpers, grille and stainless trim are also in great condition. Newer Bias-Ply tires and excellent original hubcaps. This was always a convertible top only car and the white soft top and rear window are perfect along with all the door glass and windshield. All factory bonding strips are in place as they should be and no signs of any major repairs are evident. Since the previous owner maintained and drove this car regularly for the last 15 years, the overall paint does show some minor flaws, but nothing that doesn't keep everyone from staring at the beuatiful color combination. OEM off-road exhaust gives this Vette a nice rumble while it runs and drives great. Overall a \"better-than-driver quality\" Corvette, this is a fun and reliable cruiser while not breaking the bank!"], "Exterior:": "Fawn Beige", "Condition:": "Good", "Transmission:": "Auto"}},
