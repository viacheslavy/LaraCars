Following its competitors at Dodge and General Motors, Ford widened the front bodywork to integrate the cab and front fenders together. Going a step further, the F-Series integrated the hood into the bodywork with a clamshell design. The feature would stay part of the F-Series for two decades. The 1960 Ford F-Series models featured a new grille design that incorporated a barbell-like upper portion that linked the more prominent headlight bezels. Below this, down to the bumper, was an area of rectangles.", "Although they didn't look much different on the outside, the 1960 models bore a number of inner improvements that made them better than the models they replaced. These included changes in spring rates, rubber door seals, the exhaust system, and electrical wiring. New lining materials helped to increase brake efficiency, and a larger heater added more warmth to the cab.", "Features & Options", "We have a nice 1960 Ford F100 here at Skyway Classics which has had a restoration and a lot of upgraded parts added to make it a really sweet street truck.", "It is painted in Fire Engine with custom pin striping, a red tonneau cover, and has a wood truck bed.
