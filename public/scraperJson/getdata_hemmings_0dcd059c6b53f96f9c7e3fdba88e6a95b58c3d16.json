Many of us grew up looking out the sky panels of a wagon very much like this, and not many have survived in this condition, so if you're looking to relive some memories and make some new ones, this is an awesome choice.", "Face it, station wagons are cool today. Where else can you get this much sheetmetal, this much interior space, and V8 power for so little cash? A truck? Sure, if you like driving something that handles like a truck. This Olds cruises the highways with an effortless ease that you have to experience to believe. The cream paint is accented with the usual wood appliques, which really is the only way you want your vintage wagon, right? The paint is in absolutely spectacular condition, indicative of someone either really loving this car or spending a ton of cash on it. Either way you're getting something in top condition, ready to rock. This is a big car, make no mistake, but the proportions are excellent and that kick-up at the rear doors visually ties this car to the rest of the Cutlass lineup and provides a great place for a contrasting pinstripe to really dress things up. There's also plenty of chrome, all of which is in excellent shape, with the roof rack showing some minor pitting but other than that, it's pretty impressive.", "The parchment interior is bright, spacious, and ready to hit the road for a family trip. We're guessing that it's been reupholstered, since it's just too nice to be 50 years old, but on the other hand, it looks quite correct and this is obviously a car that's led a good life. There are some very minor signs of use, but no split seams or tears in the upholstery, and all three rows are correctly finished with factory-style materials and patterns. There's also contrasting dark tan carpet throughout the interior, which shows no fading or heavy wear, mostly because there are heavy-duty mats keeping it protected. The driver gets a sporty three-spoke steering wheel and a pair of round instrument pods that cover only the basics of speed and fuel level, so someone has added a set of white-faced auxiliary gauges under the dash. There's also a working AM/FM radio and you just can't beat the view from those awesome roof-mounted windows. There's also an impressive amount of space in back, even with the third-row seat in use.", "Oldsmobile used a potent 330 cubic inch V8 throughout the Cutlass lineup and it's fat torque curve makes this wagon surprisingly quick around town and a superlative high-speed cruiser on the highway. It's nicely detailed with Oldsmobile Gold paint on the valve covers and the traditional bright red air cleaner assembly with ''Jetfire'' decal. It starts easily and purrs smoothly at idle, and thanks to a fresh dual exhaust system with glasspacks and dual Flowmasters, it's got a nice rumble that never gets annoying. A TH400 3-speed automatic is durable and there are highway-friendly gears out back, making this a great choice for road trips. It's pretty original underneath, so don't expect shiny and perfect, but there is no evidence that this car spent any time in winter weather and it looks quite solid indeed. Power steering and power brakes make it an effortless car to drive and the 205/70/14 whitewall radials on the original wheels and wire wheel covers give it the perfect vintage suburban look.", "If you like wagons, you're going to love this Olds. If you're not a wagon guy, it's OK, but maybe you should see what all the fuss is about. This is an awesome family hauler!

Cars that look this good and are custom built for serious performance are rarely this affordable.  So dig in to all the details, but just know you're not the only one admiring this right now.", "The first generation of the Cutlass never looked better than in '69.   The wraparound chrome bumpers that cleanly integrate into the extra wide front and rear panels; the sporty silhouette of the hardtop design; the flying buttress rear pillars; and sheetmetal that has a sporty kick-up integrated into the rear fender.  This is '60s styling at its best, and you see it perfectly in a coupe treated correct where the doors still shut with authority.  But there's much more going on there than an iconic classic design.  The matte black paint instantly announces a more sinister machine.  And the gloss black on the hood draws attention to the huge power bulge.  Plus, a matching gloss black trunk and 15-inch American Racing wheels add to both the style and enhanced performance attitude.", "When you open the door, you're greeted by custom two-tone seating with a premium diamond pattern insert.  This setup is repeated on the door panels for a great custom appearance.  But while this one is luxurious like a good Olds should be, you also instantly know the coupe is on a pure performance mission.  After all, the roll cage, fire extinguisher, auxiliary gauge trio, and B&M shifter for the stout TH400 three-speed automatic transmission are the perfect accessories to be dragstrip ready.  And as you grab the wood and chrome sports steering wheel, it gives you a clear view at the huge AutoMeter SportComp tach with shift light.  That's a nice indicator that this is one serious coupe.", "Under the hood, you instantly recognize the signs of pure performance.  The big 455 cubic-inch V8 has all the right go-fast goodies, including a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock Torker 455 intake, MSD ignition, and Hooker long tube headers.  Plus, it has been fortified with the right supporting components, like an electric fuel pump, aluminum radiator, and an electric fan.  Not only does this have a ferocious growl out of the dual exhaust, but also when you really want them to hear you coming, there are cutouts so people can fear you by the sound alone.  A good street & strip machine also needs a good suspension, that's why you have a thick sway bar up front, upgraded rear, power steering, and power brakes with disc up front.", "An intimating appearance and ferociously fast coupe meets a terrific price.  It's time to grab this speedy Cutlass before someone else beats you to it.  Call today!!!"], "Exterior:": "Matte Black", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "21918"}},
