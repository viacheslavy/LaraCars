From the straight bodywork that has never been rusty or damaged, to the bright chrome that still shines the way it did in the showroom, this is a big, impressive machine. And compared to the flamboyant Eldorado, the Continental is clean and uncluttered, with trademark hidden headlamps up front and classic horizontal taillights out back. The Wimbledon White repaint is excellent, quite likely better than new, and has a depth and shine befitting a major luxury car like this. The blue vinyl roof is equally nice, with no delamination, bubbles underneath, or split seams.   ", "  While a lot of luxury cars of the era received some rather questionable fabric selections, this car carries fresh blue upholstery with a textured surface that's comfortable and stylish. There's room for six, and every luxury and convenience feature designers could dream up was standard equipment. It's equipped with features such as A/C, power windows, power front seat, a tilt steering column, cruise control, and an AM/8-track radio in the center of the dash. Better still, thanks to the comprehensive restoration, everything seems to work properly save for the power locks, which seem a little confused (the front doors lock when the rears unlock, probably nothing more than a vacuum hose in need of rerouting). The carpets and door panels are like new, the headliner is taut, and there are heavy-duty floor mats to keep everything looking its best. Rear seat area is as massive as you'd expect and the trunk is outfitted with plush mats and a spare tire up on its own shelf.  ", "  Lincolns carried Ford's indestructible 460 cubic inch V8, the biggest ever offered by the company. Smooth, powerful, and easy to service, it's the ideal powerplant for a big luxury cruiser like this. This one idles so smoothly you're tempted to hit the starter again after it's already running and the show-quality look suggests that someone spent a lot of time under the hood. All the belts and hoses are new and there's a fresh tune-up so it's ready for a cross-country drive, which is really what these cars do best.

Inspired by the Futura show car, the cars were seven inches longer, three inches wider, and had sharp angular lines. Lincoln finally caught up with other manufacturers and offered a wraparound windshield for the first time, the biggest in the industry. The Premiere was Lincoln's new top-of-the-line, relegating the Capri to second-class status. It featured a unique eight-pointed star medallion that was located liberally on the exterior of the car along with gold Premiere nameplates. There was no mistaking what car this was!  The company boldly referred to the car as \"the longest, lowest, most powerful, most wanted Lincoln of all time.\" Ads claimed that women considered Lincoln \"easier to drive than even a small car.\" This was in no small attempt to play catch-up with rival Cadillac and broaden its market appeal, yet sales remained only a third that of Cadillac. In addition to the updated styling, the Premiere rode on a new chassis with full box section rails, white the True-Power V-8 engine grew to 368 cubic inches and 285 horsepower with dual exhausts.  This is one of 19,465 Premier Sedans built for 1956, making it Lincoln's second most popular model. Power windows and a four-way power seat were included at no cost, along with power steering and power brakes. Considered by collectors among the most attractive Lincolns of the 1950s, the body style lasted just two years, only to be replaced by an even larger, unitized construction model for 1958.  This stylish Lincoln is quality older restoration that has been very well maintained. the restoration included new paint, chrome, and interior on a nicely equipped original car. Painted in its original and oh-so-fifties appropriate shade of Amethyst, it is echoed inside with pink leather seats and door panels, along with contrasting textured grey fabric inserts, while the dashboard, carpet, and door trim are black. Fully equipped, it features a Town and Country radio with rear speaker; automatic transmission, power steering, brakes, windows, and seat; dual outside rearview mirrors and accessory fog lights. It rides on appropriate wide whitewall tires with correct Premiere wheel covers. Both the engine compartment and the trunk have been highly detailed.

Not only did it consolidate the Lincoln model line into one car it represented a philosophical shift in approach that not only saved the company but transformed Lincolns image. Previous Lincolns were enormous cars that never achieved their intended purpose of representing a credible threat to Cadillac lacking the prestige and styling coherence necessary to win buyers in large numbers. With Lincoln a major loss leader the division was very nearly axed in 1958 and the 1961 Continental was to be the brands last chance. Accordingly the car took a dramatically different direction than the previous models. The cars size was significantly decreased in every dimension being over a foot shorter in length and the styling took a fresh new start. The rear doors were hinged at the rear purportedly to aid ingress and egress with the new smaller packaging and became one of the cars trademark features. The appearance of the new car was clean modernistic and elegant more van der Rohe and less baroque and frivolous. There were no extraneous decorations or panoramic windscreens the fins were small and the entire car had a sophisticated execution that contrasts sharply with the whimsical chromed monsters of the 1950s.The Continental also brought a new focus on quality and craftsmanship. The new unitized construction permitted a more solid platform and the Continental became the first car to offer a 2 year 24000 mile warranty. Each engine was bench tested for 3 hours and every car was road tested prior to delivery as well. The corporate ethos behind the car was to produce the finest mass-produced domestic car of its time and most will agree that the Continental succeeded. It is no surprise then that the car became intimately associated with John F. Kennedy and his progressive New Frontier representing a serious and forward-looking perspective that eschewed somewhat the bigger is better mentality of the 1950s. The Continental was particularly appropriate for the administration because it was the only postwar American car that was available as a four door convertible although it was ultimately in the back of a Continental convertible that JFK was assassinated.Produced from 1961 to 1969 most agree that the 1964 and earlier examples best exemplify the restrained elegance and purposeful modernity of the original design. The 1963 models were mildly repackaged to permit more interior and trunk space without changing the exterior dimensions and the electrical system was changed to accommodate an alternator in place of the generator. New front and rear grilles rounded out the exterior changes while a four barrel carburetor increased the power output.In any given year convertibles accounted for about 10% of Continental production making them particularly rare and sought after. In 1963 3138 convertible Continentals were built and this particular car is a wonderful example that has been restored to the highest possible standards and shown extensively since. In the 63 times that the car has been shown since its restoration it has won an award each and every time that it was judged (55 times)  giving it legitimate claim to the possibility of being one of the finest examples extant.This example was sold new in California and was serviced twice in 1963 at Marshall Clampett Lincoln Ford in Los Angeles. The car was owned in the 1980s by Loren Smith president of Orchard Supply Hardware (OSH). The cars current owner was good friends with Smith who spoke frequently of his friend Don whom he indicated would be very disappointed if he were to drive a car that was not made in the United States. The cars current owner came to learn upon Smiths death in 1990 that Dons full name was Don Peterson and that he was the chairman of Ford Motor Company.

Yes, Lincolns! Cars like this 1954 Lincoln Capri were renowned for their big horsepower, tidy handling, and bulletproof construction, making them a favorite among competitors in the grueling (and deadly) Carrera Panamericana cross-country races held in Mexico.   ", "  Of course, this handsome Capri sedan was never a race car, but the same virtues that made it popular with racers also serve it well on the streets. The tidy proportions bely the massive luxury machines Lincoln would become later in the decade, but the upscale design and ornamentation leave no doubt that this was a top-of-the-line car in 1954. The Ivy Green paint is a refreshing change from the pastels and plain black sedans of the period, and helps the car stand out without being undignified, which wouldn't suit a Lincoln at all. Finish quality is excellent and it's just a quick polish and wax away from being truly spectacular. It's got a great shine and the bodywork underneath is laser-straight, suggesting it has never been wrecked or rusty, and all four doors close with that incredibly solid ker-chunk sound that is always so reassuring. Plenty of chrome and stainless trim ensures nobody will mistake this for anything but a Lincoln, and it remains in first-class condition throughout, including the wonderful taillight housings and ornaments ahead of the rear wheels.  ", "  We have a lot of reasons to believe the interior is original, from the handsome patterned cloth upholstery to the ornate tri-tone door panels that blend into the dashboard. It's possible that the carpets have been replaced at some point, but even they have some patina that makes everything look consistent. It's loaded with power options, which should be expected on a car of this stature, including a power seat, power windows, and cold A/C, which appears to be an early add-on unit under the dash and not built into the trunk the way the factory would have done it. Either way, it's effective and most of the hardware tucks neatly out of sight. Sliding levers for the ventilation controls, an array of simple gauges, and an AM radio built into the dash instead of simply jammed into a slot all give it a very neatly finished look. We especially like the patterned applique that covers the glove box and wraps into the door panels, making the Capri feel light-hearted and not at all frumpy like most luxury cars of the period. And you do get a giant truck with an original mat and full-sized spare with jack assembly.  ", "  The 317 cubic inch V8 was all-new in 1954 and with overhead valves, power was way up over the flathead before it. The unusual exhaust manifold arrangement makes it easy to spot, and it appears to be mostly original under the hood, including the gold air cleaner and valve covers. You'll find both power brakes and power steering on the options list, and someone has insulated the fenders and air intake to make th"], "title": "1954 Lincoln Capri ", "total_results": "244", "price": "24995", "kilometers": 110609.096, "total_pages": 12, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/28374643", "brand": "Lincoln", "reference_id": "28374643", "year": "1954", "model": "Capri", "specs": {"Engine": "317.5 c.i.", "Mileage": "68,744 miles", "Exterior Color": "Ivy Green", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Green", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

This triple blue land yacht is ready to cruise you around in style. At just over 19 feet long the Mark V was the largest of the Mark series and was also the best seller for Lincoln at the time. Since new driving this vehicle is like stepping back in time to the luxury and opulence of the late \u00c3\u00a2??70\u00c3\u00a2??s. The long slender lines along with the opera windows, vinyl roof, hideaway headlights and shiny chrome trim makes a true statement as you float down the road. The large seats are upholstered in Jade velour which was a pricy option and are very soft and comfortable to sit in. This car was fully loaded when new and features power windows, power locks, heated outside mirrors, working 8-track player, power driver and passenger seat, aluminum alloy wheels, climate control and working Cartier clock. The Mark V really stands out with the pointed front fenders, functional side fender louvers that aided in cooling the engine and the classic hump back trunk. From top to bottom this is a very clean and well maintained original Lincoln that will turn heads wherever you go. The 460 Cubic inch V8 starts right up and runs as smooth as silk. The original automatic transmission shifts very nice as this dream boat cruises you back in time.

The Continental was introduced in 1940 as an exclusive, luxurious, handcrafted automobile for the status conscious consumer.    The early Continental was recognized by the Museum of Modern Art as one of eight automotive 'works of art' and by Time magazine as one of the top ten best-designed commercial products. The post-war design was a continuation of the short-lived 1942 model but with a heavier grille. Continentals continued to be a top-of-the-line automobile and were highly desired after the war. Many luxury features were standard.
