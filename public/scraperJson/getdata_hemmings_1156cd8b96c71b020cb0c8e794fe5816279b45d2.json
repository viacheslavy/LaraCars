The car features gull-wing doors and an innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis along with external brushed stainless-steel body panels. It became widely known and iconic for its appearance and it was modified to represent the concept of a time machine in the Back to the Future media franchise.  In 1995 a new separate company started reproducing new build cars to the open market.  This one is all original though.  The engine is a Peugeot-Renault-Volvo (PRV) 2.85 litre V6 which produced about 130 hp that was designed and built under special contract with the DMC Company. These PRV engines were a development of the 2.7 liter V6 in the Renault 30 and were built in the PRV Factory in Douvrin Northern France. The gearbox also designed by PRV was built at the Renault facility near Caen in Normandy.  The suspension of the DMC-12 is a four-wheel independent suspension coil springs and telescopic shock absorbers. The front suspension uses double wishbones while the rear is a multi-link setup. In its original development stages the car is said to have handled quite well.  The DMC-12 could achieve 0\"?60 miles per hour (0\"?97 km/h) in 8.8 seconds when equipped with a manual transmission. When equipped with an automatic transmission the DeLorean would accelerate from 0\"?60 miles per hour (0\"?97 km/h) in 10.5 seconds.  This one has only 17651 miles on it and is in fantastic condition.  It has the 3-speed automatic transmission.  Both the engine & transmission are healthy are run well.  The exterior panels are free from any major dents or scratches.  The leather interior is also in great shape with only a couple of cracks on the dash which was a common issue with these cars.   Features on this DeLorean include; AC (not blowing cold) AM/FM radio power brakes power windows tilt steering wheel seat belts leather interior & aluminum wheels.   The owner has rebuilt the entire fuel system back in 2010 a new alternator new starter AC belt & many other recent maintenance item receipts that will go with the car.

Contrary to popular opinion he very nearly succeeded; the factory got built, all in the remarkably short period of three years. The innovative stainless steel body and hulling doors were well integrated into a strikingly attractive design by legendary Italian stylist Giorgetto Giugiaro; even today a DMC-12 will stop traffic like few other cars. However, cash flow issues, and a bleak economical climate, sales eventually overwhelmed the company, and forced them into receivership in 1982.This lovely example on offer is fitted with a rare manual gearbox and shows just 13,000Kilometers on the odometer. In good condition throughout this low mileage example is offered with EU tax documentation. This must be one of the best DMC-12s on the market today.
