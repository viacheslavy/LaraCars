You absolutely could not duplicate this A-code pony with a strong-running 289 4V engine and a 4-speed for the asking price, even if you got the car for free. Bright red paint, a beautiful interior, and a lot of charisma make this a fantastic way to get into the Mustang hobby without a major investment.  ", "  Repainted in what appears to be Signal Flare Red, this handsome coupe looks like a million bucks. Originally hailing from down south where it's spent most of its life, the familiar Mustang sheetmetal is crisp and sharp thanks to expert restoration work. They built a lot of Mustangs, most of them coupes just like this, but that doesn't mean they're not handsome, timeless cars, and except for perhaps a Corvette or a Porsche 911, there aren't many cars that are more recognizable around the world. This one has been dressed up with white stripes, bright rocker panel moldings, and shiny chrome on the bumpers, it's nicely detailed in the way you'd want your Mustang to look. It's not a fake GT, not dressed up like some Shelby wanna-be, just a clean coupe that totally nails the factory look. The result is cheerful and appropriate, making this a car you'll be proud to show at any level because it fits together so well.  ", "  A handsome black Pony interior is a very desirable upgrade, and it's authentically restored with great detailing and attention to the little things. Look how neatly the seat covers fit, with just the right amount of padding underneath to create a supportive seat that doesn't look over-stuffed. Crisply marked gauges are all fully functional, another detail that you just don't see in cars priced like this, and the original AM radio still lives in the dash, which is an increasingly rare find. There's a 4-speed shifter sticking out of the transmission tunnel, so you know this neat coupe means business, and if you look closely, you'll spot the Disc Brakes emblem on the brake pedal, something that was still a novelty in 1966. Add in a fat wood-rimmed steering wheel, correct door panels, and a taut headliner, and it's hard to see how anyone could come out right-side-up financially with a sticker price like this. Interiors this nice are EXPENSIVE. The trunk also features a correct plaid mat and a pretty tired spare tire.  ", "  And this isn't just some 6-cylinder beater, either. For that price, you're getting a legitimate A-code 289, fully rebuilt and detailed. Someone took the time to do it right, as there's Ford Blue paint on the engine itself, a high-performance air cleaner assembly, vintage power steering pump, and a set of finned valve covers that look great. There's a Holley double-pumper carburetor on top of an aluminum intake manifold for a few extra horsepower, and it spins to life easily with a nice bark from the fresh dual exhaust system. The 4-speed clicks through the gears with authority, and 3.00 gears out back make it an excellent highway cruiser.

We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this rare Mustang!  HISTORY  From 1967 until 1973, the Mustang got bigger but not necessarily more powerful. The Mustang was facelifted, giving the Mustang a more massive look overall and allowing a big block engine to be offered for the first time. Front and rear end styling was more pronounced, and the \"twin cove\" instrument panel offered a thicker crash pad, and larger gauges. Hardtop, fastback and convertible body styles continued as before. Around this time, the Mustang was paired with a Mercury variant, called the Cougar, which used its own styling cues, such as a \"cougar's head\" logo and hidden quad headlamps. New safety regulations by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for 1967 included an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way emergency flashers, a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system, and softer interior knobs.
