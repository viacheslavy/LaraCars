Not only was this the first year for Corvettes to be produced at two factories but it was also the first year for the now historic Bowling Green plant. The STL plant cars were only available in solid colors while the new revolutionary bowling green plant had the capability to paint them two tone a rather extravagant option for a production car in 1981. With the odometer showing a mere 46235 actual miles this beauty has lived a pampered life. The bright red metallic paint brings out the lines of the 81 nicely. Under that long hood is the classic small block Chevy that came in the car backed by the original Turbo 350 Hydramatic transmission.  The T-tops are in excellent condition and have the tinted look which makes the red paint pop even more. Take them off and the wind will be blowing through hair in no time. With the black leather seats looking as new as the paint this Corvette has everything you would look for in a classic. The polished wheels are in excellent condition and are something that you just don\"??t see any more. Options on this 1981 Chevrolet Corvette include; AC AM/FM/8-track player Glass T tops Cruise Power Brakes Power Steering Power Windows Power Locks Power Seats Telescopic/ Tilt Wheel Leather Interior Polished Aluminum Wheels Wrapped with Radial Tires that have Raised Lettering.
