This 1985 Corvette is a fast, fun entry-level 'Vette with no vices, excellent originality, and lots of documentation.", "It's rather rare to find an unmodified Corvette of this vintage, but this one has obviously led a very easy life as a fair-weather toy. Showing just 68,311 original miles, the bodywork remains in great shape, and while Corvettes of this period are known for being hardcore, this one has aged very gracefully with no cracks or obvious signs of hard use, and the shiny Medium Gray Metallic paint suggests that someone spent a lot of Saturday afternoons lovingly washing and waxing its sleek surface. The slippery gray paint itself is ideal, the perfect look for the high-tech 1980s, and if you think a gray Corvette can't be a hardcase, guess again, because this one rocks. The black rub strip that surrounds the body adds contrast and shows no UV damage, and the tinted windows combine with a smoked acrylic top to give it a no-nonsense look that really works. For a car that's more than three decades old, this one looks a fraction of its age.", "The C4 had a state-of-the-art interior in 1985 and it has aged well, both in terms of design and in this car's case, preservation as well. The leather seats are called ''Graphite'' and it works extremely well with the gray bodywork. Showing modest wear that's appropriate for its age and mileage, the interior is comfortable and inviting, but definitely performance-oriented with a driver-centric instrument panel full of digital gauges that are still bright and easy to read. Carpets and door panels show excellent preservation, as does the cargo area out back. Turn the key and the dash comes to life, and you have all the options at your fingertips: cold A/C, power windows and locks, cruise control, a tilt wheel, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo that still sounds great.", "Crossfire injection was dead, and the all-powerful L98 debuted in 1985. Torquey and as reliable as a mule, the 350 cubic inch V8 provided Corvette power for years and remains one of GM's better efforts. It's also insanely easy to modify, with a vast aftermarket designed around it. But a modified engine is also one that's been used hard, but you're in luck because this one remains bone stock. From the distinctive intake manifold to the finned aluminum valve covers, it remains clean and well-maintained, and thanks to GM electronics, it still starts instantly and idles like it should every single time. The 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission snaps off downshifts with only a light prod, yet cruises effortlessly at highway speeds and actually pulls down decent fuel mileage. The exhaust system is new and sounds awesome, the suspension still delivers impressive grip, and the brakes are powerful, even by today's standards. Original 16-inch alloys are in excellent shape and wear fat 255/50/16 performance radials that really fill the fenders.", "It's hard to go wrong with a Corvette of any kind, but this one that also includes a ton of documentation, factory books, and window sticker is a smart choice.
