And the red triple rocker stripe is the perfect reminder that these were the cars of the weekend warriors.  Plus, it has all the right brightwork elements you love like the form-hugging bumpers, side scoops, Mustang-branded gas cap, and great factory wheel covers with the Mustang logo in the middle.", "The red rocker stripes also do a great job of matching the factory-correct red interior \u2013 giving the coupe a very coordinated appearance.  It all looks great, so we bet there has been an investment in all the right places like carpets, door panels, and the seats. Everyone gets to enjoy the newer AM/FM stereo with digital tuner that fits cleanly into the original radio's knob-style opening.  The center console is a great place to rest your elbow when holding onto the gearshift.  It's a more modern piece that purists can remove, but we do like the idea of having extra conveniences like cup holders. And like any good Mustang, this is very driver-oriented with a sporty three-spoke steering wheel that gives you a clear view of the full gauge package.", "Since the interior and exterior are so distinctive, the engine bay follows suit, too.  Instead of an overblown V8, this cool cruiser keeps its original-style 170 cubic-inch inline-six.  Once the 1964.5 production switched over to 1965, this motor was gone.  So it's a cool piece of history to have this correct displacement still under the hood.  The same goes for the generator.  After all, it could easily be switched to an alternator, but it has been kept in this one all these years because Mustang people know to look for this special short-run feature.  And you know this has been a cherished classic by the proper presentation with features like the red valve cover, matching air topper, and even the correct coolant bag.  So you know Mustang people will marvel when you lift the hood at car shows.  Out on the road, the three-speed manual gives you good control over the motor, and it makes for a lively driving experience.  After all, the Mustang was built on the idea of being a practical car for the weekdays and something fun for the weekends, and this example does exactly that.", "Comfortable, affordable, and exceptionally unique \u2013 this one is for someone who appreciates the heart of the first-year Mustang and its culture.  We might love V8 Mustangs (and have plenty to show you) but this is something distinctly different. If you're someone who truly appreciates why this is the all-American classic, call today."], "Exterior:": "White", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "44187"}},

This 1965 Mustang coupe is just the right kind of car to get started in the hobby and no collection is complete without one of Ford's pony cars. It's not perfect, it's not a horsepower monster, but it is a clean, dependable, fun way to have fun in an old car without breaking the bank. No other car can deliver the experience of an early Mustang for so little cash.", "You can hardly go wrong with a classic Wimbledon White Mustang, which means you're going to get a lot of attention. It was never intended to be a show car (coupes just don't command the prices to justify a $10,000 paint job), but it presents rather well and you won't worry about driving it just about anywhere. Rain? No problem. Bugs? Forget about it. Parking lot? No worries. It's got a clean, honest look that works best on coupes and it's been spared the stripes and wings that plague so many other ponies. You'll note that it fits together pretty well, with good gaps and reasonable seams all around, so it has probably never been wrecked or rusty and seems to have led a pretty good life. A few chrome pieces make the Mustang look dressy, including the 1965-only grille with the cross-hairs, the quarter panel insert, and, of course, a shiny gas cap in the center of the rear panel. This is how Mustangs have looked for decades.", "The black bucket seat interior is how this car was originally delivered and it's in very good shape overall. It's probably a combination of original and replacement parts, because some things are just too nice to be 50 years old, including the carpets and the seat covers. There's a deep-dish steering wheel and the standard instruments keep an eye on the basics. The dash pad, headliner, and other soft parts don't need any attention at all, and with an AM/FM/cassette radio powering speakers on the rear package shelf, it's ready to go. The shifter for the 3-speed manual transmission falls easily to hand and looks great between the seats and the back seat is in great shape, too. A neatly finished trunk with a full-sized spare tire makes this car feel complete and ready for a road trip.", "Experts will note that the VIN contains a ''T'' which means a smooth-running 200 cubic inch inline-six, which is hardly a handicap. It's got a legendary reputation for durability and smoothness, and if you look around, you'll find a lot of guys who are very passionate about this engine. It looks quite stock with bright orange paint on the air cleaner and valve cover and black everywhere else, which is how they were delivered in 1965. The transmission shifts crisply and smoothly and with relatively relaxed gears out back, it's a wonderfully efficient car on the highway. The exhaust gives the six a great sound that's a little different than all the V8 cars but never annoying. The important parts are quite solid and blackwall radials on vintage ''kidney bean'' aluminum wheels give it a '60s performance look.", "For entry-level fun, it's hard to beat a Mustang coupe.

Gateway Classic Cars of St. Louis is proud to offer a great little 1967 Ford Mustang.  Ford rewrote the automotive experience when they rolled out the Mustang in 1964.  The most innovative thing about the model was the lengthy options list.  A Mustang could be built to spec however the buyer desired.  There were multiple body styles multiple engines available several transmissions colors interior trim levels and all sorts of equipment options available.  Because of this long list almost no two Mustangs were just alike.  This makes it a fun model to collect because although they made a lot of them each one has its own personality.  This particular example is a 1967 model the first year of a styling change since new.  The 67 model retained the same overall shape but received slightly more muscular hips and a sportier front end.  The interior received a new dash design as well as many subtle trim changes.  This one is finished in bright white and sits on classic styled steel wheels wrapped in raised white letter tires.  The body is straight and solid and would make any Mustang enthusiast proud.  Open the door and inside youll find a unique interior combination which combines a textured brown and tan two tone upholstery.  The seats door panels and dash are all in wonderful shape as well as the wood rimmed steering wheel.  This Mustang runs and drives incredibly well.  The 289 CID V8 makes good power and has a nice exhaust note.  The V8 is backed by a 3 speed automatic which shifts smoothly.  The car benefits from power steering and power brakes to make the driving experience more comfortable.  Another nice option is Air Conditioning.  Overall this is a clean example of one of Americas most popular collector cars.  This would make a great entry level classic as well as fitting in well with any avid collectors collection.

Right up there with baseball apple pie and old glory it doesnt get much more American than a Ford Mustang.  Released in 1964 the first generation had a little bit for everyone.  A massive options list allowed each buyer to spec out their pony however they wanted.  Multiple engines transmissions power options colors and even body style were available.  Within the same model a Mustang could range from a basic coupe with a 6 cylinder and a 3 speed manual to a fire breathing K-Code fastback with a V8 and a 4 speed on the floor.  This particular example is nicely set up with a 289 V8 under the hood and an automatic transmission.  The exterior is finished in a snappy coat of bright orange and it rides on some 5 spoke alloy wheels with healthy tires.  Inside youll find black vinyl upholstery bucket seats and a floor mounted shifter.  These little coupes are great cars to drive.  They arent too big or too small and with an automatic transmission you dont have to be a racecar driver to take this one out for a spin.  Whether youre looking for your first classic car or youre adding to a collection this Mustang would fit the bill.

This car has been thru an extensive mechanical restoration with just under $6000 in parts receipts(can be seen on request), no labor included. The 289 V8 and transmission has been rebuilt, new tires . The body appears to have original interior that is in good shape including new carpet. The car runs great and drives down the road very nicely. We describe our vehicles 100%, you will get what you think your going to get.  This car was inspected by an independent inspector for a prospective buyer and he stated that we described the car exactly as it was and one of the most honest dealers he had ever talked to.  He did not buy the car because something came up in his family.  I persoanlly work and drive my classics so can get you all the information, pictures or video's you need.  The body is solid and has had a repaint at one time that is showing it's age. The original color appears to have been green. Take this car  and give it a high quality repaint and update the interior and you have a true classic Mustang that will show well and drive great.  We are upfront and honest about the condition of our cars so if you would like to have it inspected we welcome all inspectors.  We also can help you with the shipping.
