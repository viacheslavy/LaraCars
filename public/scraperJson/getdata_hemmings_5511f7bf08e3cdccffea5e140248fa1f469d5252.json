They say ''Don't mess with success'', so Ford didn't change anything substantial for '66.   Since then, this car has had just a couple minor upgrades to the original setup, and we now offer you this great looking, great driving, American sports car.", "Red is always a fun color for a sportscar and this one is a classic example of that.  The body lines are crisp and clean and the gaps between the panels are nice and consistent.  Newer chrome all around shines brightly with a thin chrome front bumper leading the way with the familiar galloping Pony in the grill just above it.  That long Mustang hood has Ford in script along the front edge and the front fenders have both a 289 V8 emblem and a red, white and blue Mustang badge on them.  The rockers are dressed out in polished metal and the rear fenders have a splash of flash trimming out the side scoops.  The back of the car has the iconic three lens brake lights, along with a Mustang gas cap.  Just below the rear bumper are twin tailpipes peeking out from under the lower valence.  5-lug steel wheels are black with polished ribs and Mustang centers really look sharp with the Red on this car.", "Open the door and you will find a nice looking black interior.  Have a seat in the comfortable bucket seats that are pleated, woven cloth centers surrounded by smooth vinyl panels and wrap your hands around that three-spoke deep-dish steering wheel trimmed in wood with the Mustang horn button.  It looks good and feels good in your hands.  Through that wheel you will see a stock dashboard with the speedometer in the center and the engine gauges arranged symmetrically on each side.  In the center of the dash is one of the upgrades this car received in the Koss AM/FM/Cassette deck installed for your listening pleasure.  The T-handle shifter for the automatic transmission is mounted in the floor and falls easily to hand.   The carpets are in excellent shape and are protected by a couple nice rubber floormats with a galloping Pony embossed into them.  The headliner is also in excellent condition and finishes out the interior nicely.", "Pop the hood on this car and you will find a 289 V8 that is arguably the most desirable engine to have in an early 'Stang.  This car was delivered from the factory with one, although it is unknown if it was this particular one.  It is nestled down in a neat and clean engine bay with a cross member brace adding some chassis rigidity and the engine has a few upgrades both for a bit of extra power, and bit of extra style.  The chrome air topper looks great sitting on top of a 4-barrel carburetor.  A stock intake manifold and cylinder heads take over from there and then finned aluminum Ford Racing valve covers add a bit of a performance look to it.   A Flamethrower ignition coil provides good spark and Hedman long tube headers flow back to dual chrome exhaust tips. Signs of good maintenance include newer plugs, wires and distributor cap along with newer belts and hoses.  Power flows back through a 3-speed automatic transmission and the rubber meets the road through 205/75R14 tires all around mounted on those black and polished steel wheels.", "Come on down and check out this sharp looking Red '66 'Stang with a couple subtle upgrades.

This little pony was one of the first major redesigns of the early Mustang. Building on the success of the previous 4 years a lot changed for the 1969 Mustang.

It was also now larger and wider to look more muscular and aggressive to compete with Muscle cars in the styling department. When you take that new styling and add an automatic convertible top you have what might be the best looking pony car to ever come out of Detroit. Sporting a 5 speed manual gear box and a 351 Cleveland V8 this car has the gumption to easily impress you in the seat dyno and spin tires. You\"??ll more than appreciate the ease and fun of driving this hopped up pony car. This wonderful 1969 Mustang sports a white automatic convertible top a deep Dark Maple paint vinyl interior power steering radial tires rally wheels and am radio.

Setting this Mustang apart from rest of the crowd is a custom Shelby style front end and hood American Racing Torque Thrust wheels and lowered stance that really set off the performance feel. Giving it the lowered stance and helping it to out corner its stock counterpart is a set of TCP adjustable coil overs upfront and newer lower leaf springs in the rear. Also helping it to corner is the Flaming River power rack and pinion cradle that was a huge improvement from the factory equipment. The remanufactured 302 cubic inch V8 sitting under the hood has been tuned up to give it that extra power it needed. Modifications include the Weind aluminum intake manifold and 4-barrel carburetor a mild cam giving it a healthy choppy idle and a set of Hedman long-tube headers flowing through a full Flowmaster exhaust system. Backing up that small block Ford engine is a brand new performance C4 automatic transmission that shifts crisply between gears. Helping to add to the reliability of this Mustang it was completely rewired using an American Autowire Mustang harness and an aluminum radiator was installed along with an electric fan to keep it cool. This Mustang has been well sorted out and has a great deal of classy touches throughout.

The previous Tennessee title tells us that it lived in that state with the two known long-term previous owners and with the last one since 1983. Less than three years ago, our seller was fortunate to find such a solid and remarkably well cared for Mustang to bring to Michigan for fair weather and Summer enjoyment. During 2016 and 2017, he decided to make sure of the carefree drivability and took it to a trusted mechanic specializing in Fords and invested about twenty thousand dollars in the restoration, safety enhancements and maintenance of anything that the mechanic suggested should be done to bring it to the highest level of dependability. Receipts for this work will go with the sale. This Mustang is truly stunning in Red with a White Pony Deluxe Interior and a White Convertible Top. It has the Deluxe optional Wood Steering wheel, Manual 3 Speed Transmission with a special Hurst Shifter. It has Front Disc Brakes and a Dual Master Cylinder. The Wheels are the 15 Styled Steel. Only 3,837 miles show on the odometer representing the mileage since the mechanical work was completed.

The first generation of Mustang was built from late 1964 through essentially 1973 with subtle changes. The most iconic of all engines put in the Mustangs was the 289 Cubic Inch V8 that saw subtle power increases as the years went on.  The car was designed as a hard top, and convertible based on a 4- seat configuration. This particular Pony has been meticulously amateur restored using all of the original drivetrain and body parts. Although the restoration has been several years, we have found that it has been done to very good standards with all of the correct body panels with VIN codes still correct. The drivetrain is in excellent working order that starts, runs and drives very well. Finished in its excellent colors of Black over Fawn with new convertible top that is in excellent working and easy to operate power option.  Everything is in working order, making it a excellent cruiser and local car show contender.
