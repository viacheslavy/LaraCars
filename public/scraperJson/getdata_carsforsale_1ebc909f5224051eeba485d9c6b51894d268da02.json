The attention to detail on this Mustang is incredible, the builder even put thought in to making it something you could jump in and drive with cold air conditioning, upgraded custom leather bucket seats, and a 7-speaker sound system. Getting you to the car show in style and with speed, your power train includes a fresh 351 Windsor backed by a 5 speed Tremec transmission. Making the ride comfortable is the new Heidt\u00c3\u00a2??s front coil over suspension, and you don\u00c3\u00a2??t have to worry about stopping with those big Wilwood disk brakes all the way around! Once you get to the show, simply hit the hide-a-plate key fob and watch your front plate disappear under the car so you can show off that custom all steel front bumper.

Gateway Classic Cars is proud to present this classic Pony Car finished in stunning Ford Candy Apple red and has recently undergone a two-year complete restoration. No detail of this Mustang was overlooked during the restoration including the installation of a upgraded and potent 289 engine that was built to 271 HP specs. From the dual point style distributor, 3-inch harmonic balancer, low restriction exhaust manifolds with dual full-length exhaust to the high-rise aluminum intake manifold this small block Ford means business.  They will know at the car shows and cruise ins when you fire it up that there is no plain vanilla 289 under the hood of this red rocket!  Getting this power to the ground is the tough Ford top-loader 4 speed transmission and beefy P225 60R15 BFG T/A radial tires on chrome Ford style \u00c3\u00a2??GT\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d steel wheels. This Mustang drives as good as it looks with smooth shifting into all gears and the very responsive engine pushing you into the seat while making great exhaust sounds. The power front disc brakes are the 4-piston Kelsey Hayes type that offer excellent stopping power to slow this pony down from a spirited sprint down that straightaway! This car is tight and drives and stops as it should, you will also have easy going in the parking lot with the factory power steering. The body and paint of this Mustang can only be described as spectacular with very straight sheet metal and extremely nice paint work, from all appearances this was a expensive and top-quality restoration. The underside of this car is just as nice as the body and looks like it just rolled out of the Ford factory, in fact the factory didn\u00c3\u00a2??t built them this nice in 1966! There have been sub-frame connectors added to improve chassis stiffness and upgrade the handling and all under chassis parts look to be new.   Have a seat in this magnificent machine and you will be equally impressed with the interior. It is all new, from the Haartz convertible automatic soft-top that works flawlessly to the optional and highly desirable optional Pony seating, it is all just as the Ford designers intended. This car also has the Ford \u00c3\u00a2??Rally-Pac\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d gauge option mounted to the steering column that includes a clock and 8,000 rpm tach that both work. It also sports the full console with cubby and fog lights.So here is the visual, a wide open road, a clear blue sky and the top down, you are behind the wheel of this stunning classic convertible Ford Mustang with a very big smile on your face, if you just happen to turn on the AM radio you may hear a Beach Boys or Beatles tune and a news flash on the progress of the space race!

Sloppy steering, less than stellar acceleration and a loose, squeaky suspension often come to mind. This 1966 Mustang Restomod is an inspired combination of modern technology with old school motoring vibe, all wrapped in a unique and well-executed package that's sure to turn heads.   ", "  Ford's Lime Gold was a signature color for Mustangs of the late 60's and it's employed to great use in this inspired reimagining that adds a wide swath of black running from front to back over the scooped hood, hardtop and trunk all the way to the taillight panel against that nostalgic backdrop.  It's not just an eye-catching color scheme but it's also very well applied, with a smooth, glass-like finish from all angles. The chrome and trim all over - including the front and back bumpers, light bezels and window trim - all have an unblemished shine. Look closer up front and you'll see a set of fog lights hidden behind that new looking grille. Go around to the back and you'll see a set of clean chrome bezels surrounding the dual exhaust in the rear valance, a very cool finishing touch.   ", "  Once you look inside, the quality and inspired design of this interior are immediately obvious. There are some very cool touches here, as the color scheme of the exterior has been ably brought in: a primarily lime gold dash with black inserts is crowned by a new dashpad, and the lime gold door interiors surround matching black inserts of their own. Look in the back and you'll see another unique touch - the areas straddling the black back bench seat also carry that lime gold hue on their steel surfaces, unobscured by any quarter panel trim inside. The front black buckets and rear bench don't seem to have seen much use at all and their restored design has a very tasteful and comfortable look: aftermarket but very much right at home in this classic. Peer through the custom steering wheel and you'll see a set of aftermarket Dakota gauges fit seamlessly into the stock design of the instrument bezel - a combination of updated technology blended with a vintage look. There are also some great add-ons to improve the driving experience, including a chrome Ididit tilt column and a top-quality Rockford- Fosgate AM/FM system with iPod connectivity powering a set of speakers expertly installed in those front kick panels.   ", "  There's plenty of GO to match the SHOW here. A 347 stroker V8 engine sits as the foundation of the drivetrain and with its Crane Cam and MSD ignition, it's sure to provide all the power you could want. It's paired to a C4 3 speed transmission with highway-friendly 3.08 gears in the back. A generously-sized aluminum radiator sits in front to keep temperatures down and a billet serpentine pulley system adds yet another visual element to a nice clean co"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1966 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "", "price": "38995", "kilometers": 1670.142, "total_pages": 46, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/34988262", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "34988262", "year": "1966", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "347 V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "1,038 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Stock #": "2567-DFW", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Lime Gold", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Lime Gold"}},

If that isn't some powerful branding, I don't know what is. Fortunately, this 1967 Ford Mustang fastback's good looks are more than skin deep. With a built 351 Windsor, a 5-speed, a neatly finished interior, and a few modern tricks up its sleeve, it's the right way to build a vintage Mustang.  ", "  By 1967, Shelby knew that he had a hit, and part of that was a unique look. No longer satisfied with just a set of racing stripes, Ol' Shel developed fiberglass body parts including a hood, custom rear fascia, and in some cases, a chin spoiler. This GT351 nails all the details, and puts them all together in a very convincing way. The fiberglass is actually worlds better than Shelby's original stuff, which often warped out of shape just sitting in the sun. Finish quality is quite good, with great panel alignment, particularly out back where the new deck lid and corner pieces give it a very unique look. Add a set of sequential T-Bird taillights and you have an icon. Assorted scoops complete the look, and then the glowing electric blue paint went on, topped by a full set of Wimbledon White stripes, including custom GT351 callouts on the rockers. EVERYBODY will recognize this Mustang in your garage, but it's so much more than they think.  ", "  The interior is a bit more stylish than the typical Shelby all-black setup, sporting a set of high-back buckets from a 1969 model. It's all in excellent condition, with much of it being restored, including the seat covers, door panels, and dash. The gauges are original and still fully functional, and they include a Shelby-spec 140 MPH speedometer and those two auxiliary dials down on the console, just the way Shelby did it. Entertainment comes from a Custom Autosound stereo head unit in the center of the dash with a CD changer in the trunk. For authenticity, it also carries a rear roll bar and a set of Simpson racing harnesses to lock you in place. Shelby owners loved the fold-down rear seat in the fastback, since it allowed plenty of room for an extra set of wheels and racing tires, making it one of the more practical muscle cars of the era. The trunk is trimmed properly with a reproduction mat and includes a full-sized spare with matching Torque Thrust wheel, which is a nice touch (also note that the stripes wrap into the jambs, a sure sign of quality paint work).  ", "  The engine is a strong-running 351 Windsor V8, which is a neat fit in the Mustang's engine bay. Nicely detailed with a set of Cobra valve covers and oval air cleaner, nobody will mistake it for anything else and things like Edelbrock aluminum heads, 4-barrel carburetor, and an upgraded cam give it the power you'd expect. A few bright aluminum and chrome pieces really pop against the satin black engine bay, and the upgraded hardware includes a big aluminum radiator and a custom shock tower brace setup. The 5-speed manual gearbox is the same piece that li"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "", "price": "63995", "kilometers": 15832.56, "total_pages": 46, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/35028676", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "35028676", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 Windsor V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "9,840 miles", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Stock #": "3908-ATL", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Blue", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Blue"}},

Sit in it and you feel like Steve McQueen. The engine in this car in this car is much better than how they came off the line. Back then they made pretty good torque but weren't that impressive in the power department because they didn't tend to breathe that well. This engine's had a sensible bit of modernization and upgrading, with the result being that it pulls very strongly, has a good throttle response, and a glorious sound. For a car which is now fifty years old, the brakes on this '67 car are fine for normal everyday driving. There's a set of discs on the front and drums on the rear. It also handles well, in a period style. At the time it was built, they handled much better than early sixties cars because the factories had learned a lot about dynamics.The Ford Mustang redefined American cars. Built from 1964, this was the very first 'pony car', and then everyone started making similar type cars. The Ford Mustang single-handedly created a new class of vehicles, positioning itself as the prototype and benchmark for years to come. The world's very first pony car, characterized by its long hood and short rear deck. Not the most practical of cars, but certainly one of the most stylish. 1967 was the only year for the GTA, which was a Mustang GT with an automatic transmission. The 1967 model year Mustang was the first redesign of the original model. The major mechanical feature was to allow the installation of a big-block V8 engine. The overall size, interior and cargo space were increased. Exterior trim changes included concave taillights, side scoop.

A high-quality resto-mod, this coupe offers comfort, performance, and fantastic good looks that will always be in demand.  ", "  It's obvious where this cool Highland Green coupe got its inspiration, but nevertheless, it chooses to go its own way. There are definitely some Bullitt styling cues, but with the green vinyl top, coupe profile, and blacked-out hood and tail panel, it takes on its own unique look. As one of the most iconic cars ever built, it's always wise to leave the original sheetmetal alone, so the guys who built this car concentrated on making it right instead. Smooth sheetmetal, good gaps, and excellent prep give the paint a great foundation, and as any painter will tell you, it's the prep that makes the finish. Of course, the modern two-stage urethane gives it a depth and gloss that were unimaginable back in 1965, and a final buff makes it shine. It's not perfect, but this car is definitely going to get attention at shows. Most of the original emblems remain in place, although there's a Shelby-style grille that's definitely reminiscent of McQueen's fastback. Chrome bumpers add some nice contrast and we believe that vinyl top is original to the car, so that should tell you just how well-preserved it really is.   ", "  The black interior wears traditional-looking Pony seat covers on a set of custom TMI seats buckets, so it's both old and new at the same time. Original-style door panels work well with the black carpets and dash, giving it a very old school Mustang look that doesn't beat you over the head with the upgrades. The steering wheel is a familiar woodgrained three-spoke design and it still carries the original gauges, although they've been upgraded with white faces and cool blue-white backlighting. A new AM/FM stereo blows away the original AM radio, and there's a subtle under-dash A/C system that's a lot more effective than the original dealer-installed unit. In the trunk you'll find a correct reproduction plaid mat and plenty of room for your gear.  ", "  The interchangeability of the Ford small blocks means that you can shoehorn a few extra cubes under the hood of an early Mustang and nobody will be the wiser. In this case, it's a 302 cubic inch V8, better known as the 5.0, whose performance and reliability are legendary. It's nicely dressed with finned valve covers, the familiar chrome air cleaner, and a few other niceties, but the real goal was making it reliable and fast with an OEM look. In that regard, the new aluminum radiator and electric fans are definitely a help, as is the new dual exhaust system with original-style mufflers exhausting through a GT rear valence. A modern 5-speed manual gearbox feeds an 8-inch rear end, and 4-wheel disc brakes are fitted all around for impressive stopping power. Cool 17-inch MC Classic wheels look very right on a H"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1965 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "", "price": "33995", "kilometers": 145128.582, "total_pages": 46, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/35028675", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "35028675", "year": "1965", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "302 V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "90,198 miles", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Stock #": "3909-ATL", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Green", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Green"}},

find.  Because while the exterior looks like a terrific tribute to a 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, when you look closer, you'll see a custom A/C interior, a modern supercharged V8 power, and a competition-grade fully independent suspension.  So yes, this looks like an iconic classic, but it can literally run circles around the rest.  ", "  When building a tribute car that surpasses the original, you must first make sure that the body outshines them all.  You can see from the included restoration photo book the meticulous care that went into this droptop.  All the important stuff is here, including a fiberglass hood, hood pins, extended nose, quarter panel scoops, and well-integrated trunk lid spoiler.  The wide taillights even have the cool sequential turn signals, and there's a snake-bitten gas cap in the center. The most distinctive feature are the close-set driving lights in the center of the grille, which not all of Shelby's original cars even got in '67.  But there are also some custom features that will let keen minds know that this is something extra special.  For example, the stripe package is distinctive.  And the way it has been clearcoated in with the bright red paint gives this one the butter-smooth appearance that comes from a top-quality investment.  And those wheels look like Mags, but a second look will show that they are custom billet pieces in a larger 17-inch size.  ", "  The investment didn't just stop with the exterior. Just like the outside, the interior has some of the vintage feeling, but it has all the right upgrades.  This starts with new front seats that appear traditional, but are really SCAT Procar Elite units with modern bolstering to keep you better planted during cornering.  In-between these buckets is a custom center console that houses all the added switches.  You get all the right upgrades like power steering, an anti-theft system, and an AM/FM/CD stereo with subwoofers and an aux input for modern music players.  Plus, there's power windows and a power convertible top, so you never have to leave the driver's seat to go from enclosed comfort to a wind-in-your-hair experience.  Thanks to the modern R134a air conditioning, you can show off the cool droptop profile with aggressive roll bar all year long without breaking a sweat.  But more than just looking fast, owing a classic Shelby Mustang is all about the driving experience.  That's why you get the best features like the wood-rimmed steering wheel and snake-bitten GT500 gear knob.  Plus, the full set of Stewart-Warner Performance gauges let your senses know this is a powerful machine even before you twist the key and hear it roar.  ", "  Under the hood is a Mustang legend, but a far more modern one.  Ford's fantastic fuel-injected DOHC 32-valve SVT Mustang Cobra V8 is powering this classic droptop.  And while that's plenty of power for some people, this one makes sure it's the top dog by adding a Vortec V-2E supercharger.  It has been further enhanced with a BBK 62MM throttle body, Griffin Aluminum radiator with Spal fan, and a custom K&N cold air intake.  The full package is estimated to be at 450-500 hp, but that's only part of this custom build's story.  All this power is fully under your control thanks to the Tremec T-45 five-speed manual transmission, and this feeds a Currie 9-inch rear.  And while you're looking over every inch of this build, the undercarriage photos are going to be your favorite part.  That's when you'll see all the best suspension upgrades.  Up front there's a Heidts Mustang II deluxe unit with thick sway bar.  In the rear is a Heidts Superide IRS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, a '67 with a fully independent suspension!

", "  We love a good Mustang in red or black to showcase some sports car prowess, but there's also something nice about going in a more luxurious direction with Springtime Yellow.  It gives this coupe a more premium feeling, and you'll see that there have been all the right investments to back this up.  It starts with a professional respray of the factory-correct color.  The added gloss and shine are the perfect complement to the mirror-like new chrome bumpers, complete trim, and shiny Cragar SS wheels that are as much an iconic as the Mustang.  Plus, the black vinyl roof is a great period-correct premium touch.  ", "  That standout roof is also a great introduction to the interior color.  You can tell there was the right investments in keeping the dash, door panels, headliner, and comfort-weave bucket seats looking dark and fresh.  But this is not a full midnight package.  You've got great brightwork on everything from the newer door handles to the factory center console.  Plus, all your favorite pieces have plenty of shine like the classic sports steering wheel, heat/defrost controls, and the correct round five-gauge full readout panel.  And because this is the perfect cool cruising classic, they made sure you could listen to your favorite tunes on the upgraded Kenwood AM/FM/CD stereo system.  ", "  When you open the hood, you'll see all the right pieces for a great driving classic.  Ford's trusty 289 V8 looks great with serious signs of keeping it reliable.  The clean presentation showcases the MSD ignition as well as fresh belts, wires, and hoses.  Plus, a Griffin aluminum radiator is always a welcomed upgrade.  But as you marvel at the right reliable components, don't forget to also spot the performance upgrades.  This V8 inhales deeply with a four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority through headers that feed the stainless dual exhaust.  This is the kind of car that wants you to feel the road, and this cruising attitude Is heightened by the three-speed automatic transmission and front disc brakes.  So you'll love driving this classic near or far.  ", "  Complete with owner's manual and a restoration photo book, you are looking at an American icon that is distinctive for being both premium and great to drive.  A total package classic at a value price never waits for long, so don't miss out.

The Mach 1 package was only available in the 'SportsRoof' body style (previously known as the 'Fastback'); never on the hardtop or convertible. Many resto-mod visual conversions have since been performed by owners and enthusiasts, but are not Mach 1's by VIN code.  The Mach 1 started with a V8 powered 'Sportsroof' body and added numerous visual and performance enhancing items such as matte black hood treatment with hood pins, hood scoop (including optional Shaker scoop), competition suspension, chrome pop-open gas cap, revised wheels with Goodyear Polyglas tires, chrome exhaust tips (except 351W 2V), deluxe interior, livery and dealer optional chin spoiler, rear deck spoiler, and rear window louvers (SportSlats).  Mach 1s came with upgraded suspension to varying degrees dependent upon powertrain choices. Big block cars had front shock tower reinforcement, thicker sway bars (no rear bar for 69), and heavier springs and shocks. 428 CJ/SCJ 4 speed cars also came with staggered rear shocks. Standard on Mach 1s was a fierce but cosmetic hood scoop that had integrated turn-signal lights mounted in the back. A more functional option was the signature \"Shaker hood\", an air scoop mounted directly to the top of the motor, used to collect fresh air and so named for its tendency to \"shake\" above the rumbling V-8 below. The interior came complete with teak wood grain details, full sound deadening material and high-back sport bucket seats.  Ford kept the Mach 1 alive into 1970 and little changed other than the visuals. The 1970 body included dual-beam headlights with the previous inner headlights becoming sport lamps and recessed taillights on a black honeycomb rear panel, side scoops behind both doors removed, revised bucket seats, deep dish sports wheel covers, as well as new side and rear badging and striping were the main visual differences. 1970 saw the previous 351W V8 engine options replaced with a new 351 cu in (5.8 L) Cleveland (351C) V8 in either 2V (for use with 2-venturi carbs) or 4V (for use with 4-venturi carbs) versions. The 351C 4V (M code) engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300 bhp (224 kW; 304 PS) at 5400 rpm. This new performance engine incorporated elements learned from the Ford 385 series engine and the Boss 302, particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves and the thin-wall casting technology.
