Only 732 yellow Corvette convertibles were sold in 1986 but what makes this drop-top stand apart is that it is one of the five actual pace cars involved with the race at the famed Brickyard. Serving as a backup track car this Corvette was used in festivals and special events surrounding the big race. Accompanying the Corvette is a treasure trove of factory and race-day documentation that include items like the original window sticker, a Chevrolet poster signed by all 33 Indy 500 drivers, a commemorative Indy 500 license plate (75) signed by race winner Bobby Rahal as well as a newspaper picture of pace car driver General Chuck Yeager in this actual car! This all-original Corvette also received the most prestigious award available from worldwide-recognized Bloomington Gold Corvettes by adorning the convertible with its Gold Certified Certificate. This special Corvette even spent time on display at the Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky! Over the years pace cars have typically been modified for on-track duties, but the Corvette's track-ready suspension and available 350 CI/230 HP fuel injected small block made upgrades unnecessary. Nonetheless, rather than being just a track car, it is exceptionally well-equipped with power leather bucket seats, digital instrumentation, air conditioning, cruise control, power windows and AM/FM stereo to name a few. Complete with a custom dash plaque and the original graphics this historically significant 1986 Corvette convertible pace car has been driven a mere 12K miles since new and is presented in exceptional physical and mechanical condition. Power is courtesy of the aluminum cylinder head L98 5.7-liter V8 that produces 230 horsepower and is mated to a 4-speed overdrive transmission. The Corvette rolls on its original P255/VR5016 Goodyear tires (Hendrick Performance will offer a new set of comparable replacement tires if desired by the new owner) mounted to the bright brushed finish aluminum wheels. Given the historical significance, great condition and the high level of documentation, this Corvette is sure to be the centerpiece of any collection for years to come!

A comfy cloth bench seats with textured inserts, full carpeting, power windows, power locks, cruise control, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo all look original.  And because they're all working nicely, this classic gives you the comfort of a modern pickup.  But that sliding rear window provides an old-school breeze like no new truck can.  Since the factory air conditioning is still blowing cold, feel free to open it up any time of year.", "Under the hood is Chevy's reliable 305 cubic-inch small block.  This is believed to be the original V8 to the truck, and it certainly looks the part with all the right components in place and looking tidy.  It fires up nicely, and the four-barrel carburetor makes job-ready power.  Plus, you might have noticed the dual fuel tanks \u2013 another great option for those who love useful classics.  Add in power steering, power brakes, and the three-speed automatic transmission, and this Silverado is a great all-around cruiser.", "Affordable, useful, and eye-catching, this is a terrific vintage truck offered for a terrific price.

A true survivor, this unrestored 1988 Suburban shows a little over 40K miles on the odometer and has most certainly been pampered throughout its life and it shows. Believed to be garage-kept through its ownership, the paint looks terrific and all the glass is in great condition. On the cavernous interior is mint condition cloth upholstery with a bench front seat and a 60/40 split rear. This two-wheel-drive Suburban is powered by the proven Chevrolet 5.7 liter 350 cubic-inch V8 engine producing 195 horsepower and 300-foot pounds torque. It is equipped with a 4-speed automatic-over-drive transmission, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo cassette and factory aluminum wheels with Goodyear Wrangler tires to name a few. Faithfully serviced from new the Suburban needed very little when it was inspected by our Hendrick Performance technicians. An engine oil and filter change, preventative brake system flush along with the installation of a new muffler and tail pipe were just recently performed. Included with this incredible survivor SUV are the original owner's manuals as well as several service receipts. Don't miss your chance to own a fantastic Suburban in tremendous original condition!
