Today we'd call it a \u00c2\u00be-ton, and despite a similar appearance to the 3100 series, real truck people will always respect the extra rarity of this workhorse.  ", "  This truck offers just the right combination of utility, beauty, and functionality. Sure, some of these are over-restored into trailer queens, but this one's blue-collar roots run too deep. So instead, it has industrial attractiveness in its handsome white grille and bumpers that match the wheels.  There is some extra flair to the more modern application of red paint, but it's also hard to resist showing off the handsome rounded sheetmetal of the Task Force pickup with stepside bed.  It's the kind of presentation that adds charm without going overboard.  The same can be said about the new rubber on the bed rails protecting the real wood truck bed.  This dedication to keeping this polished workhorse looking so authentic pays off every time you take it to the car show and someone spots the bright 3600 badges on the hood sides and says, I thought they only made these in 3100 series.  ", "  The interior is still working-class all the way, but that's all part of the vintage truck appeal. The bench seat has been given a durable but comfortable cloth cover.  Pickups from the 1950s didn't come adorned with a long feature list, and that actually adds to this 3600's charm.  You get to connect to a bygone era every time you gaze at the classic fan-style speedometer, and ahead of that is the factory-style wheel that still has the grooves from the workman who gripped it before you.  Those are the kinds of things you think about from this truck's big airy and open cabin.   ", "  Under the hood is a 235 cubic-inch inline six. This is a period-correct powerplant, so we suspect it could be original to the pickup.  And speaking of authenticity, you can really tell there was some nice time and investment detailing the engine bay with its full blue presentation.  You can still expect an honest day's work out of this 3600 thanks to the motor's level of workman torque.  So even if you're just out for a pleasurable drive, there's always plenty of power.   For that added touch of period-correct and industrial-sized fun, the motor is mated to a four-speed floor shift manual transmission.  It was optional for heavier duty machines versus the typical three on the tree. One helpful piece of new equipment is the set of modern radial tires. It offers more modern grip and adds real comfort to your Sunday drives.  ", "  You're looking at a rare and interesting 3600 Chevy with the power and poise to still be a workhorse.  So if you're a lover of distinct classics, this is that perfect industrial-sized prize at a very nice price.

"description": ["This first series 1955 Chevrolet 3100 is the final year of the iconic Advanced Design, making it one of the rarest around.  But you really are just going to love it because the terrific old-school presentation inside & out feels like a time machine.  ", "  This truck is truly rolling history at its finest.  1955 was the final year for the Advance Design trucks that got America moving again after WWII.  This pickup really symbolizes the attitude that jump started us back into peacetime.  With the wood rails on the wood truck bed makes it looks like it could still go to work today.  But take a closer look.  The extra gloss of the lumber matches nicely with the extra luster of the more modern application of the yellow and tan paint.  And if it's shine you like, the bumpers and two-piece wheels really add to this bright presentation.  Plus, the way the panels fit on this pickup, let you know someone took the time in restoration to erase its workman past without erasing its historic appearance.  It's the perfect balance of period-correct and premium.  ", "  The interior is still working-class all the way, but that's all part of the vintage truck appeal. The vinyl bench seat shows virtually no wear, and the same can be said for the door panels and rubber flooring.  Pickups from the 1950s didn't come adorned with a long feature list, and that actually adds to this 3100's charm.  This is part of an era where its heater was a valued option because it gave you a chance to warm up on your way home from working the day in the outdoors.  Those are the kinds of things you think about from this truck's big airy and open cabin.  You get to connect to a bygone era every time you grab the three-spoke steering wheel, rest your hand on the tall gearstick, and gaze at the large original gauge package.    ", "  Under the hood is a 261 cubic-inch inline six. It's an upgrade in displacement over what was available in the 3100 for '55 without losing the iconic Job Master/Stovebolt attitude.  In fact, we know you'll love showing off all the details, from the long blue motor, to the silver oil bath air cleaner, to all the correct markings.  While this is not an all-out speed machine, the four-speed manual transmission ensures you are in complete control of the powerband.  Besides, you don't buy a truck like this for all-out performance.  Sure, a small block fits easily in the engine bay, but your largest enjoyment is watching others see you ride around town in this alluring package.  And right now you get to do that with an intoxicating rhythmic chug that comes from true vintage truck motoring.  ", "  The Advance Design trucks were only in production for less than half of '55 before their successor started coming down the line.  So a rare First Series pickup from 1955 always is a great distinction to have.  And so when you look at the rarity, terrific presentation, and affordable price, you realize you need to hurry to grab this deal.

We will describe the truck inside and out.\u00c2\u00a0A beautiful deep dark purple color with lots of pearl. The paint is so deep that you can see your reflection in it. The truck is painted inside and out. The inside of the cab, doors, jambs, dash and interior are all the same dark purple. The inside of the bed is painted to match. The exhaust on the truck looks great it is custom as well. The exhaust comes out just above the rear bumper and towards the back. The bed is custom as well. The chrome strips accent and highlight the depth in the wood. The wood in the bed is an exotic wood known as Purple Heart. The wood is custom cut and finished to put into the truck.The interior of the truck as been finished in grey and black highlights. The seat is new along with the rest of the interior. The dash looks great as well as the custom gauges. The glass is all new. The door glass has been converted to a one piece glass with a nice kit from the Truck Shop. The truck does not have a heater or ac. crate motor 400 along with an automatic 400 transmission. The motor and transmission run and sound great. The motor puts down enough power to light the tires up and it still runs very cool. The aluminum four core radiator ensure that the truck runs nice and cool. The front end is off a Chevy Camaro and the rear-end is a Chevy rear end with 3.73 posi-traction rear-end. The lug bolt pattern is all the same around the truck (5 x 4 3/4). The battery is relocated to the bottom of the bed. Also the disc brake booster has been relocated.

This is a rare body style being a 1955 in the \"Advance Design\" style which proceeded the \"Task Force\" style which debuted in 1955.  The Advance Design trucks were the last of the trucks with the round bubble hood shape which we've grown to love.  This particular truck is the classic step side bed with side mounted spare tire.  She's finished in bright red which looks great.  Under the hood the engine has been upgraded to a 350 CID V8 crate engine.  This is a fresh engine with only 1,500 miles on it.  The small block mounts up to an automatic transmission for easy cruising.  Though the engine is fresh, it was a low mileage vehicle to begin with, believed to have only 63,000 original miles.  Without a doubt this is a special truck with a great look.  This is a great truck for the Chevrolet enthusiast or just someone looking to get into the hobby.  Classic trucks of this vintage are climbing in popularity and value.  You can see this very cool 1955 Chevrolet 3100 pickup in greater detail in our St. Louis showroom or at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.
