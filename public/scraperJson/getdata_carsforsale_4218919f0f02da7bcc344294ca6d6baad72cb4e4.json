So when this 1969 Cadillac Eldorado is also so affordable, it's time to take notice.  ", "  The design lines of the sixth generation Eldorado are ones of legend.  It's a true statement of personal luxury with flowing details.  The extra long hood starts with a sharp middle point and  begins a crease line that runs uninterrupted to the doors and emphasizes the sporty kick-up on the rear quarter panels.  And the super-slick rear end was there to let you know the excess of the tailfin era was over, but this Cadillac still knew how to pay homage to its history.  Also, while you're checking out the rear, take a look at the bumper.  That chrome king is integrated into the design better than you can even get on a modern Cadillac.  And if its brightwork you like, the front bumper shines just as brilliantly.  You can see all of these details so well because of the level of care that has gone into this Caddy.  The sheetmetal looks amazing, and the doors still shut with authority.  And on top of this straight body is the original shade of Astral Blue that has the kind of gloss to highlight every crease so this Eldorado looks like a finely pressed suit.  The pristine blue vinyl top not only gives this coupe a very European color scheme, but also it gives you a preview of the interior.  ", "  Inside, you'll love how everything from the wood paneling on the door to the plushness of the carpets have defied the decades.  The driver's seat has been worn in a bit, but quite frankly, you probably wish you were this complete as you approach nearly half a century on this earth.  Plus, you get the kind of luxury that made these Cadillacs so special in 1969, and the kind of options that you would expect in a brand new car today.  This includes power seats, power windows, power locks, tilt steering wheel, rear defogger, the original AM/FM stereo, and provisions for automatic climate control. You sit behind the original Caddy three-spoke steering wheel and gaze at a clear gauge package.  And all the controls are centered around you, because this is built to be a personal luxury machine.  But on those days when you want to share the comfort with family and friends, the flat floor of the Eldorado means it really does offer relaxed seating for up to six total.  ", "  The 472 cubic-inch V8 fills the engine bay, because this was the era when Cadillac was a true master at offering big motors with big power.  And more than just being the original numbers-matching V8, you can really tell there has been proper care and maintenance over the years thanks to items like the fresh hoses and belts.  Plus, there has been a great eye to preservation as noted by all the factory decals still present under the hood.

After being stored for 25 years, this beauty was resurrected. In 2011 it was fully serviced, painted, new top, new tires, battery, and more. Driving this land yacht with the top down is surely a great way to clear your mind or take a memorable cruise to see the sights. It drives nearly like it did new, it's amazing! Under the hood is a 472 CID V8 engine backed by a smooth shifting automatic transmission. This Caddy is fully loaded with character as well as options. options include: AC, AM/FM radio, automatic convertible top, cruise control, hub caps, power brakes, power steering, power seats, power windows, tilt wheel, seat belts, leather interior, and white wall radial tires. In 1969 DeVille was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like front fender treatment evolved and helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step-down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. The looks of this Caddy are as strong as the 472 V8 powering it forward. Drop the top and enjoy the sun on your shoulders. If you get hot, flip the AC on high.

After all, it was the only year for the big 500ci V8 in the 6th generation Eldorado.  Plus, this one is presented so nicely with a super shine on the outside and comfortable A/C in the original leather interior.  So when a premium cruising coupe is at such a value price, it might not be here long enough for you to read all the details.  ", "  The design lines of this generation Eldorado are ones of legend.  It's a true statement of personal luxury with the extra long hood that begins a crease line that runs uninterrupted through the doors, until it reaches the sporty rear kick-up.  And the super-slick rear end was there to let you know the excess of the tailfin era was over -- but this Cadillac still knew how to pay homage to its history.  While you're checking out the rear, take a look at the bumper.  That chrome king is integrated into the design better than you can even get on a modern Cadillac.  And if its brightwork you like, the front bumper shines just as brilliantly.  You can see all of these details so well because of the level of care that has gone into this Caddy.  The sheetmetal looks amazing, and the doors still shut with authority.  And on top of this straight body is a more modern shade of dark red that has the kind of gloss to highlight every crease so this Eldorado looks like a finely pressed suit.  The original brown vinyl top is a premium touch that coordinates nicely with the new red, and it even gives you a preview of the interior.  ", "  Inside, you'll be amazed at the level of preservation in the original brown leather interior.  Everything from the wood paneling on the door panels to the plushness of the carpets have defied the decades.  The driver's seat has been worn in a bit, but quite frankly, you probably wish you were this complete as you approach nearly half a century on this earth.  Plus, you get the kind of luxury that made these Cadillacs so special in 1970, and the kind of options that you would expect in a brand new car today.  This includes power seats, power windows, power locks, tilt steering wheel, and the original AM/FM stereo. You sit behind the original Caddy three-spoke steering wheel and gaze at a clear gauge package.  But it's not just comfortable for you.  The flat floor of the Eldorado means it really does offer relaxed seating for six.  And no matted how many family or friends are along for the ride, you're going to love being able to roll down all the windows with the touch of a button, and still remain cool thanks to the upgrade to R134a air conditioning.  ", "  1970 was the first year for the monstrous 500 cubic-inch V8 motor. And since the generation changed in '71, this makes for a unique and very desirable powerplant in this car.

The Black Pearl Metallic paint is brand new and honestly looks better than the original coat of paint would have.\u00c2\u00a0The car is a solid car, and with the low miles you don't have to worry about any rust whatsoever, just see how clean all of the door jambs look! All of the plastic end caps and bumper fillers are in excellent, crack-free, brand new condition and were all replaced when the car was painted. The exterior of the car overall is absolutely immaculate and looks absolutely as good as the day it rolled off the lot. The hubcaps really finish off the look of this jewel.

Firethorn metallic is a lovely color. While it\u2019s considered red, it\u2019s really much more of a coral. Paint is original, as confirmed with an elcometer, and has a great metallic sparkle to it under direct light. The paint shows very well. There are a handful of small chips scattered about the car, with by far the most significant chipping being on the driver\u2019s side of the trunk lid (see photo). White pinstripes are without cracks or wear, and contrast extremely well against the metallic coral paint. Chrome is excellent throughout, and really completes the look of this big sedan. There is no oxidation or damage on the chrome at all; it shines nice and bright with a mirror-like finish. Landau hardtop is in pristine condition, with absolutely no scratches, scrapes, or damage. There are a few small door-dings on the car, with two light dings on the trunk lid and another on the passenger rear quarter. There is some minor bubbling beginning to form under the paint at the lowest points of the rear skirts (see photos). All doors close without any fuss. Glass is clear and crack and scratch-free throughout.", "Interior:", "The interior of the car presents extremely well. Phenomenally comfortable Firethorn cloth seats with leather bolsters are in great shape, with no tears or stains. Seats are powered, as are windows and mirrors. Carpets are also stain and tear free both front and rear. The car will come with its original Firethorn floormats, which are in nice shape. Headliner is tight. All powered systems are functional \u2013 dash lights, cruise control, heat, seat adjustments, radio, and gauges. Air conditioning blows, but is on R12 refrigerant and is not cold. All lights are functional both inside and out. Odometer is functional and currently reads 65,680 miles.", "Under the Hood / Underbody:", "This Sedan deVille retains its original 500cid 8.2L V8. The car runs and drives very, very well. Starts right up without fault, idles cool and steady, and tracks nice and straight down the road. Brakes feel very good, with no hooking in either direction.
