But to properly own this icon, you need to standout just a little bit.  That's why this one has a sportier attitude that you instantly see from any angle.  Up front it's the addition of the hood pins and hood scoop; the sides have upgraded Mag wheels; and the rear has the dual exhaust coming out of the valance like a cool GT machine.  But even with these upgrades, all your favorite pieces are still in place. There's the correct grille with the running pony emblem, 289 badges on the fenders, and the three-element taillights.

We really like the presentation of the bucket seat interior that look like the door panels and carpeting have received recent attention.  This is a great place to experience vintage driving thanks to the classic three-spoke sports steering wheel with Mustang center cap, and the center console with T-bar gear shift for the three-speed automatic transmission.  And while this looks factory-correct, right down to the trunk mat and a full-sized spare tire, there are some nice upgrades.  For example, the retro-style AM/FM stereo has a digital tuner and an input for modern music players.  And the upgrade to white faces on the round gauge package adds to the clarity and sportiness.", "The 289 cubic-inch V8 looks like it has received the right attention and investments.  It's nicely dressed with its bold blue block, shiny valve covers, and Monte Carlo bar across the top.  Plus, this one is upgraded for power with the hood scoop feeding the performance air element, Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and Edelbrock intake.  That means an extra kick of V8 power going down the road and an enhanced rumble from the dual exhaust.", "A red '66 Mustang convertible is always in demand, so when it's priced so right, you know you need to hurry to grab this deal.

The restoration work included: 289 V8 2 barrel motor rebuilt, 14\" GT Rally Wheels new black vinyl interior. The undercarriage was sandblated, primed and painted. At the time the car was resprayed with DuPont 2 stage base Vivid Black paint and 4 coats clear. The body and engine work was done by Rolf Schley and Paul's Auto Body of Fitchburg, MA, with Mustang parts supplied by Mustangs Unlimited of Manchester, CT. Later in 2011 32,000 miles with the driveline was upgraded with a '66 270HP K engine, 4 speed transmission, and 9\" rear end. Engine updated by Carrol Shelby Factory Ford update kit in 1967 (306 HP).", "One option in the Mustang was the high performance 271-hp \"K-code\" 289. From a recent article in Hemmings: \"Technically, the \"Hi-Po\" 289 wasn't even available in the Mustang until June, 1964, a full two months after Mustang's launch, which then knocked the 210-hp D-code 289 down a peg as top engine option. When it became available, however, the lively K-code engine only served to further solidify Mustang's capabilities as a legitimate performance machine during an era when Ford's dominance in auto racing could be seen in just about every discipline of the sport.", "Ford's own advertising of the K-code was a direct call to \"...those who will settle for nothing less than top performance...\" The company provocatively laid out its case for the engine, stating: \"Designed especially for the true sports enthusiast, this powerful V-8 provides sports car performance to match Mustang's sports car styling. Buyers intending to enter competitive events, such as gymkhanas or rallies, will appreciate this engine's breathtaking acceleration, over 600 feet in the first 10 seconds from a standing start.\" Included with the \"Hi-Po\" 289 were a Special Handling Package and a full complement of 6.95 x 14 dual-red-stripe tires. The entry fee for this performance boost: a whopping $442.60 over the additional $75 assigned to the 260-cu in engine option. With the exception of the $283.20 air conditioning, no other factory or dealer Mustang accessory had such an impact on buyer's wallets, which means K-code production was understandably low. Over the course of a three model-year run (technically all 19641/2; Mustangs have a '65 model year VIN), just 13,231 of the nearly 1.7 million Mustangs that rolled from the assembly line were equipped as such: 7,273 from introduction through '65.", "Here are some more details behind the inner workings of the K-code Mustangs. \"The solid-lifter K-code 289 was not your average Ford small-block. Inside the over-square short-block's four-inch cylinder bores were high-strength flat-top aluminum pistons, which were linked via heavy-duty connecting rods with larger 3/8-inch rod bolts to a higher-nodular cast-iron crankshaft featuring a larger front counterweight to maintain high-RPM balance. Holding the crankshaft in place were heavy-duty two-bolt main bearing caps. Each cylinder head was equipped with 1.78/1.45-inch intake/exhaust valves and screw-in rocker arm studs, while cast-iron header-type exhaust manifolds helped breathing. Perched atop the cast-iron intake manifold was an Autolite 4100 four-barrel carburetor touting a 600-CFM flow rate, capped by an open-element air cleaner assembly with a chromed lid and appropriate engine callout decals; the rocker-arm covers were also finished in chrome. A dual-point distributor rounded out the build, along with a dual exhaust system featuring an H-pipe, single transverse muffler and twin tailpipes.", "With a 10.5:1 compression ratio, all told the engine was rated for a stout 271 hp at 6,000 RPM and 312 lb ft of torque at 3,400 RPM. Weighing just 465 pounds, the Hi-Po 289 made for an excellent power-to-weight ratio in the Mustang. Generally considered a very durable engine, there were only a few running changes made to this 289 and its related operating systems, beginning with a switch to dual mufflers during the full-1965 model year production run. Ford also converted to an alternator-based charging system for the full-1965 model year, as well as to a six-bolt bell housing pattern to provide space for an 11-inch clutch. No upgrades were made in 1966. The K-code was ultimately overshadowed by the 320-hp S-code 390 in '67, which explains its rapid drop in production figures that year.", "ABOUT MOTORLAND", "For sale or trade.
