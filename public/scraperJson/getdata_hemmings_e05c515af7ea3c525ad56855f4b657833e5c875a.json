Over the past 60 years, these cars have remained highly-collectible, and the ''57 Bel Air isthe most sought-after of all. This 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air hardtop is a great car for the hardcore collector looking to take it to the next level or the casual enthusiast looking for a really fun daily driver.", "The classic body design of this legendary automobile is timeless. It's still as attractive now as it was back then. The Sport Coupe is, of course, the two-door hardtop version of the 1957 Bel Air and arguably the most-coveted ''shoebox'' to roll off the showroom. As you survey the craftsmanship of days gone by, you'll be thoroughly impressed when you see just how solid the body is on this vehicle. Granted, you may see a scratch here or imperfection there; minor wear and tear from six decades of enjoyment. But you will be more than a little relieved to see that there are no major rust issues, no noticeable dents, and the doors open and close very well. The bumpers and side trim are all in decent condition, as is the ornamental chrome. And those fins! Has there ever been a more recognizable feature on any car than the fins of a '57 Chevy? It shines well, but there are a few small areas where it is starting to lose a little luster. Adding to the overall beauty of the car is a nice set of B.F. Goodrich radials mounted on custom wheels.", "The spacious '57 Bel Air interior is home to a set of black and gray bucket seats front and rear. It's a color combination that looks good against the red exterior paint job. Of course, there's plenty of room for the whole family. So load 'em up, turn up the volume on the AM/FM radio, and let's go cruising. A chrome B&M shifter allows efficient gear selection, while a three-gauge instrument cluster hangs beneath the dash. Other than that, the interior has retained a relatively stock appearance. All of the interior is presentable, and although not perfect like the outside, you'd consider the overall condition as driver quality.", "Fire this baby up and you can tell by the deep, throaty growl that there is some serious horsepower being made under the hood. The motor in this street classic is a whopping 454 cubic inch Big Block Chevy bored .030 over. Rest assured, this engine has all sorts of goodies inside and out. A Holley carburetor and aluminum intake feed fuel to a power plant equipped with a moderate solid lift cam and a new set of World Products heads, rocker arm stud girdles and dyno-tuned headers. Put the pedal to the metal and see how this Bad Bel Air accelerates. This is one of those monstrous motors that just bellows across the countryside when you open it up.  The iconic TH 400 is the transmission of choice, funneling a ton of brute horsepower back to the 10-bolt Chevrolet rear-end. A look underneath reveals a clean chassis with all the suspension parts in good condition. Everything under there is mostly stock except for the addition of power steering and power disc brakes up front to add to a pleasurable driving experience.", "This 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air is a really neat car that could play well to a broad audience. Here we have one of those cars that can be thoroughly enjoyed just as it sits. On the other hand, you can invest a little time and money and end up with a showpiece. Either way, you can't go wrong with this automobile. Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Red", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "10280"}},

Our recent sales success with pickups just like this 1987 Chevrolet Silverado says they are, and most of them weren't even this nice. With a great color combination, a huge list of options, and utility you can actually use, this is a great way to get V8 power and rear-wheel-drive in an affordable package.", "Wearing a repaint in its original bright red, this high-visibility Silverado was obviously not some contractor's work truck. It was built at the dawn of our motoring obsession with giant trucks and was probably one of the early examples of using a full-sized pickup as a daily driver. As a result, it has straight bodywork and probably never did more work than helping a buddy move on a Saturday afternoon. There is no evidence of major bodywork and after spending its life in the dry southern US, it's obviously not a rust bucket. The paint shines up well with that soft gloss that could pass for factory enamel and there are plenty of signs that it has been regularly washed and waxed with care. Shiny chrome bumpers, matching oversized side mirrors, and upscale Silverado trim make this look far more substantial than its price tag would suggest. And just one glance in the bed will prove that this truck has had a very easy life, as there are barely any marks that would indicate it's ever done serious hauling.", "The familiar dark red cloth upholstery was a GM favorite in the late-80s, and it looks exceptionally good inside the bright red pickup cab. It's mostly original, so it has held up very well with only light signs of wear on the driver's side of the bench seat. Carpets, door panels, and the dash pad are all vintage 1987 and holding up equally well. The argument that this was a daily driver and not a work truck comes from the long list of options, including power windows and locks, factory A/C, cruise control, a tilt column, and an AM/FM stereo in the dash. The A/C system works like it should, the power window and lock mechanisms snap to attention, and lots of little detail items have been serviced in the not-too-distant past, so it all works properly. Matching carpeted floor mats add a luxurious touch and help keep everything looking sharp.", "The engine is a familiar Chevrolet 350 cubic inch V8, which was borrowed from a full-sized Blazer with just 35,000 miles on the clock. Despite the swap it's quite stock under the hood, including the throttle-body fuel injection system which means its starts easily, idles properly, and runs superbly. There's Chevy Orange paint in there that probably isn't how it was originally but it sure looks good, and things like the A/C compressor and drier are recent. It's backed by a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, which combined with dual gas tanks, gives this truck bladder-bursting range on the highway. A fresh Flowmaster dual exhaust system sounds great and the undercarriage is shockingly clean for a pickup of this vintage.

On the other hand, if you want a car built for combat with the hardware to handle some massive horsepower and the ability to dish out some serious beatings, well, this sinister gray ragtop is a fantastic choice.", "Cobra Mustangs were always something special, and they pulled out all the stops when this car was built. That tall cowl-induction hood is an easy tipoff that something unique is going on under the hood, an impression backed up by the giant meats out back, roll bar behind the front seats, and threatening exhaust note. As the flagship of the entire Ford lineup, the Cobra needed to be more special-looking, so they added a different front air dam, a somewhat subtle wing out back, and a few badges, all of which are more or less intact on this car. With just one owner and only 20,834 actual miles, it's in great shape overall and you can tell that it was not intended to be a daily driver, but a weekend toy. The chin spoiler isn't scraped, the rockers haven't been blasted by the tires, and the headlights remain crystal clear. Looking for a unique Cobra? This one is pretty darned nice, especially if you're a horsepower junkie.", "With the Cobra, even the interior gets in on the act. The standard Cobra buckets are supportive and comfortable, but in this car they also featured light gray inserts that closely match the bodywork. Similar leather adorns the door panels and the back seat, and it really ties the whole car together. Then there's the cage that reinforces the tub and adds some safety to the open-top warrior, but it's tucked out of the way and it's really intrusive. 5-point harnesses are probably a good idea, too. Original gauges with white faces are supplemented by a full array of supporting dials to monitor the big boost engine, including an exhaust gas temperature gauges, a boost gauge, and a giant tach with shift light. Cobras were loaded with every accessory Ford could install, so there were no options, but things like power windows and locks and A/C were included and they all still work in this car. Of course, the original 6-speed shifter is gone, replaced by a trick pistol-grip automatic setup, but we'll get to that in a moment. There's an upscale-feeling black canvas convertible top (power-actuated, of course) and it folds so flush with the bodywork as to almost disappear. There's also a decent trunk out back that makes this car seem very civilized indeed.", "While early complaints from Cobra owners focused on their cars not being different enough from a garden-variety pony, that's certainly not the case with this nasty ragtop. The factory 32-valve V8 was fitted with a Stage 3 ported Eaton supercharger by Stiegemeier, which was painted to match the bodywork and fitted with a smaller pulley for more boost. To support it, there's a set of 60 pound injectors, an Accufab throttle body and plenum, upgraded belt tensioner, and a custom flash in the ECM by RPM of Georgia. It's channeled through a built 4R70W automatic transmission built to handle over 1200 horsepower and fitted with a manual valve body and electric overdrive to give the driver maximum control. Ceramic-coated long-tube headers feed a Flowmaster dual exhaust system with X-pipe, and there's a reinforced 8.8-inch rear end out back full of 4.10 gears. Massive brakes were part of the Cobra package and the entire suspension was revamped to help plant the power and keep it pointed in the right direction.

In 1931, this Model A Victoria was affordable transportation and made its owner look and feel like a million bucks (particularly important during the Depression). Today, it does much the same thing, with elegant styling that looks like it should cost thousands more than it does.", "The restoration is now several years old, but it was done quite correctly. Chicle and Copra Drab was a popular choice on the Ford color chart and with contrasting black fenders, moldings, and splash aprons, it looks simply fantastic. Someone spent a lot more than the asking price getting it into this condition and it shows; the paint is glossy, the doors fit well, and aside from some minor checking due to age, it has held up extremely well. The Victoria was a late addition to the lineup and came in two styles, the ''leatherback'' and the steel version seen here, both of which were regarded as the top-of-the-line. Relative to a lot of other Model As, the Victoria is rather rare, and it offers the utility of a sedan with a bit more style. The rear-mounted tire is joined by an accessory trunk rack that allows the installation of a rear-mounted trunk, which enhances this Model A's touring capabilities. A straw-colored pinstripe highlights the subtle curves of the bodywork without looking gratuitous and the long-grain vinyl top insert is correct and nicely installed. Other accessories include the Boyce moto-meter on the radiator and a mesh grille guard.", "The Victoria got lots of upgrades inside, where it feels as luxurious as its big brothers over at Lincoln. Correct broadcloth upholstery, an adjustable front seat, and woodgrained moldings all contribute to the upscale look and feel. Materials and patterns are correct, and this is a comfortable cruiser for four passengers. The standard Model A instrument panel is a late-31 piece with round speedometer and the dash has been properly pinstriped to highlight its shape. The hard rubber steering wheel with center-mounted horn and headlight controls makes you feel like you're at the wheel of something significant, and aftermarket turn signals were added for touring safety. Proper carpets with heel pad for the driver were installed over the original-style wooden floorboards, and thanks to restored weather seals, it closes up tightly and feels hushed inside. Can you believe that a car this nice costs so little?", "The little Ford inline-four makes big torque and moves the relatively lightweight sedan with ease. 45 MPH cruising is not unusual for these cars, and their reliability and fun-to-drive quotient are legendary. How else do you explain that there are still millions on the road today? While many have been haphazardly restored and feel ancient from behind the wheel, this one is tight and confident, with good brakes (as good as Model A brakes get, anyway), and after you master the art of the double-clutch, shifting is fun and easy. The engine bay was obviously detailed at the time of restoration but has been driven quite a bit since then, making this a tour car, not a show car, but that's where Model As really shine. The only notable alteration from stock is a 6-volt alternator, but it's done right and doesn't call attention to itself. It's much the same underneath: clean and functional with signs of a lot of restoration work in the past. The original 19-inch wheels are fitted with accessory trim rings as well as a set of proper blackwall tires that suit the humble Model A just fine.", "Who doesn't love Model As?
