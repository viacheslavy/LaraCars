We still have 10 big boxes full of new parts that go with the car.As you can see, the car was painted in a high gloss plum within the last 2 years. The old owner decided he wanted to straighten out the drivers side door and started block sanding, he then primed the door as well as other parts.The value of this car should be based on others like it that have sold. That puts it up around $55k if it were painted, and the interior installed.  Blue Book for an old car like this would be around $28k. We will sell the car, as is, running and driving for $25k. If your interested in us finishing the car, with us installing all of the interior and painting it, please call Jim at 206-406-1313.As a note, this car comes with a Bill of Sale only. It was originally purchased in a non-title state (Georgia) and sold as a project car. Because the owner never had a chance to finish his restoration, he never registered it as a driving car.

Jim's Personal GuaranteeIf your on our website looking at our classic cars for sale, you're halfway there to buying a true classic. We sell cars with lots of history to consumers interested in prolonging the history of a car that, well, most likely shouldn't even be on the road considering it's age. Each car we have for sale is described in great detail, and in most cases we've taken over 100 photos. We're not interested in forcing a purchase on you for the sake of a sale. We're interested in selling you a car that will bring you happiness for years to come.If the description reads excellent shape or drives really good that means it does exactly what we say it does. We draft a description and take pictures of all the defects and bad parts of the car just as much as the good parts.I'm willing to put my money on the table in order to help you feel more comfortable. If you see JIM'S PERSONAL GUARANTEE anywhere in the description, this means we are prepared to back up the condition. Since 99.5% of all our cars are sold outside the State of Washington, the majority of our buyers are unable to come look at the cars personally. I'd like to make it a little easier for those of you that really want to; but don't want to get here to find that the car is exactly the opposite of what you are looking for.Now you can feel confident that if you fly here from anywhere in the world, and find that the car is not in the condition we have stated it is in, and that we have overstated its condition, we will pay for your R/T airfare and one nights stay at the Inn at Gig Harbor just up the street.The Inn at Gig Harbor is 1/2 a block away from our shop.

The wood is in remarkable condition. The wheels and spokes are almost brand new. The engine runs great and she is ready for a new owner.This vehicle is the heavy duty truck version of the Model T called the Model TT. Introduced in 197 , the Model TT was the only major variant of the Model T. TT's have a longer and stronger chassis and lower gear ratios to enable the standard Model T 20hp engine to move one ton of freight. This vehicle also has a factory made cab. Prior to 1924, Ford only sold a rolling chassis. It was left to local manufacturers to build the cabs and beds, which is why there is such a variety of different styles to be seen on remaining examples. This vehicle also features one of the very few Ford approved aftermarket adaptations, a Ruckstell underdrive which made it easier for the vehicle to haul heavy loads over very poor roads and up hills. It allowed a top speed of 22 MPH. A regular TT only made 17 MPH while standard cars and runabouts, the light duty truck we now know as pick-ups, could zoom along at 35MPH. As mentioned, the TT has a longer wheelbase than the regular T, 125 inches compared with 100."]}},

The paint, which was recently applied and the car's trim are in overall show-quality condition. The body was removed and the underbody was refinished in iron oxide. New nuts and bolts were used throughout. With new suspension, exhaust and new brake components, front and rear, the driveshaft, transmission and more are all in new or rebuilt condition.", "The left and right wing windows are inoperable but overall, the car's glass panels are in fine shape, including the plastic rear window. This bird's lights are also in very condition, clear and crack-free. The car rolls on redline and whitewall tires, size 215/75R15, surrounding Kelsey-Hayes style wire wheels and all are in splendid, newer condition. The car's body panels are straight and solid, including the new, white power-folding top.

The red metal instrument panel, two-spoke steering wheel (Swing-Away; see next paragraph), door panel, mirror glass and center console are all in very good condition. The shift lever is in good shape and the car includes its factory AM radio.", "The Swing-Away Steering Wheel was a new option introduced on the 1961 Ford Thunderbird. Priced at $25.10, it was a special steering column that moved to the right about 10.5 inches to allow for easier entry and exit for the driver, especially with a purse, briefcase, or packages in tow. On this design, the steering column itself moved and a special metal plate on the instrument panel to the right of the steering column filled the gap when the steering wheel was in the normal drive position and a color-keyed vinyl panel filled the gap on the left side of the column when it had been moved aside.", "The car could be started with the steering wheel in either position, but for safety's sake, the transmission could not be shifted out of park until the column had been moved back to normal driving position. And for the same reason, the steering wheel was securely locked in place for driving except for when the transmission shifter was in park.", "Despite its popularity on the Thunderbird, this did not carry over to the other Fords and cars with this option are somewhat rare.", "The revised Thunderbird was initially offered as a hardtop, convertible, Sports Roadster with dealer-installed tonneau cover and wire wheels, and Landau with vinyl roof, simulated landau irons, and wood grain interior appointments. Total 1964 sales were excellent: 92,465, up nearly 50 percent from the previous year. The 1964 Thunderbird was the only car to have the word \u2018Thunderbird' spelled out on the front hood instead of a chrome Thunderbird emblem. The only transmission available was the Cruise-O-Matic MX three-speed automatic.", "Competition to this Thunderbird in 1964 included Buick's Special Convertible, Chevrolet's Chevelle Malibu Convertible, Dodge's Polara 500 Convertible, Oldsmobile's F-85 Convertible and Pontiac's Tempest Convertible.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.
