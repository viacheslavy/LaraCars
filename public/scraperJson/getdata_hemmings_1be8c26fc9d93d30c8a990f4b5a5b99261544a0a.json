Dressed in Phoenix red, it exudes the promise of fun times behind the wheel and arrives at the present day looking great - no doubt the product of a sheltered existence during its lifetime, combined with attentive maintenance. The bright shade is in very nice shape with an even shine all over that's contrasted by the fresh black rubber on its front and rear bumpers. Its low-profile hints at its road hugging prowess and you can't help but notice its unfailingly straight alignment - there are no protruding body panels anywhere you look. Also featuring clean chrome trim around very clear window glass, the visual signs are everywhere that this is one vintage vehicle very ready to hit the road without hesitation. With the flip of a switch, you can also see that the hidden headlights up front raise into place without a hitch. Its Targa top configuration allows you to transition from open air motoring to a more sheltered experience quickly and easily.", "The 89,000 miles this Porsche has logged over its lifetime constitutes pretty light usage for a car nearly 45 years old, and the fresh-looking interior has been a beneficiary. Open the door to look inside and you won't see a whole lot of evidence of wear - there are no deep creases in the black vinyl bucket seats, and you'd be hard-pressed to find so much as an errant heel mark on the fresh looking carpeting underneath. Up front, the dash area features a textured look that could very well be seen as a forefather to the carbon fiber applications we see today, and carries a trio of very readable gauges in its stock cluster that are joined by another trio vertically mounted within easy view just in front of the floor shifter. The 914's mid- engine configuration not only yields benefits as far as handling is concerned, but also affords this compact car fairly generous storage space in both the front and back, so no worries about bringing your suitcase when you decide to get away for the weekend. A straight and unmarred black pad sits over the top of the dash, and you'll find the original AM/FM radio residing in the center.", "With its 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine sitting just behind the passenger cabin, this 914 has a weight distribution that, combined with its low center of gravity, allows it to carve corners with ease. The easy-revving powerplant has been well-looked after over the years - with the paperwork backup to prove it - and is in fine operating form. It's paired with a 5-speed manual transmission that shifts easily and securely to make for an involving and thoroughly enjoyable driving experience. This German fun machine sits with its characteristically low-profile stance on a set of 15'' Fuchs forged alloy wheels, wrapped with Yokohama YK520 tires.", "Looking to take to the road for some open-air excitement at the wheel of a classic roadster with timeless good looks?

This 914 is in fantastic condition and drives great. It sports a flat four cylinder engine mated to a 4-speed manual transmission. This engine was freshly rebuilt 50 miles ago and all electronic components were gone through and inspected. The 4-speed manual shifts through all gears flawlessly. The body of this \"??74 has all of its original panels and is in excellent condition. The engine sits behind the cockpit but you don\"??t have to worry about intrusive noise coming from the rear. The exhaust sounds great coming from this peppy little Porsche. The targa top on this 914 is in excellent shape and comes right off. This fine piece of German engineering drives like a proper sports car. The silver paint on the vehicles exterior is in great condition and looks even better in the sun. This 914 will not last long get is while you can!To see 100+ HD pictures and an HD video of this 1974 Porsche 914 please visit www.GatewayClassicCars.com.

The car was very popular with the club sport weekend racers and autocrossers due to the small size, excellent balanced handling, and light weight body.

The original MSRP was $4399.00 with options that included; $3900 base price, $300 appearance group, $83 tinted glass, $18 center arm rest and $98 destination charge. Eve owned the car for 38 years, her name is engraved on a dash plaque that was fitted when the car was new, occasionally she autocrossed it at Bandmere Speedway in Colorado and was often the only women driver associated with the Porsche club in those days. Eve cherished the 914 and kept every single record and made detailed ownership notes, the kind of well documented history most collectors only dream about. Eve had the car refinished in the original Saturn Yellow at a cost of $4472 in December of 1992 and had an engine overhaul at a cost of $3348 in June of 1992 at around 70,000 miles. Eve's granddaughter sold the car in 2010 to a NW auto enthusiast and broker who then found another caring individual to keep it until the current owner a NW Porsche collector, purchased the car in early 2014 and he is technically the 3rd owner. The original owners book, stamped service book, window sticker, original keys, spare tire and jack are all present.", "This 914 just received a mechanical recommissioning by Authentic Motorcars consisting of a full service including fluids, spark plugs and wires, new fuel injectors, pump, and filter, fresh valve adjustment, new MP sensor, new belts, and a new battery. The shifter bushings and rods were rebuilt, motor mounts replaced, new KYB gas shocks and new rear springs installed as well as a new Sebring performance exhaust. The door seals are new and the targa top seal is in good condition and all electricals function as they should.", "Features include optional PORSCHE side graphics, front driving lamps, leather wrapped steering wheel, center console arm rest cusion, period yellow/black coco floor mats, an original Mohn accesory ski rack, and Fuchs type alloy wheels with Vredstein Sprint Classic tires. The original steel wheels with hub caps also come with the car. The interior is very clean, new carpets were fitted to freshen up the cabin, the original basket weave upholstery adores the seats and door panels, the dash is in great condition showing very little age.
