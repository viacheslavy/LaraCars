Powered by the original 350 cubic inch V8 engine and shifted via a 3-speed automatic transmission, this \u00c3\u00a2??Vette was made to cruise!  The Collector Edition has a special paint code, only available on this edition.  It also gave special badges, and a special decal package to set it apart from the standard \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvettes.  With just over 40,000 original pampered miles, there are still plenty of roads left to be travelled on this classic Corvette.  The original interior looks like it has only been used a handful of times and shows minimal wear for a vehicle this age.  The \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvette was the last model in a long run of the C3 chassis, and was a clean break before the C4 chassis, as there was no Corvette in model year \u00c3\u00a2??83.  The \u00c3\u00a2??82 model carried the classic design, and started integrating more and more technology until an entirely new chassis had to be designed to take full advantage of what Chevrolet had planned for the Corvette.  This example is sporting the Crossfire injection system.  The interior has a very \u00c3\u00a2??disco\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d feel; there is plenty of leather, a slick gradient pattern on the door panels and arm rest, and the signature laid-back seats that any self-respecting sports car would have.  Options on this \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvette include: Air-Conditioning, AM/FM/Cassette, T-Tops, Cruise Control Power Brakes, Power Steering, Power Locks, Power Seats, Power Windows, Tilt/Telescopic Wheel, Seat Belts, Leather Interior, Radial Tires with Raised White Letters, and Alloy Wheels.

", "  The first thing that strikes you about this coupe is the color.  Less than 725 coupes were painted in code-40 Silver Green, and this color was only offered in 1982. It looks like there has been a recent investment in a professional respray to keep this Corvette looking its best.  Of course, it takes exceptionally straight fiberglass panels to best showcase this rare finish.  The shine of this silvery hue also coordinates nicely with the optional aluminum wheels that were a great addition to these later C3s.  And speaking of the later cars, the fastback profile, deep chin spoiler, and ducktail end cap all add to the distinctive look that really makes these stand out.  Besides just looking amazing, this one earns its place in history as the final year before General Motors shut the books on the C3.  ", "  The Silver Green interior is nearly as rare as the exterior.  The metallic leather seat package that was optional on late-C3s, and since it represents its period so well, we love to see it so well preserved.   And more than just look good, this classic has appeal because it's loaded with options like power windows, power locks, power driver's seat, power mirrors, tilt steering column, electric rear defrost, original AM/FM/cassette stereo, and just about anything else GM could include in the top-of-the-line Corvette.  Tinted glass T-tops means you can have an open-air experience on-demand with this Corvette, along with ability to cool it all down with the air conditioning that's been converted to modern R134a.  ", "  The 1982 drivetrain was a preview of the new C4 Corvette.  The Cross Fire Injected 350 cubic-inch V8 was torquey, powerful, and surprisingly efficient thanks to a new 700R4 four-speed automatic overdrive transmission as standard equipment.  This is the original motor, and just like the rest of this car, it's refreshingly stock. The offset air cleaner gives it away, and you'll be impressed by how tidy everything is and how well-maintained all the vitals are. It starts quickly and easily, makes a fantastic rumble from the dual exhaust, and snaps through the gears with authority \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all making for an entertaining V8 cruiser. It also helps that there's a disc brake behind each one of those cool alloy wheels.  ", "  These final-year C3s were one of the few of this model that were built in Bowling Green, not St. Louis.  The modern factory makes these are sought-after today for their superior build quality.  Backing that up is all the right paperwork, including the owner's manual, reproduction buildsheet, and reproduction window sicker.  So this is an interesting classic with great features, and it only gets better when you realize that this total vintage package is available at such an affordable price.

This was the introduction year of the \"Cross Fire Injection\" engine which consists of two throttle bodies combined with a computer command control system which achieved better economy, drivability, and performance. Options on this 1982 Chevrolet Corvette Collector Edition include: Air Conditioning, AM/FM radio with Cassette Player, CB Radio, Glass T-Tops, Cruise Control, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Power Windows, Power Locks, Power Driver's Seat, Power Side Mirrors, Power Antenna, Rear Window Defogger, Telescopic and Tilt Wheel, Seat Belts, Leather Interior, Gymkhana Suspension, Aluminum Alloy Wheels, and Raised White Letter Radial Tires. In honor of the \"last breed\" on this Corvette body style, Chevrolet offered a \"Collector's Edition\" 1982 Corvette. This model differed from the standard 1982 Corvettes with a higher level of standard options along with a lifting rear glass, special wheels styled after the 1967 Corvette aluminum wheels, unique gold and silver exterior paint and matching interior, and \"Collector Edition\" emblems. This special Corvette has been very well taken care of and looks almost as nice as it did rolling off the showroom floor. The car also comes with a clean Carfax report along with complete documentation that includes a large binder with a copy of the original window sticker, owner's manual, and receipts that will go to the new owner. This classic just had a complete fluid service completed, the A/C compressor replaced and comes with a fitted car cover.
