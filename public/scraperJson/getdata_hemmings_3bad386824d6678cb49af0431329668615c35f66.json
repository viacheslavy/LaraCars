C3 generation of Corvettes were the stingrays patterned after the Mako Shark II designed by Larry Shinoda and executed under Bill Mitchell's direction.

The C3 Corvette though lived on being advertised as ''a more efficient Corvette'' while still maintaining the bite that wasn't currently being produced elsewhere. The 1977 models featured steel floor panels which reduced interior noise and weighed less than the previous fiberglass floors. Power levels and speed were on the rise while power everything (steering, brakes, etc) made these a pleasure to drive and handle.", "This '77 t-top stingray is in excellent condition for its next owner.

The 'vette has just recently had a lot of service work and upgrades done to it.  There are as follows: new tires, new chrome rings and the wheels have just been repainted, new upper and lower control arms with new bushings and ball joints, new rear struts, new front springs(touring), new rear springs(touring), new shocks, new front sway bar, new brake calipers(o-ring style), new pads/rotors and front hubs with bearings, new stainless steel brake lines, new rear trailing arms with new bearings, rebuilt differential with 3.08 ratio, new u-joints, new Steeriods rack and pinion steering, rebuilt TH 350 automatic transmission, new transmission cooling lines, new radiator cooling hoses, new valve covers, new alternator, new Vintage air conditioning, new upper dash pad, new lower dash pads, new steering wheel, new center console side, new shift boot, new seat back covers, new stereo with XM and Bluetooth with new front speakers.

With just over 43,000 ACTUAL miles under its belt, it's one highly sought-after piece of automotive culture featuring matching numbers and restored to an outstanding condition that reflects nothing but the best of care.", "That factory-correct Rally Red exterior is the same shade this Stingray began life with and it has been brought into the present in top quality form - just the first and most obvious of clues as to how exacting the restoration undertaken on this classic has been. A true American sports car, the Corvette occupied a very distinct space from the more commonly seen muscle cars of their era, so it's fitting that this one retains its stock configuration throughout - a model as special as this certainly needed no help in the form of customization. Its T-Top configuration, with its fold-out rear window, makes it even more special. Light as they are, the T-Tops themselves are easy to take on and off and the option allows for the open-air enjoyment of a convertible, but with a lot less wind noise. All too often, the point at which a classic's restoration is completed marks its zenith, as waning enthusiasm can lead to a diminishing standard of attention down the line. Not with this one.  Obviously the recipient of great care, it has unblemished, shiny chrome bumpers, straight trim and good rubber around the doors to go along with that beautiful paint!", "Where vintage interiors are concerned, you'll find this one awfully hard to beat. Red throughout and factory-correct like its exterior, it has also been brought back to its optimum condition. The fresh-looking leather bucket seats are surrounded by examples of timeless design everywhere and as you grip the leather-wrapped Chevy steering wheel, you'll see a one of a kind instrument cluster - almost avionic in design. The speedometer and tachometer sit before you, with the accompanying gauges for fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and battery charge residing along with the clock in the center console. Those stock gauges are all still fully functional, with surprisingly clear lenses.  You'll see that the factory-installed A/C system is still up and running, blowing out from the registers on each side of that futuristic dash. Look down and you'll see matching red carpeting and floor mats that reflect the same impeccable condition.  Additional driver comfort features include its original AM/FM radio and power windows, both of which also work without a hitch.", "The performance concept of this Corvette was represented by a fairly simple equation. Take a Chevy 327 V8, with its 300 factory horses and lower it into the compartment of a car weighing only 3200 lbs, and the result is a vintage car that's an absolute blast to drive. But this 'Vette is about more than straight ahead exhilaration. Chevy obviously put a lot of emphasis on just how cutting edge its sports cars were. The power steering you'd rightfully expect is also accompanied by a fully independent suspension and four-wheel power disc brakes at all four corners - both features not at all commonplace at the time. This 327 sits in an engine compartment that has benefited from the same attention shown elsewhere on the car, its still-stock appearance looking dry and unmarred by leaks. Connected to a 3-speed Turbo Hydramatic transmission, the engine's stock headers lead down to a dual exhaust running the length of an undercarriage that shows that same bone-dry look before culminating in the twin pipes at the rear.

She starts readily and runs flawlessly. The restoration work is documented along with the history.  Restoration details are too numerous to completely list. Highlights include new paint, glass, electrical harness, and headlight assemblies and motors. Headlights were converted to halogen; clock and radio are stock but rebuilt with updated electronics. Standard appearing speaker but with woofer and tweeter, new brakes and brake lines, tires and battery, tie rod ends, idler arms, rotors and calipers, brake pads and wheel bearings. Frame is solid with only normal surface rust. Chrome is almost perfect.  Interior is in good condition and believed to be original except for two replaced gauges and carpet. Overall it is an excellent but not perfect car, stopping short of show quality. Unexpected sale due to of a gift of a '41 Lincoln Continental taking more than its share of garage space.

Other new or rebuilt parts include brake lines, cables, fuel lines, calipers, rotors, master cylinder, power booster, electric fuel pump, fuel tank, sending unit; too much to list!", "My favorite modification on this Corvette has to be the VBP front suspension. This converts the old coil spring setup to a modern composite monoleaf (like a modern Corvette). The difference in ride and handling is tremendous! The rear suspension has also been rebuilt and includes adjustable strut rods. The power steering is essentially stock.

This one still fits together as well as it did when it was new, with decent gaps and flush-fitting headlight doors that are a big part of the look.  We're also a big fan of the fastback styling.  The metallic silver paint was one of the best colors on the later C3s, and it has helped this shark-nosed classic look cool in modern times.  This is believed to be mostly the original factory paintjob.  So it might show some age compared to other cars, but most of us give survivor cars some serious bonus points from at the Corvette shows.", "Inside you can tell plenty of option boxes were checked off on this one.  It starts with giving you the choice between body-colored roof panels or glass T-tops (with storage bags.)  But our preference is to have these out and the car open to the world.   That way you get to showcase the great color combo of the black interior against the silver paint.  The comfortable bucket seats demonstrate the underlying feeling that makes this Corvette special \u2013 a well-respected and maintained classic.  This is seen throughout the interior with its door panels, carpeting, and full gauge cluster looking quite original and complete.  Even the optional AM/FM stereo with 8-track player is even still in place.  While that's more of a novelty today, the more luxurious options include the power windows, power locks, and provisions for factory air conditioning.", "Lift the hood, and this collector's car looks like a time capsule.  The 350 cubic-inch motor is numbers-matching, and looks like it has been kept original right down to the factory decals. This V8 appears only to have been given good routine maintenance, including newer hoses and belts.  In fact, with this kind of condition, it's quite easy to believe that the low mileage is actual.  The V8 inhales deeply through a correct Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority out of the dual exhaust tips.  This is mated to its correct TH350 three-speed automatic that is always able to handle the torque this V8 can throw down.  Chevy built these to be great cruising cars, and so the fully independent suspension, power steering, BF Goodrich T/As on Rally wheels, and four-wheel disc brakes really make you want to drive this coupe every weekend.", "Complete with the original warranty card, owner's manual, and other original docs, you're looking at a survivor-grade classic that's also a tempting driver.  And so when this package is priced so right, you know you need to hurry on this deal.
