Sitting on top of it all is 650 Speed Demon carburetor feeding it The MSD Pro-Billet distributor MSD 6AL electronic ignition control MSD blaster 2 coil and MSD 8.5 heli-core wires provide a strong spark to max to ensure proper combustion. The exhaust gasses are released quickly through a set of ceramic coated long tube Hooker headers that give off a powerful growl! As you approach this Camaro and open up the door to get in you will notice quickly the completely reupholstered interior with hounds tooth inserts in the seat setting the sixties style off right. As you slide in and get behind the wheel fire it up the engine comes to life quickly. Put the top loader four-speed manual transmission in first release the clutch and start to cruise! The power is available at the blip of a throttle and the competition Engineering A-link traction bars subframe connectors and aftermarket bushing provide a firm yet comfortable ride.

Engine options were as many as 12 in 1969 with three main packages that included the RS, SS and Z/28 with several special packages sold through GM and specialized dealers of performance parts and installation.", "This particular RS/SS Camaro is a very well done.  It is powered by a 383 stroker v8 with according to the owner capable of 500 horsepower.  The car was restored in 2005 and shows very well.  The Camaro has power brakes(discs in front and rear), power steering, headers, aluminum radiator, aluminum heads, Auto meter gauges, console shift, front bucket seats, Billet Specialties steering wheel, Kenwood CD player, Boyd Coddington wheels, Toyo tires, tinted windows, dual exhaust and more.  This is a stud inside, outside, and underneath! It's a lot of fun to drive and an absolute head turner.
