It's believed there have been only three previous owners over the last half-century, and all of them have treated this V8 sedan like they were custodians of history.", "1966 was a radical design departure for Ford's intermediate line of cars.  The quad headlights of the previous year were now turned vertical to give this a taller, more substantial presence.  The body design had a bit more of a kick-up at the rear, which gave it a sportier personality.  Overall, this new Fairlane was arguably one of Ford's most attractive designs of the 1960s, because it offered an elegant simplicity that had a hint of European influence. The factory-correct Arcadian Blue looks terrific, and that's because someone invested in a quality respray to make sure this sedan retains its '60s glory.  Speaking of 1960s nostalgia, it's hard not to love all of the details, like the wraparound chrome bumpers, 289 callouts on the lower fender, and the factory wheel covers.  This one even still wears the dealer ID on the trunk lid from when it was sold new in Atlanta over 50 years ago!", "The dark blue interior against the light blue paint is one of our favorite color combos.  To have it so correct and original on this car gets us excited.  Plus, the higher trim on the 500 series means some great wood applique to go with your sea of blue.  This one is a well preserved total package, so the factory steering wheel gives you a clear view to the extra wide speedometer.  As you gaze across the dash, it's great to have all the features working \u2013 from the heat/defrost sliders to the factory AM radio.", "This sedan was optioned with Ford's C-code 289 V8 motor.  With the date-correct code and such a great original-style presentation in the engine bay, we have no trouble believing this could be the original powerplant.  This is the same dual-barrel carburetor unit that was available in the Mustang, so this has plenty of power to keep this classic running with modern traffic.  Plus, the optional three-speed C4 automatic transmission is flexible enough that you can take this car everywhere from around town, to long trips down the highway.  And that's the true point of a vintage sedan like this.  It has been cared for all its life so that when the time is right, it's the classic car experience you can share with family and friends.", "Complete with owner's manual, this Fairlane has just past its golden anniversary, and it's so well preserved, that it's ready for its next half-decade.

A first-generation red Mustang convertible is the car that defines an era and is always in demand.

But to properly own this icon, you need to standout just a little bit.  That's why this one has a sportier attitude that you instantly see from any angle.  Up front it's the addition of the hood pins and hood scoop; the sides have upgraded Mag wheels; and the rear has the dual exhaust coming out of the valance like a cool GT machine.  But even with these upgrades, all your favorite pieces are still in place. There's the correct grille with the running pony emblem, 289 badges on the fenders, and the three-element taillights.  Plus, the bumpers have recently been re-dipped so these chrome kings can truly catch the sunlight \u2013 exactly what you want on a sunshine-friendly droptop.", "The white roof looks great in place, especially as it coordinates with the tire stripe.  But a classic like this was meant to be shared with the world.  And when out fold the roof down, this cheery white disposition turns to a darker performance attitude.  We really like the presentation of the bucket seat interior that look like the door panels and carpeting have received recent attention.  This is a great place to experience vintage driving thanks to the classic three-spoke sports steering wheel with Mustang center cap, and the center console with T-bar gear shift for the three-speed automatic transmission.  And while this looks factory-correct, right down to the trunk mat and a full-sized spare tire, there are some nice upgrades.  For example, the retro-style AM/FM stereo has a digital tuner and an input for modern music players.  And the upgrade to white faces on the round gauge package adds to the clarity and sportiness.", "The 289 cubic-inch V8 looks like it has received the right attention and investments.  It's nicely dressed with its bold blue block, shiny valve covers, and Monte Carlo bar across the top.  Plus, this one is upgraded for power with the hood scoop feeding the performance air element, Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and Edelbrock intake.  That means an extra kick of V8 power going down the road and an enhanced rumble from the dual exhaust.", "A red '66 Mustang convertible is always in demand, so when it's priced so right, you know you need to hurry to grab this deal.
