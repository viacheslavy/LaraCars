The odometer reads 41,260, which is the actual mileage on the car. Options for this 1977 Lincoln Mark V include: Air Conditioning, AM/FM Radio, Cruise Control, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Power Locks, Power Seats, Power Windows, Tilt Wheel, Seat Belts, Leather Interior, and White Wall Radial Tires. Powering this long blue Lincoln is the original 460 CID V8 engine, which is mated to the original 3 speed, C6 automatic transmission. A new carburetor, fuel pump, and gas tank were added during a recent tune up, as well as the white wall, radial tires that have approximately 100 miles on them. This 77' Lincoln received a respray of the original blue paint about a year ago, and looks great, as does the blue vinyl section of the roof. The light gray leather interior features blue accents throughout, and is in great condition, free from any rips, tears, or major wear. The Continental Mark V was produced and sold by the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company from 1977 to 1979. The Mark series was a personal luxury coupe, and the Mark V was the largest version to ever be produced of any Mark series, in fact it was the largest mid-sized car ever produced. It was longer than its GM rival the Cadillac Eldorado by nearly 6 inches. During its three year production run it averaged 75,000 units sold each year, again beating the Eldorado through 1978. The Mark V differed from the Mark IV in that it featured hideaway headlights, round opera inspired windows in the sail panel, a spare tire contoured trunk lid, and the most prevalent change, the chrome plated front grille. These cars feature an incredibly long hood, 7 feet to be exact.

It looks good drives good and has been very well mechanically maintained over its lifetime.     The car has been owned by the current owner for 10 years.  The restoration was done prior to him buying the car, but it shows excellent for the age of the restoration. The car  runs and drives very well.       Recently underwent a complete electronics restoration by John Ashman (the renowned guy for Lincoln continentals) All windows, doors, convertible top, and related electronics operate well.  The trim is all very clean, straight and polished shiny.  The paint shows very well and is straight.   The top is in excellent shape and functions perfectly.   Other work done includes:    - All bushings in front suspension have been replaced   - Brand new fuel pump  - Aux and fuel gage   - All electronics gone through 6 months ago   - key fob for top  - power kill switch    Great car at a great price.  this one won't last!

Yes, Lincolns! Cars like this 1954 Lincoln Capri were renowned for their big horsepower, tidy handling, and bulletproof construction, making them a favorite among competitors in the grueling (and deadly) Carrera Panamericana cross-country races held in Mexico.   ", "  Of course, this handsome Capri sedan was never a race car, but the same virtues that made it popular with racers also serve it well on the streets. The tidy proportions bely the massive luxury machines Lincoln would become later in the decade, but the upscale design and ornamentation leave no doubt that this was a top-of-the-line car in 1954. The Ivy Green paint is a refreshing change from the pastels and plain black sedans of the period, and helps the car stand out without being undignified, which wouldn't suit a Lincoln at all. Finish quality is excellent and it's just a quick polish and wax away from being truly spectacular. It's got a great shine and the bodywork underneath is laser-straight, suggesting it has never been wrecked or rusty, and all four doors close with that incredibly solid ker-chunk sound that is always so reassuring. Plenty of chrome and stainless trim ensures nobody will mistake this for anything but a Lincoln, and it remains in first-class condition throughout, including the wonderful taillight housings and ornaments ahead of the rear wheels.  ", "  We have a lot of reasons to believe the interior is original, from the handsome patterned cloth upholstery to the ornate tri-tone door panels that blend into the dashboard. It's possible that the carpets have been replaced at some point, but even they have some patina that makes everything look consistent. It's loaded with power options, which should be expected on a car of this stature, including a power seat, power windows, and cold A/C, which appears to be an early add-on unit under the dash and not built into the trunk the way the factory would have done it. Either way, it's effective and most of the hardware tucks neatly out of sight. Sliding levers for the ventilation controls, an array of simple gauges, and an AM radio built into the dash instead of simply jammed into a slot all give it a very neatly finished look. We especially like the patterned applique that covers the glove box and wraps into the door panels, making the Capri feel light-hearted and not at all frumpy like most luxury cars of the period. And you do get a giant truck with an original mat and full-sized spare with jack assembly.  ", "  The 317 cubic inch V8 was all-new in 1954 and with overhead valves, power was way up over the flathead before it.

This 1947 Lincoln Continental Convertible has power windows, a power convertible top and a factory AM Radio. It is powered by a 292 cubic-inch side valve twelve-cylinder engine capable of producing 130 horsepower. There is a three-speed manual gearbox and four-wheel hydraulic actuated drum brakes. The elegant body rests comfortably on the 125 inch wheelbase. The Lincoln Continental was the brainchild of Edsel Ford and executed by Ford's chief stylist, Bob Gregorie. The Continental was introduced in 1940 as an exclusive, luxurious, handcrafted automobile for the status conscious consumer.    The early Continental was recognized by the Museum of Modern Art as one of eight automotive 'works of art' and by Time magazine as one of the top ten best-designed commercial products. The post-war design was a continuation of the short-lived 1942 model but with a heavier grille. Continentals continued to be a top-of-the-line automobile and were highly desired after the war. Many luxury features were standard.    This particular car runs and drives beautifully so if you are in the market for a solid 1947 Lincoln Continental Convertible, do not miss your chance to own a great American Classic; cars of this caliber do not come along too often and are hard to get.

Original owners included many of the biggest names in Hollywood and industry. This is a very clean Mark II with an older restoration. It looks good and drives great. It's a solid straight car with very nice chrome, trim and glass. It has genuine leather upholstery which is worn in some areas (see photos). Paint is very nice. Body fir is very good. The odometer indicates 64,000 miles and although it looks like it could be accurate we cannot verify miles and the title states \"odometer exempt\" because of the vehicles age.

She told us that her late neighbor, a Chicago doctor, had passed away close to ten years ago and his wife was now moving out of the house and was going to sell his cars. The garage where the cars were stored was right up the street, so we went on over. The elderly widow let us into the garage and told us all about her husband and his cars; meticulous only begins to describe the late owner\u2019s care for the cars. The garage was well lit, neat, and had a Freon system mounted on the wall so he could maintain the cars\u2019 air conditioning systems himself. Underneath just a thin coat of dust, it was very clear that these cars were in close-to-new condition. We were told that the Lincoln was the doctor\u2019s daily driver, while the T-Bird was his weekend car. The Lincoln is truly a nearly-perfect \u201csurvivor\u201d car; it has just 39,720 miles on it and carries itself down the road like a real dream boat! It\u2019s unbelievably smooth, quiet, and refined. It\u2019s a fully loaded luxury car with a digital dash display; it is absolutely the pinnacle of early 80s opulence. I cannot think of anything more enjoyable to eat up highway mileage in.", "Exterior:", "White paint is original throughout, as confirmed with an elcometer. There are no spots of touch up paint anywhere on the car. The body is in excellent shape, with absolutely no dents or dings. Chrome is perfectly intact and free of oxidation or dents throughout, even on the lowest points of the car. White paint looks great in contrast with the blue pinstripes and blue leather interior. Paint shines bright and shows very little signs of age; it\u2019s very clear that this car was garage-kept and babied since new. All lights, including lower fogs, are clear and crack-free, as is all glass. There are no wiper streaks or nicks on the windshield. Wheels are in nice shape, with only slight evidence of curb-rubbing. Tires are Firestone FR680s with 80% tread remaining and no dry rot. Overall, the condition of the exterior is very impressive. This is a true survivor car that looks and feels very much like it did in 1983.", "Interior:", "While the exterior is in absolutely phenomenal condition, the interior presents even better. Light blue leather seats are extraordinarily comfortable and are in like-new shape. Carpeting is perfect as well, with no fading or stains or tears. Wood grain dash shows no aging whatsoever, it shines bright and looks as-new. There are no dash cracks or warping of the plastic. Digital display works flawlessly, and features tech that is impressive to see on a car from the early 80s. Buttons on the dash, which are all functional, allow the driver to track fuel economy, trip distance and ETA, in addition to changing from mph to kph. All powered systems function without fault \u2013 R134a air conditioning, heat, front and rear defrost, original radio and speakers, cruise control, powered windows, powered seat adjust, and power locks. The car is equipped with an alarm system with a push-button kill switch mounted under the dash. There\u2019s also a CB radio mounted under the dash. Headliner is tight, and the rear seats, much like the rest of the interior, are mint.
