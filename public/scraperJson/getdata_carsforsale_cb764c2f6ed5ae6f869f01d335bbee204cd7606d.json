The history of this car is well documented.   The car retains its original license plates (California blue plates were issued to this car brand new in 1969) and even the original dealer license frame from the SoCal dealership it was sold from.  The car also has a copy of its original California pink slip as well.  This very collectable and original car is one of  Only 1,628 made in 1969 with only 649 in Bright Yellow; #'s matching engine, transmission and rear end.  Comes with Marti report as well as the original  build sheet and pink slip too. The mechanical rebuild of the engine (with Dyno sheet) has only 30 miles on full rebuild with full receipts.  Posi rear currently with 3:50 gears but original 3:90 gears come with car.  The car has a newer carburetor on it but the original carburetor comes with the car.   The car is all original metal.  Magnum 500 wheels. Disc brakes.  Fresh weatherstripping.  David Keyes top loader shifter.  Factory spoiler, louver delete car, AM radio and rare square clock option!  This car is so original even the  upholstery on the seats is still original!!!        This same car was the Motor Trend Cover Car (same color not actual car) Boss 302 !!!

this car since 1972. It's been stripped down to bare metal and had no rust at all (has pics). It still has all of its original metal. Painted a smooth glossy red top to bottom, inside and out. Completely updated driveline including the engine is an actual Boss 302 motor with aluminum heads, intake and water pump. Had a Quickfuel carb, has MSD ignition and headers going to a custom stainless exhaust system with crossover pipe. It sounds like a cross between an American muscle car and a foreign sports car. The front of the motor is completely decked out with aluminum components including brackets and a serpentine pulley system. Has big aluminum radiator with twin electric fans to make sure it stays cool. Shock towers removed, front end has completely been converted to a tubular suspension with coil over shocks and rack and pinion power steering. Tubular rear suspension with coil over shocks. Upgraded with power 4-wheel disc brakes. New Vintage air conditioning system, it blows cold. TCI built automatic transmission. All of the exterior chrome and trim, weatherstrip and windshield have been replaced. Sharp looking new set of chrome Torque Thrust wheels and 15 inch BFG tires. Interior is completely restored. Seats are recushioned, reupholstered red stitching was used. New dash pad, door panels, armrests, headliner, visors, carpet etc. Pioneer stereo system.

"18908", "description": ["This 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 fastback has every trick you could want wrapped in standout package. Beneath the bold blue lies serious firepower in the form of the original 351 V8 rebuilt and supercharged to 650hp.  Plus, upgrades to the four-speed, suspension, and even the interior are all part of a full restoration that fortifies this total performance Ford.  ", "  This one is all about getting that genuine Mach 1 Mustang feeling while also being distinctly upgraded. The factory-correct blacked-out hood mixes with the proper gold Mach 1 stripes on the side and rear to give this both an aggressive and upper-class appearance.  Plus, the large hood scoop and rear wing are always great performance signposts.  You see all these features so clearly because this is a long term labor of love that took this coupe down to the bare metal.  All imperfections were addressed and the panels were stitch welded for greater strength.  Only after the body was made its best was paint allowed back on the sheetmetal.  The blue has all the right tones to be a 1969-correct Acapulco Blue, but in this case, the modern clearcoat really gives it a greater depth like a deep blue ocean.  But even as this coupe has all the right pieces for its iconic year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the mirror-like chrome bumpers to proper badging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is also a nice hint at the upgrades within.  The large 18-inch Halibrand-style wheels on the lowered suspension is a clear signal to true Mustang fans to really watch out for this one.  ", "  There is no better muscle car interior than black, but this one does it better with added aggression and comfort. For starters, Ford was going for a more luxurious image with these coupes, and you see it in factory pieces like the center console and all that wood paneling.  But take a closer look, and you'll see some great upgrades.  For example, you could get high back bucket seats with the aggressive red streaks from the factory, but these leather TMI units take Ford's Comfort Weave style and add modern bolstering and cool red stitching.  Even the stereo is a modern Bluetooth unit disguised as a knob-style radio.  You still get the factory three-spoke steering wheel that gives you a commanding view of the full gauge panel, including large tach.  But now you also have a set of auxiliary gauges in the center console to keep you fully informed.  And just in front of that is likely your favorite feature.  After all, the Hurst cue ball shifter is an icon all on its own.  ", "  Usually having the original V8 under the hood is the main item people want to talk about, but on this one, there is something even more special. That shiny ProCharger supercharger looks great, and more importantly, gives this 351 V8 a serious upgrade in power. With the ability to create some muscle, the rest of the V8 was fortified to handle the performance.  It was rebuilt to include a .030 bore, Quick Fuel four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock Victor Jr intake, and Canfield aluminum heads.  The total output was dyno certified at 650hp at the crank.  Making sure the rest of the package could handle the monster motor meant the original four-speed was rebuilt by Dan Williams Top Loader Transmissions.  Plus, the 9-inch rear was rebuilt including a new limited slip differential and a versatile 3.50 ratio.  Plus, the suspension upgrades include thick sway bars front & rear, new urethane bushings, and traction bars.  Stopping is also well in hand with a full Wilwood four-wheel disc brake package and the modern grip of Nitto NT555 tires.  ", "  There's so many more features to this amazing build, so you should call for all the details.  But you already know this is the kind of classic build that only comes around once in a lifetime.  How cool is it to drive a supercharged '69 Mach 1? You'll never know unless you call today!"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1969 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "113 .

And for many of us, there's one in the past that got away, and now with prices on these cars skyrocketing, we thought we'd never get to own one of these awesome cars. Well, this 1969 Boss 302 tribute offers a more affordable way to own a legend, one with a few smart upgrades that you'd never find in an original Boss, and a high-dollar rotisserie restoration to boot, making this car the best of both worlds.  ", "  Now, we're not going to tell you that this is a real car, because you've already figured that out by the price. It's a very fresh restoration that's built for showing and driving, and if you've experienced a Boss 302 already, then you know that driving is what they do best. Grabber Orange isn't this car's original color, but it's the right color on a Boss, so that's what went on when the car was refinished. In fact, the paint is only six months old and has about 14 miles on it, so it's incredibly fresh and bright and done to a very high standard, completed by one of the most respectable shops in Atlanta. The Boss graphics are expertly applied and the body doesn't show any critical issues that would suggest a checkered past and the blacked out hood and deck lid are painted satin black for effect. Factory rear window louvers, a factory rear spoiler, and the blacked-out tail panel all work well with the bright orange paint and gorgeous chrome bumpers to give this Boss just the right look.  ", "  The black interior is especially nice, with new seat covers on the original buckets, correct door panels, and the critical Hurst shifter. The seats look upscale in the Mustang's all-black interior, and you can see why this was such a great place to do the serious business of driving fast. Factory gauges are original, but they work just fine and there are new bulbs inside, so they light up brightly at night. The original AM radio is gone, replaced by an AM/FM/iPod stereo that fits like it was born there. The shifter is a proper Hurst unit, complete with cue ball knob, but you'll note that it now manages five gears, not four, making this Boss a weapon on the street yet comfortable on the highway. The back seat looks almost new, and the neatly finished trunk offers a correct plaid mat that fits rather well.  ", "  The 302 cubic inch V8 that is the heart of the Boss looks awesome in the engine bay and even though it's not the real thing, it sure looks convincing.  It's correctly dressed in Ford Blue with a big air cleaner and proper reproduction decals, all of which make the 1969s unique. Upgrades include an Edelbrock intake manifold and Holley 4-barrel carburetor, and there's a Comp Cams bumpstick inside that gives it that famous cackling boss idle. It starts easily and runs great, pulling the car around with genuine authority. The 5-speed transmission doesn't mind the e"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1969 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "113 .

", "  This pony car started out as a L-code hardtop coupe, but it was destined for much more.  The glossy silver is attention-grabbing, but what really draws them in is the front end.  Custom ghost flames in a faint shade of metallic pink make this coupe look like there is some serious aggression below the surface.  And this one even backs up this intimidation in its details like the front air dam, fog lights in the grille, and dark rear spoiler.  Plus, while the bumpers and dual exhaust tips shine nicely, we know your favorite piece of brightwork is the set of those cool American Racing solid wheels.  ", "  The forceful attitude continues with an all-black interior.  From the door panels, to the seats, to the dash, to the carpets, everything in this Mustang looks like midnight. This is truly setup for the driver with a factory premium steering wheel that gives you a clear view of the full round gauge panel.  Plus, there's a nice auxiliary gauge trio.  But passengers won't feel like an afterthought thanks to features like cup holders and the upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo for everyone to enjoy.    ", "  Under the hood is a cool presentation of diamond plating on the fender walls and plenty of gloss black accessories.  But your favorite part should be the 289 cubic-inch motor.  We believe it was rebuilt around 1,000 miles ago, and this trusty V8 now also has performance upgrades like a Holley four-barrel carburetor and Weiand intake.  They add an extra kick of power to the V8 and help the glasspack-style dual exhaust have an extra deep growl.  But more than just a mean machine, this one was built to be an easy driver.  Features like three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, front disc brakes are great to have when you want a vintage coupe that's easy to drive on a whim.  ", "  A cool classic with some nice upgrades is always a fine choice...especially when it's this affordable.  But you're not the only one who can fit this Mustang into the budget.  So don't miss out, hurry up and call today!"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1969 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "113 .

As a base car, there is no faux Mach 1 style woodgrain overlay surrounding the very rare factory installed tachometer cluster or distracting the passenger view which gives the interior a contemporary look. Because this is a factory CJ, it has all of the same mechanical upgrades that the CJ Mach 1 received including Competitive suspension (swings, front sway bar, shocks), power front disc brakes and larger rear drums, reinforced shock towers and reinforced export braces, 9-inch rear axle, heavy duty cooling, fast ratio 16:1 steering (power assisted with PS fluid cooler in this car), and 14x6 styled steel wheels with F70x14 wide oval belted tires.

That doc book also contains additional items authenticating originality; pictures that show casting dates and matching assembly plant build tags on transmission and axle to the build sheet.

This 1969 Was just freshened with a full repaint, although not in the original Black Jade with Ivy Gold interior, the Red base coat clear coat exterior is a very close match to contemporary Race Red with Black Standard Trim Interior which was also freshened with new carpet and complete underlayment. As well, the trunk has been cleaned and resprayed and includes a correct spare wheel/tire. To Keep this 47-year-old car running and enjoyable to drive, all maintenance and wear items have been addressed. Cooling, brakes, fuel, power steering, ignition, suspension, lighting, and radio have all received a rebuilt and or upgrade. To modernize the driving experience, the front suspension has been upgraded to a stealthy Bilstein coilover system designed and built by a dedicated classic Mustang-only suspension shop that proves his systems on the track and street.
