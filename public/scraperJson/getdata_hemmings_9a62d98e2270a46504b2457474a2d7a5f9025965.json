A new radio powers a set of speakers in a box behind the seats for a great sound to your favorite songs.

Storage behind the seats is easily accessed and is surprisingly roomy.", "Exterior", "Beautiful Red paint really pops against the chrome accents and rally wheels. The removeable hardtop is painted to match and is in great shape. Rally wheels with new radial tires provide a classic and clean look.  Too much red? Put up the soft top to break it up with some black.  The curves on C3 Corvettes are very feminine and voluptuous.  It's no wonder guys can't stop staring at a 68 Corvette!  The working flip up headlights add to the sports car appeal and the dual chrome exhaust tips exiting the rear look and sound great.  Less than half of all Corvette convertible received an auxiliary hardtop in 1968 and a lot of those have lost their soft tops through the years. This is a very cool find with both tops.", "Conclusion", "If you're looking for a fun, reasonably priced chrome bumper C3 Corvette convertible, take a close look at this beauty.
