Through five generations GM has continuously provided us with a variety of purpose-built performance packages that normally wouldn\u00c3\u00a2??t make it off the boardroom floor. When it comes to high dollar classics, you simply can\u00c3\u00a2??t go wrong with a first generation Z/28. Pedigreed, well-done small block cars continue to be some of the hottest selling metal on the market. And this documented, investment grade Z/28 has all the right ingredients to bring big value and even bigger appeal. For starters, it\u00c3\u00a2??s an authentic Matador Red car which features a correct Red interior. It also packs a correct 302 that\u00c3\u00a2??s equipped with a rare cross ram intake. The power is transferred through a tough Muncie 4-speed and correct 4.56 gears. If you\u00c3\u00a2??re in the market for a restoration-fresh collector car that you can enjoy and build equity in, this slick F1 demands your full attention! The beneficiary of a professional, rotisserie restoration that included $38K of paint and body work, this vivid panther simply glistens under our bright showroom lights. Craig Hopkins, of Cleveland, Georgia\u00c3\u00a2??s AMD Installation Center, put a lot of effort into making sure the car\u00c3\u00a2??s body is extremely straight. Everything has been bathed in DuPont Matador Red. Raise the solid steel hood and you\u00c3\u00a2??ll be delighted to find a rare Winters cross ram on top of a correct, 302 cubic inch high performance V8. Rebuilt at Precision Engines LLC, this fully balanced mill utilizes a forged SCAT crank, forged SCAT rods, SRP pistons and a Bullet Trans Am-spec cam to twist stout 11 to 1 compression into 344 dyno-proven horsepower! At the top of the 302 small block, Holley carburetors mix fuel from fresh stainless fluid lines with oxygen that\u00c3\u00a2??s piped through a chrome, cowl-fed air cleaner. Behind those carburetors, modern electronic ignition sequences spark through fresh Packard TV R Suppression Cables. And at the sides of that ignition, authentic \u00c3\u00a2??double hump\u00c3\u00a2?? heads hang bright chrome valve covers over roller tip rocker arms and professionally restored exhaust manifolds. When fired, the infamous V8 snarls and barks like a real competition piece. Its ancillary components are top-notch in every way, with fresh GM hoses and a correct Delco Moraine brake booster accompanying a reproduction Delco battery. And an even combination of Chevy Orange engine skin and Satin Black fender framing is accented by clean and appropriate decals. the best set up the Camaro offered was a tough Muncie transmission and track-worthy 4.56 rear end. This coupe\u00c3\u00a2??s correct 4-speed, which is equipped with a fresh clutch and flywheel, twists a shortened A-Body pumpkin that\u00c3\u00a2??s packed with new Moser axles, a proven Eaton posi and 4.56 Richmond gears. That first-rate drivetrain is held off the ground by a completely rebuilt, high performance suspension, which includes 4-piston, Corvette-style brakes, tuned front coils, multi-leaf rears and reproduction shocks. That suspension is dissected by an aluminized, true-dual exhaust system, which is fitted with a correct, transversely mounted muffler. That exhaust system is framed by clean floors which perfectly highlight a new stainless fuel tank, fresh stainless fluid lines and a variety of chip-free chassis components. Those floors roll on 15-inch Rally wheels, which spin E70-15 Goodyear Wide Tread GTs around correct stainless center caps and dent-free trim rings. Inside, the Standard Red interior illustrates the true, no frills intentions of Chevrolet\u00c3\u00a2??s hallowed Z/28. Its bucket seats were restored with new backs, new foam and reproduction covers that look and feel fantastic. In front of those seats a stainless-trimmed dash, which exhibits no signs of warping or peeling, hangs rebuilt telemetry above a clean radio delete. At the base of that dash, great looking carpet centers a chrome Hurst shifter between"], "title": "1968 Chevrolet Camaro ", "total_results": "103", "price": "135000", "kilometers": 31917.733, "total_pages": 6, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/30491824", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "30491824", "year": "1968", "model": "Camaro", "specs": {"Engine": "302 CID V8", "Mileage": "19,837 miles", "Exterior Color": "Matador Red", "Transmission": "M22 4 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}}
