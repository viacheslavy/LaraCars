Triple black with new power top. 390/3-speed on the tree. Beautiful original paint and interior. Runs and drives like a new car, smooth, powerful, confident.", "This 1965 Mercury Monterey convertible is one of those wonderful survivors that combines low mileage with excellent care over the past five decades to create an almost-new driving experience wrapped in a car that still looks fantastic. This is an original black-on-black car, so it was this sinister-looking when it was new, and the semi-gothic look of the 1965 Mercurys seems to work best in black. The paint is unquestionably original, with a nice gloss and great coverage, but with the usual signs of use here and there. And the best thing about being a survivor with original paint is that you know there are no patches, no botched bondo work, and no body rot waiting to surprise a new owner. The chrome is likewise in great shape, with shiny bumpers, a crisply rendered grille with no cracks or breaks, and plenty of cool styling details like the speed streaks on the leading edges of the front fenders. Look at it closely\u2014this is a really handsome car!", "Code 26 black vinyl is what it says on the door tag and that's what's still living inside, a handsome two-tone gray and black setup that separates the Monterey from its lesser siblings. The upholstery is original, including the carpets, and that should tell you all you need to know about just how well-preserved this car really is. The power front bench seat is still supportive and comfortable enough for long cruises and the door panels are elegantly simple with just the right amount of bright trim. Mercury gave you a full array of instruments in round housings and someone has very neatly installed a small tachometer in the right-most opening, a detail that is so right that it could pass for a factory job (yes, it works!). Interestingly, this Monterey offers a 3-speed manual with column shift, an unusual find in a full-sized luxury convertible, but one that also gives it a bit of a sporty demeanor. The back seat looks almost completely unused and if there's any real demerit inside this car, it's that there's some light fading on the transmission tunnel carpet, but that's not unusual with black carpets in convertibles and I wouldn't even consider replacing it. The black power convertible top is just too nice to be original, and offers a glass rear window, all of which disappears under a nice-fitting black boot. The trunk is very original, with factory-issued mats and gray spatter paint, but zero rust issues and a full-sized spare with jack assembly.", "In the horsepower department, this big ragtop moves like a muscle car thanks to its original, numbers-matching 390 cubic inch V8. Still wearing its original 2-barrel carburetor, it generates the smoothest wave of torque you've ever experienced, moving the car with effortless ease. It starts quickly and easily, settles into a smooth idle almost immediately, and never gets cranky no matter what you're doing. Sure, it's a little scruffy under the hood, but that's original bright orange paint on the air cleaner and valve covers and there's plenty of evidence of proper maintenance over the years. Some surface rust on the radiator cradle is nothing to worry about, and if you're eager to make it sparkle, a weekend of cleaning and selective painting could take it up a notch without erasing too much originality. On the other hand, if you're like me and like to drive, you won't mind a little dirt and instead will simply enjoy the way it works.", "The three-speed manual transmission makes it a lot of fun to drive, and with 3.00 gears out back, it's a fantastic highway cruiser with very long legs. Around town, it's easy to let the 390's big, flat torque curve pull you around in top gear, making downshifts almost unnecessary for anything but a dead stop, and it really is so smooth and quiet that you need to check the tach to be sure it's still running. Flashy Cragar mags are brand new and make a huge difference in the car's attitude, but if you're a purist, there are also two sets of original hubcaps in the trunk that you can retrofit to a set of steel wheels for a factory-original look. Those fat 225/70/15 Mickey Thompson radials are brand new, too.", "Fast, comfortable, stylish, and just unusual enough to attract attention, this awesome black Merc does everything a collector car is supposed to do, all at a very reasonable price.

Down's body, stretched Pro-Street chassis, 502 big block, spectacular custom interior. Magazine feature car. The best of everything, very fast, fully sorted.", "Based on a Down's body and Pro-Street chassis, this Chevy offers spectacular bodywork with deep, dark Indigo Purple paint from Sherwin Williams that looks like a million bucks, especially with the traditional flames licking out of the header cut-outs. The fiberglass was expertly prepped and the gaps are tight enough to slide a piece of paper between them, but not much else. You'll note that the hood is a highly modified steel piece that opens from the top and offers cut-outs for the headers that wrap into the front fenders\u2014very cool. It was also lengthened six inches, a real trick in itself, which gives the Chevy a dramatically different look in profile. Instead of basic Chevrolet transportation, it takes on a fantastic long hood/short deck look of the great Classics of the 1930s, a look that emphasizes speed and power. Other body mods include rear fenders that tuck under the bodywork to provide a little protection for the ultra-wide rear tires, Frenched LED taillights, a flip-up rear license plate bracket, and a billet grille to give it a smooth look. This is one Chevy that's going to stand out anywhere you take it.", "The interior uses a special batch of ultra-leather created to exact match the paint. It's hard to get the colors exactly right in photos, but in person, it's not only the same color but there's also a hint of metallic that makes it glow like the paint. It's extremely impressive. All that ultra-leather was wrapped around a TEA's Design bench seat that does a pretty good impersonation of a pair of buckets with a fold-down armrest between them. Custom door panels were created just for this car and include latch hardware that make it easy to get in and out. A center console was fabricated and holds the Lokar shifter as well as controls for the power windows and trunk and the AM/FM/CD/iPod stereo head unit. A full complement of Auto Meter gauges monitor the big block up front and the monster tach was neatly recessed into the dash for a very unique look. One particular detail that immediately jumps out is the custom floor mats with billet scuff plates, a great solution to the problem that goes in a very different direction. There's also a tilt steering column, a custom wheel wrapped in purple leather, and a trick B&M shifter that manages the reverse manual valve body TH400 3-speed automatic transmission underneath. The power windows motor up and down quickly and easily, there's a ton of sound-deadening materials inside so it's always comfortable, and with the wheelbase stretch, there's plenty of legroom for even very tall drivers. The trunk is mostly full of wheel wells and fuel cell, but it's beautifully finished with a custom embroidered logo of the car itself and a small access panel for refueling.", "Power comes from a thundering 502 cubic inch Chevrolet V8 living under the hood. It's an easy fit with the extra length up front, so the firewall wasn't radically cut. For reliability, they didn't modify the crate motor's internals (550 horsepower should be plenty, no?) but they did dress it for show, starting with that incredible Speedway Motors \"shotgun\" hood scoop up top, and yes, it does move with the throttle. In fact, almost everything on top of the motor is polished or plated, including the alternator, valve covers, and intake manifold. Yes, it's got the firepower to need those big tires, but it's never grumpy or difficult to drive and that's no small feat.", "The chassis is a Down's Pro-Street piece built from rectangular steel tubing for a rock-solid foundation. The front suspension is polished stainless A-arms and coil-overs, plus a TCI rack-and-pinion steering unit that gives the coupe great reflexes on the street and feels quite natural to drive. Long-tube headers extend outside the chassis and run into a set of Borla polished stainless mufflers and oval exhaust tips under the running boards\u2014again, aggressive but easy to live with on the street. The aforementioned TH400 3-speed automatic feeds a custom driveshaft and a narrowed Currie 9-inch rear end with 4.33 gears inside. Wilwood supplied disc brakes for all four corners and a custom 4-link with coil-overs and a race-style sway bar holds up the rear endIt's also beautifully finished for show, with most of the chassis wearing the same Indigo Purple paint that the body wears, and anything that wasn't painted was either polished or plated to really show off the hardware. It comes by its Pro-Street name honestly, too, thanks to big-n-little Billet Specialties wheels wearing Hoosier performance radials.", "This is a stunning car and you don't even have to be behind the wheel to see it. We have build photos showing the entire process and there are no shortcuts and no expense was spared. It's a magazine feature car and uses the very best components throughout. There's big, reliable power that's also comfortable enough to make this a legitimate Power Tour candidate. In short, a rod that does everything well, including act like a hot rod.

Great colors, new black canvas top, everything works. New shocks, tires, bushings, and tune-up. Ready to go and very affordable!", "Silver always looks great on German cars, and this SL is no exception. That's factory-applied paint that's now 30 years old, yet it still looks great thanks to a combination of high-quality materials and expert care over the years. Well known for build quality, you'll feel it the first time you slam a door, and you'll note that the gaps and panel alignment are as good today as they were when it was new. It shines up nicely and aside from a few acceptable signs of age and use. Obviously there's no rust on a car that has lived through foul weather indoors, and the handsome blue and red pinstripes running the length of the car add a bit of contrast that works quite well. The big rubber bumpers were US-spec, but over the years they've become familiar, and those on this car are in excellent condition with no dried-out parts or cracks. The remaining chrome is quite good overall, with nothing notably deteriorated or too new, so it has an all-of-a-piece look.", "Blue leather seats are a nice upgrade over the more common MB Tex vinyl, giving the well-trimmed interior a more inviting look. There's a bit of wear on the driver's seat, which you'd expect, but it's purely cosmetic with no splits or tears in the hides themselves. The scuffs could be easily re-dyed, but we kind of like the comfortable, lived-in look it has right now, making this car a little less formal and more inclined to have some fun. Big analog gauges remain fully functional, including the temperature gauge in the center A/C vent, which was factory equipment, not an aftermarket add-on. In fact, the service records suggest that whenever this car had a problem, it was promptly fixed and everything works as it should: A/C, power windows, locks, and mirrors, and the original Becker Grand Prix AM/FM/cassette stereo and its accompanying power antenna. Like all R107s, this SL comes with two tops, a brand new black canvas folding top and a removable hardtop that stores on a matching stand when not in use (which will likely be most of the time if you're doing it right). The trunk isn't huge, but it's beautifully finished and has enough room for a weekend's worth of baggage for two, and there's a full-sized spare tucked underneath.", "As the name would suggest, the 380SL is powered by a 3.8 liter V8 that was new in 1981. By 1984, it had been significantly revised and upgraded, most notably with a double-row timing chain that eliminated the problems found on earlier cars. Few cars are better for long road trips than this, and you may even find that fuel economy is decent. The engine bay on this one is tidy if not detailed, and there's plenty of evidence of proper maintenance over the years, including recent hoses, belts, and tune-up parts. It's quite clear that the car has never been used in the winter, as all the aluminum parts are still bright and shiny without the white corrosion that rust-belt cars develop. Turn the key and it starts quickly, idles smoothly, and never gives any indication of fussiness.", "The 380 SL also received a 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, which not only improved road manners and performance, but fuel economy as well. Imagine cruising at 75 MPH with the engine ticking over at a shocking 1300 RPM. That's the 380SL. The undercarriage is quite clean for a 33-year-old car and again, no signs of rust or rot in any of the structural components, especially the rockers. There's a correct factory-style exhaust system, recent fuel pumps in back (there are two, just in case), and newer shock absorbers all around. Familiar 14-inch Mercedes-Benz \u201cpie crust\u201d wheels are in good shape with a few minor scuffs, but you'll also note it still wears correct wheel weights and valve caps, suggesting someone cared about keeping it all OEM. There are also recent 205/70/14 Michelin blackwall tires that look and handle great.", "Documented with its original books and manuals as well as extensive service receipts, this is an R107 that you can buy with confidence. With a bulletproof reputation for reliability, an excellent history, great colors, and a very reasonable price, it's ready to travel with you next summer.

Loaded Pearl Red with tan leather interior. Digital gauges. Chrome wheels with new tires. Everything works, runs and drives superbly. Nice car!", "Truthfully, the 1993 Allante is really the only one you want to own. The earlier cars were nice, but with 50% more horsepower, the Northstar completely transformed the Allante. Pearl Red was the catalog color and showed up in all the ads, and that's for a good reason: it exactly right on the angular Allante bodywork. The shape hadn't changed since the introduction, although the Northstar cars got a slightly deeper chin spoiler that made it look a bit more aggressive. The red finish is still brilliant, shiny, and incredibly attractive (no wonder it was on the cover of all the catalogs) and you can count on strangers asking you what color it is. There's just enough chrome to remind everyone it's a Cadillac and the little Cadillac symbol on the trunk also being the CHMSL is a neat touch.", "The luxurious interior was state-of-the-art in the early 1990s, and like the exterior, it has aged well. The handsome tan leather buckets are extremely comfortable and supportive and show almost no wear thanks to high-quality materials. Yes, there's a little scuffing on the outer bolster but it's quite minor and certainly in line with the car's age and mileage. Otherwise the interior appears to be as new and everything works, which is important in a car this complex. You'll note that it has the optional digital gauges (a very reasonable $495 on the window sticker), which remain bright and crisp and fully operational\u2014pretty rare in the world of Allantes. The AM/FM/cassette/CD stereo sounds great, even today and even with the top down and there's a lovely carpeted package shelf behind the seats. One other reason to own a 1993 Allante is the improved convertible top, which uses power header latches and a motorized pull-down to make folding and securing the top a lot easier, although it's still best to practice a few times before you really need it. And, of course, there's a fully lined trunk that's big enough to be useful for road trips.", "It would be a mistake to dismiss the Allante as a poser, because the 300 horsepower Northstar V8 is potent as hell. It looks handsome under the hood thanks to a special engine cover (one of the first of its kind) and the distributorless ignition was also a first for GM. With proper maintenance over the years, it runs superbly, starting quickly and idling smoothly even when it's cold and it pulls the roadster around without ever seeming to work very hard. There's absolutely no sign that it has ever seen winter weather and all the factory decals are still in place. I'll leave it to the experts to determine whether it's worthy of showing, but the sucker sure does run beautifully.", "You also get a snappy 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission that always seems to find the right gear and doesn't mind dropping down to give you the acceleration your right foot is calling up. The chassis shows well, with zero evidence that it has ever seen winter weather and even the stock exhaust looks like it's got plenty of life left in it. Four-wheel disc brakes with ABS are powerful and it sits on beautiful chrome wheels with fresh 225/60/16 blackwall radials, as original.", "Documentation includes the original window sticker, showing a whopping $62,870 MSRP, and those are 1993 dollars!", "We've sold a number of these and we always forget what great cars they are. Fast, comfortable, and surprisingly fun, it's still a great Cadillac. We love this color combination and with low mileage and great maintenance, it's a great car to own. But don't just take our word for it, come drive it and see for yourself. The Allante is an awesome convertible to own.
