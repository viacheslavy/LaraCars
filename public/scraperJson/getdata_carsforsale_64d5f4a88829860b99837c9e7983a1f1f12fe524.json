With \u00c3\u00a2??65 being the first official year of the Mustang, some early build cars were called \u00c3\u00a2??64.5\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d cars, and had unique options. One of those unique options is the 289 CID V8 engine perfectly set under the long, sporty hood. Backing that with a 4-speed manual transmission makes for a great driving experience anywhere you go. This Stang is painted in Bright Cherry red that shows very well.  The car was professionally repainted about a year ago during its frame off restoration and it shows they did a very nice job.  The body panels align like they should with minimal gap variation.   All of the exterior body trim, emblems, & window trim is in great condition.  The 289 CID V8 went through a very recent rebuild by D&A General Auto here in Houston, TX roughly less than 500 miles ago.  During that rebuild the engine was bored .30 over & had a race camshaft installed to give it that muscle car loping sound we all love.  The engine also features a new high flow Weiand carburetor, electronic ignition, & long tube race headers.  Looking towards the interior you will find several fairly new items such as the vinyl seats, new carpet, door panels, & a cool que ball shifter.  The dash is also in excellent condition showing the gauge cluster & glove box in like new condition.  The car has new 15 inch wheels that are wrapped in new Barum tires.   The car also features disc brakes in the front, new front & rear struts with air shocks in the rear.  The undercarriage of the car looks great as well, showing hardly any traces of rust with new bushings in all the right places & components.  This a great car at a great price that anyone from a high school graduate to a new retired executive could enjoy for years to come.  The car features new door speakers that are powered by a CD player with AM/FM radio.

This pony has a heart of the original 289 V-8 churning its hoofs down the pavement with a 3-speed C4 automatic transmission to work its way through the herd. The engine only has roughly 50 miles on it since the rebuild and runs very strong. Put the top down and enjoy the weather and driving as it was intended. The rear end is running on 2.79 gears to make for great cruising. The PPG acrylic enamel red paint on this car is in great condition and compliments the car very well. It was repainted only a year ago and still looks great. There has been some minor rust repaired done to the inner fender walls and core support to make sure this car is cancer free. The Hood was replaced but still looks great on this piece of American muscle. This \u00c3\u00a2??67 has undergone a full restoration along with reproduction exhaust, NOS carburetor kit, and NOS emblems and trimming. This car has a good amount of stopping power with the disc brakes being added to the front wheels. Fisk Classic Steel Radial tires are what put the traction on the ground and still have plenty of tread life in them for those cross-country road trips. The interior is in great condition and is a nice black vinyl. This car also features a power top to provide some ease when you want to stay out of the sun. From the floor, door panels, and dash they all remain in great condition. This car needs a new owner and put back on the road for everyone to enjoy its presence. You wouldn\u00c3\u00a2??t have any issues winning your local car shows with this beauty. Please come by our showroom and take a gander at this gem.

HISTORY  The Ford Mustang was brought out five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00c2\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964\u00c2\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

Frey was the head engineer for the Mustang project - supervising the development of the Mustang in a record 18 months from September 1962 to March 1964 - while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. One of the design requirements established by Ford for this Mustang was that it should be a 4-passenger car and this has been neatly accomplished while still retaining much of the ''coupe'' look. The 1966 Mustang debuted with moderate trim changes including a new grille, side ornamentation, wheel covers and gas cap. Ford's new C-4 ''cruise-o-matic'' three-speed auto transmission also became available for the 225 hp V8. This '66 Mustang Hardtop has lots of appeal, from it long, low lines to its recognizable engine growl it's what made this ''America's Favorite Fun Car''. There is plenty of room for the driver to get into the Mustang, the door being well placed in this respect, the bucket seats are above average and the shift lever is within comfortable reach. We're offering this 1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop adorned in RED over BLACK VINYL. This classic comes with $472 (in 1966) dollars in Extra Charge options including the CRUISE-O-MATIC 3-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, 289CID-2V 200HP V-8 ENGINE, POWER STEERING, RADIO & ANTENNA, TINTED GLASS WINDSHIELD, 2-SPEED ELECTRIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS & DAY/NIGHT REARVIEW MIRROR.
