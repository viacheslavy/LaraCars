So it's amazing such a thorough build can also be so obtainable.", "The customization of this Mustang is apparent from every angle.  See that deep cutout in the front bumper? That gives this one the appeal of a Shelby GT350 R.  The hood pins look like they were necessary to tame this beastly bulging hood (and we'll tell you exactly why they're needed a little later.)  Plus, the rear has a custom spoiler and the Shelby-style tail lamps. More than just a sporty style, this pony has shed some extra weight thanks to the custom hood, trunk, side scoops, and front bumper utilizing lightweight fiberglass.  That's why you could almost call the paint name ''Quicksilver.''  This metallic clear coat looks great in the sunlight, and it provides the right tone to lay down the iconic dual racing stipes, as well as the GT350-inspired rocker stripes.

But once you slip behind the wood and chrome sports steering wheel, you begin to feel the tingle of performance that this Mustang radiates.

It's been enhanced further with performance components such as aluminum heads, Edelbrock Air Gap intake, Holley 715 CFM four-barrel carburetor, HEI distributor, 7qt. aluminum oil pan, and a Northern aluminum radiator to keep it all running cool.  The full package is said to produce 450 horsepower, and everyone will know your power superiority by the growl of the Cherry Bomb dual exhaust.  The C4 three-speed automatic transmission (likely regional) has been reinforced to handle all this extra power.  This feeds a stout Detroit Locker Ford 9-inch rear end on its way to hitting the streets.  Take some time to look at the undercarriage shots where you're going to spot some great components.  This includes traction bars, Shelby-style steering arms, KYB shocks, and sway bars front & rear.  Making sure the stopping was in line with all these upgrades, there's now a four-wheel disc brake package.  And the reason why all these components look so good is there's less than 16,000 miles on the build, and only about 4,000 miles on the motor and transmission.", "The sale comes with a detailed photo book that takes you through the entire restoration down to bare metal.

The Mustang is a true legend as it is responsible for the whole Pony Market/Craze that swept the late 60\"??s and into the early 70\"??s. When many of the other wannabe pony cars ceased production the Mustang model is still going strong with over 50 years of production since the beginning. With so many early Mustangs produced sometimes a little something different is needed to make your Stang stand out from the others. From the outside this just looks like another \"??C\"?\u009d code 65 Mustang. Actually this coupe was a originally a 6 cylinder Mustang as indicated by the \"??T\"?\u009d in the VIN. Engine swaps are popular and definitely a nice way to set this Mustang apart. Pop the hood and a late model factory fuel injected 5.0 engine will greet you. The restoration on this beauty was performed about 8 years and this is when the 5.0 EFI V8 was installed. The 4-speed automatic AOD also found its way into the Mustang. Not only does the AOD give you an extra gear for cruising but it is a much stronger and reliable transmission than the C4 transmission that originally came with this car. Keeping this coupe well maintained the current has had the following items replace in the last year; fuel tank fuel pump carpet headliner front brakes alternator cam lifters cylinder heads reworked timing chain set and 19 lb fuel injectors are all new pieces. If you are looking  for a 1st gen Mustang with a modern drivetrain then give us a call. Options for this 1965 Ford Mustang Include; AM/FM radio with CD player Seat Belts Cloth Interior Aluminum Alloy Wheels with Radial Tires. .

It was an interesting idea. Due to the harsh driving conditions that these cars were subjected to by rental drivers, many were taken out of commission and did not survive. Years later, originals that did endure are extremely valuable and easily net $150,000 or more at auction. Our 1965 Mustang coupe is a tribute to this Ford/Hertz concept. When it was restored 10 years ago, the exterior was refinished in Raven Black with GT350H gold accent stripes. Mustang GT steel wheels with radial tires and a classic GT hood scoop provide nice finishing touches to the exterior. The black vinyl interior was restored back to original. Some new elements include: seat upholstery/foam, carpeting, headliner, door panels/armrests, windshield glass and weather-stripping. The Mustang three-spoke wheel/horn components are also new and a Sony stereo furnishes your sounds. A Ford 302ci small block that is upgraded with an aluminum intake, Holley carburation, MSD ignition and tube headers w/2-1/2'' pipes powers our Mustang. It is backed by a 3-speed automatic transmission. The factory differential has new ring and pinion gears and new bearings. Brakes are standard 4-wheel drum units with new shoes and cylinders. This is a very nice Mustang GT350H tribute car that will sell quickly. ALL VEHICLES SOLD ''AS IS''."], "Exterior:": "Black", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "29650"}},
