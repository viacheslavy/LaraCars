For luxury-minded buyers, it was hard to beat the cache of bodywork that was so obviously hand-made, and Chrysler was certain to emphasize the car?s connections to the good life: yachts, hunting, and horses were the mainstay of period advertising. The cars commanded a premium when they were new, which made them rare, but time and the elements inevitably claimed most of the natural materials on neglected examples, making finding a good Town & Country today a rare thing indeed.", "This 1949 Town & Country convertible offers an all-new body style that was revamped in 1949 to reflect the trend towards longer, lower, and wider styling. At once contemporary and traditional, the wood was no longer structural but became decoration, which preserved the car?s good looks while improving structural rigidity and serviceability. Featuring a full frame-off restoration to extremely high standards, this handsome convertible was a repeat show winner and remains an exquisite automobile today. The Gulf Green finish is correct, and offers a soft contrast with the woodwork and tan convertible top. The ash framework is original and has been fully restored. Paint and chrome are outstanding, and this has never been a rusty car or in need of body panel replacement. The stainless has been buffed, and it offers a highly detailed hood ornament that?s simply spectacular. This car is very impressive at every level.", "The interior offers a traditional late-40s look with durable and attractive tan Bedford cord and contrasting green leather, a tasteful combination that works well with the light green bodywork. As inviting as a wood-paneled study, it was fully restored with the rest of the car and shows almost no wear or signs of use. Correct light green carpets, wonderfully trimmed door panels with lots of bright accents, a leather-wrapped padded dash, and particularly the back seat all look as new. The instruments are housed in a single pod ahead of the driver, as was the fashion at the time, and they are crisply rendered and fully functional. All the chrome remains bright with sharp details, and accessories like the heater and radio operate correctly. The tan canvas top has probably never been folded, and offers a small glass rear window in place of the original plastic curtain for a more formal look. In the trunk, you?ll find original sisal carpets and a restored steel wheel that is in need of a matching spare tire.", "Mechanically, the 1949 Town & Country was largely carryover, including the 323 cubic inch straight-8 engine. In this car, it was fully rebuilt and detailed for show, demonstrating bright silver paint on the engine, proper ?Spitfire? spark plug loom, and an oil bath air cleaner. The massive heater/defroster assembly dominates the passenger?s side of the engine compartment, and remains fully functional, quite useful during our sub-freezing photo shoot. It starts quickly and easily and settles into a powerful-sounding idle with eight cylinders purring away. It?s linked to Chrysler?s famous Fluid-Drive transmission, a curious blend of a manual transmission with a torque converter, but in practice it?s quite easy to drive around town. On the highway, the big eight cylinder stretches its legs and can cruise effortlessly at modern highway speeds thanks to a set of 3.54 gears retrofitted out back. The chassis was also detailed for show during the frame-off restoration, and shows only the most minor signs of use and needs nothing more than a quick wipe-down to be ready for the show field. Correct 8.20-15 BFGoodrich Silvertown wide whitewall tires were fitted and correct full wheelcovers sparkle like new in their centers.", "The woodies were dying off in 1949, but the Chrysler Town & Country remained the un"], "title": "1949 Chrysler Town and Country ", "total_results": "115", "price": "64900", "kilometers": 134322.538, "total_pages": 6, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/18651390", "brand": "Chrysler", "reference_id": "18651390", "year": "1949", "model": "Town", "specs": {"Engine": "323 cu in Straight 8", "Mileage": "83,482 miles", "Exterior Color": "Gulf Green", "Transmission": "Manual 3-Speed", "Interior Color": "Tan Bedford Cord With Green Le", "Drive Train": "Other", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

Back in 1955, NASCAR stock cars were, in fact, stock production vehicles. Except for some crude safety equipment and numbers on the doors, they were almost indistinguishable from the cars the public could buy. With absolutely no financial support from Chrysler, Mercury Outboard founder Carl Kiekhaefer campaigned a fleet of white 300s during the 1955 NASCAR and AAA seasons with drivers like the Flock brothers (Tim, Fonty and Bob), Norm Nelson, Buck Baker, Speedy Thompson and Frank Mundy to name a few. ", "The Kiekhaefer 300s were spectacularly dominant and overwhelmed the factory-backed Chevrolets and Fords. Tim Flock took the driver\u2019s championship while winning 18 races. He finished in the top five an astounding 32 times. His brother, Fonty, took another three victories, while Chrysler campaigner Lee Petty took home three trophies. Suddenly, the 300 had a glorious racing heritage in addition to its advertised Hundred Million Dollar Looks. ", "Considering the short model year for that first 300, 1,725 were sold at an expensive $4,109 base price. ", "This was the car to start the legacy. It had Virgil Exner\u2019s distinctive styling and the 331hemi. The 1955 300 had a two door coupe body and clean, simple Chrysler Windsor side and rear quarter trim. Up front were two large Imperial \u201cegg crate\u201d grilles. This first of the letter series cars did not actually bear a letter. Chrysler\u2019s original manuals named it the C-300, which was an appropriate name for the car. The \u201cC-\u201d designation was applied to all Chrysler models, and the 300 stood for the engine horsepower. ", "It was THE first modern American production car to achieve this output. Power came from an updated source already available; the fabled \u201cHemi\u201d331 cubic inch hemispherical head engine, modified with a \u201cfull race\u201d cam, larger dual exhaust, and topped off with 2 4-barrel carburetors. The suspension was made firmer, allowing it to handle far better than most cars. It was given a special performance PowerFlite transmission, while the inside remained pure luxury. ", "Notably, it was fast. The battle lines would be drawn, when it did 127.58 mph in the flying mile at Daytona, and averaged 92 mph in the Daytona Grand National stock car race. This car dominated the stock car circuit, earning the NASCAR and AAA championships its first year out. ", "The car was only available in three exterior colors: Black, Tango Red and Platinum, combined with a luxurious tan leather interior. ", "The Chrysler 300 \"Letter Series\" Are High-Performance Personal Luxury Cars That Were Built By Chrysler In The U.S. From 1955 To 1965. The C-300 Was Really A Race Car Aimed At The NASCAR Circuits And Known As The First Muscle Car. ", "In The Inaugural Year For This Model, There Were A Total Of 1725 Cars Produced Of Which Only 15% Are Believed To Be In Existence Today.", "Features On This Most Stunning Automobile:", "The design was simple but strong without much chrome on the sides, creating the illusion of fast forward movement.

It has taken many forms, adhering to the styling evolution of the times and the cars that bared the name. Ultimately, it was a success and in the early days these cars exemplified Chryslers commitment to quality and are true icons in many ways. The stage was set for these cars with the pre-war \u201cBarrel Back\u201d variants that are highly coveted today. With the war efforts converting Chrysler to its civic duty, these cars only returned in 1946 were the name-plate remained but a redesign offered an entirely new product. During this time (1946-1949) Chrysler offered a 2-door convertible variant as well as a 4-door sedan. The two door variant, known as the \"Newport\" named after the wealthy Newport, Rhode Island community was a 2-door pillarless coupe with \"Clearbac\" rear window (Chrysler's term for a partitionless rear window). It was also the last year for the true \u201cwoody\u201d Town and Country. Thus, the 1950 Newport Town and Country is both rare and highly coveted with only 700 examples produced carrying a base price of $4,003 making it one of the most expensive coupes in Detroit's lineup in 1950.", "The example on offer, a 1950 Chrysler Newport Town and Country, chassis number 7411576 is finished in black with a properly contrasting cream roof and black and grey interior. We know that the car was delivered new in Pennsylvania and lived there with the original family until the 1980's. At which time a Chrysler Dealer and collector in Stamford, CT acquired time the car. Then trading hands again to the more recent ownership in Rhode Island and then Virginia. Today, it remains in excellent running and driving condition with no known issues noted. This is no run-of-the-mill, or restored example. Rather, this car is one of those original examples that is offered only once in a lifetime. The opportunity presented here is the ability to own a preservation quality example of a relatively limited production car. Not only is the Newport the last of the Chrysler woodies, and a true icon of its time, it was also an engineering milestone for Chrysler being the first four wheel disc brake car built. It set a precedent with the finest craftsmanship utilizing the best materials coming together to produce superb driving comfort with ample power and gorgeous lines to attract the wealthiest of buyers.", "Cosmetically, the car shows as a fantastic, well-preserved car in remarkable condition. There are welcomed instances of patina that show the cars marks of originality and genuine condition. The way it is today is the way it has always remained. The white ash wood trim is all original and the lacquer shows very well, matching the quality and theme of the rest of the car. The original paint is consistent and presents well throughout. The glass which appears original along with the chrome, are all in excellent original condition as one would expect from a car that has been garaged and well-cared for throughout its life. All of the original rubber moldings are still in place and surprisingly supple. The shut lines, gaps and panel fitment are as it would have been from the factory. There is no door sag, nor is their any trouble opening or closing any doors/trunk/hood.", "Inspecting the interior, it remains obvious that the car is a genuine original example. There is just enough wear to match the 67,763 miles indicated. The leather and corduroy inserts show the appropriate amount of patina for a car that has been sparingly used. All of the knobs, pulls, and switches work as expected and everything is complete down to the fantastic art-deco window cranks.

With Hemi power, a cool '50s paint job, and as much luxury as you could fit into a 4-door sedan, it's an awesome (and affordable) alternative to a Cadillac or Lincoln of the same period.  ", "  Wearing a very 1950s pink paint job, this awesome Imperial looks like a very original, well-maintained car that's always been treated as something special. There's a respray at some point in its history, but it was a while ago, so the car has a very comfortable and authentic look that should be left just as it is. Obviously it's never been wrecked or rusty and those four doors open and close like the proverbial bank vaults, a testament to Chrysler's build quality. The styling is very reminiscent of the mighty 300, to which this car is directly related, and the proportions disguise its mass, because this is a very big car indeed (at just over 19 feet long, it held the record for largest non-limousine sedan until the 1970s). The white top adds some contrast and keeps it from being pink overload, so if you're man enough, you will enjoy driving it. It wouldn't be a '50s car without plenty of chrome trim, and this one dazzles with lots of jewelry, from the heavy bumpers to the twin grilles to the taillights perched on top of the rear quarters, a styling cue that would last into the '60s. The trunk ornament is an eagle, another design element that would endure for years to come, and there's simply no angle from which this car doesn't look awesome.  ", "  The two-tone black and pink interior is simply stunning. It's original, so it's a little faded and shows some minor wear, but there's just nothing cooler than the patterned brocade cloth that was endemic to high-end cars in the '50s. The two-tone steering wheel with horn ring is big enough to make you feel like the captain of a ship and the beautifully styled door panels are an ideal blend of materials, shapes, and colors. Sporty round gauges in a sculpted instrument panel look fantastic and it's loaded with options like working A/C, power windows, and power steering spelled out right on the horn button. The AM radio isn't working, which is a little sad, but you'll be thrilled to see how quickly the power windows zip up and down. The trunk is, as you'd expect, truly massive and it's equipped with a full-sized spare and jack assembly.  ", "  Yes, it's got a HEMI, a 354 cubic inch version to be exact. Under that late-model air cleaner there's an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor, installed to help drivability as much as horsepower, and this sucker is strong! It idles nicely and pulls, well, like you'd expect from a HEMI. With a modern A/C compressor, it looks a little different than it would have in 1956, but things like the generator, radiator, and heating system all have their traditional '50s look.

The Imperial is every bit an equal for the Lincoln, and perhaps out-performs the Blue Oval on the road, offering superlative handling and a great deal of horsepower under the hood.  ", "  If you're going to drive a giant luxury sedan with the exclusivity of a country club, then you really need to paint it black. Black looks better on Engle's work than almost any other color and it makes the already gigantic Imperial look about the size of a locomotive. In truth, the styling is restrained and conservative, but you can see the elements that make it familiar: the slab-sided bodywork with minimal ornamentation, the single strip of chrome running from nose to tail, and, of course, the simulated spare tire on the trunk lid. If you want to make a grand entrance, few cars can do it better than this. The paint is believed to be all-original, and shows signs of age and use, but it doesn't seem to diminish the car's impact and we might consider just leaving it as-is and maybe giving it a buff to bring up the shine. All the original chrome and stainless trim is completely intact, from the split grille up front to the heavy door handles to the cool eagle medallion on the trunk that also doubles as the gas filler door. If '60s cool is your thing, there's nothing cooler than this.  ", "  The interior is still big luxury, with a conservative look that fits the mid-60s perfectly. The odd square steering wheel is gone and the dash is a bit more conventional, but you'll note it still offers a cool ribbon-style speedometer and a full array of secondary gauges. Aircraft-style switches mange the lights, wipers, and other controls and yes, that's a pushbutton TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic, still the coolest way to change gears ever invented. The translucent steering wheel is in fantastic shape, something you rarely see on these cars, and for being entirely original, the cloth and leather seats and carpets are holding up pretty well. Power windows became standard equipment in 1964 and this car carries factory A/C, which remained an option. There's also an AM/FM/CD stereo hidden in the glove box, which is a nice addition. Back seat space is cavernous and, as you'd expect, that long rear deck conceals one of the largest trunks of all time, complete with a full-sized spare tire.  ", "  The ultimate luxury is power, and the 413 cubic inch engine is a relative of the motors that powered Chrysler products to wins on the drag strip. Of course, in the Imperial, it's impeccably smooth and torquey, able to move that massive bodywork without breaking a sweat and it's a spectacular high-speed cruiser. The engine bay is largely original, dominated by the big air cleaner and A/C compressor, but it's all there and in good working order.
