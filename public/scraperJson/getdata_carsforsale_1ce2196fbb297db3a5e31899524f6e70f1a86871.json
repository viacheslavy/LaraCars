This iconic numbers-matching 1968 Oldsmobile has a 455-CID V8 Rocket engine with only 73,600 original miles. This all original survivor was a very smooth and powerful vehicle in 1968 and outputs an amazing 365 HP and just over 490 lb. ft. of torque! What makes this legend so interesting is that the Oldsmobile Rockets made from 1968-1976 tend to be more desirable engines because of their heavier castings, beefier crankshafts, and better flowing heads. This 1968 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight survivor is uniquely set off by its original factory Ivy Green exterior, pristine conditioned matching interior, traditional muscular stance , swooping rear quarters and all of the untouched originality. As you look inside this classic Olds you will notice the incredible condition of the unique interior that looks as if it has never even been sat in, and the attention to detail in the design that is the very reason that Oldsmobile luxury cars had such lasting success.  This Detroit time capsule is complete with 15'' inch chrome Oldsmobile hub-caps, radial tires, air conditioning, AM/FM radio, power brakes, power steering, power seats, power windows, tilt wheel and that vintage cloth interior. This untouched 1968 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight is an American legend and survivor that is sure to incite nostalgia and create many more memorable moments.

Take this 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass, for example. Same underpinnings as a Chevelle, but with a different look, more luxury, a comfortable ride, and an upgraded drivetrain, it makes a lot more sense for a lot less money.  ", "  This car's white-over-blue combination is flat-out awesome. You don't see white cars that look this good very often, and that's entirely due to the subtle combination. The paint is a few years old, but white never goes out of style and looks great almost indefinitely. Up close you can see a few signs of age, but even from five feet away, this car totally nails it. It hasn't been dressed up like a 442 clone, which we like, and the clean, rounded lines of the Cutlass really give this car a great look. The blue pinstripe that highlights the curve of the front fender is a nice touch, and yes, it used to have a vinyl top that was removed during the repaint and the flashy chrome trim highlighting the lines remains. Nice chrome bumpers, that cool stainless trim along the rockers, and the subtle OLDSMOBILE print in the trunk edge all add up to a car that stands out without making a lot of noise about it.  ", "  The blue bucket seat interior is just drop-dead gorgeous thanks to correct reproduction seat covers, beautiful door panels with inlaid woodgrain panels, and that familiar Oldsmobile dash. The car has been driven (which is a good thing) so there are a few minor signs of wear, but the materials are high quality and they wear like iron so it'll look this good for years to come. The original steering wheel is showing its age, but that's an easy thing to change and with everything else looking so good, it might be worthwhile down the road. The handsome gauges cover the basics and look great in the burled walnut fascia, and yes, this is a factory A/C car with a lot of new hardware working behind the scenes. There's also an upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo with custom speakers in the kick panels and rear package shelf, and thanks to Olds's more luxurious status, it's nice and quiet inside. The console houses the shifter for the updated 2004R 4-speed automatic transmission, which makes this car a fantastic high-speed cruiser. There's also a massive trunk that's in good order with a full-sized spare just in case.  ", "  The Oldsmobile 350 cubic inch V8 has its own unique personality and shares almost no parts with its corporate cousins of the same size. Instead, it focuses on torque, making this Cutlass feel quick around town. The engine was rebuilt in 2013 and it's tidy under the hood if not detailed to perfection. There's a stock air cleaner up top and we like the blue valve covers and other details, which tie it together with the blue interior quite nicely. Note the upgraded A/C compressor and other components, as well as a recent alternator, so it's ready to go. In fact, it's been driven extensively and made the drive"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass ", "total_results": "750 .

This is a blue convertible equipped the 455 CID V8 and automatic transmission. It has a gorgeous and well maintained black vinyl interior. With GM tossing out the 400 cubic-inch limit for intermediates and the 4-4-2 now coming standard with the larger 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 from the big Oldsmobiles and previously used in the 1968-69 Hurst/Olds, Olds discontinued the 400 engine entirely and also offered the 455 as an option in the Cutlass S models and the Vista Cruiser wagons. There was an SX option that became available in 1970 and was available only on the Cutlass Supreme hardtop and convertible. The SX cars all had the 455 engine and TH-400 automatic transmission. This car is equipped with A/C, automatic convertible top, power brakes, power steering, seat belts, vinyl interior, radial tires and rally style wheels. This car is clearly a gem and shouldn\u00c3\u00a2??t be passed up at this price. Call the Houston showroom at (832) 243-6220 for more information on this vehicle.

So when you can find a coupe that has all the right faithful tribute looks, and at an affordable price that leaves some money in your pocket, then this one is just the ticket for the value-mined muscle car enthusiast.  ", "  Code-58 Burnished Gold is this coupe's original color, and it makes Olds/GM fans excited because the 442 often looked the best in this precious-metal hue.  Today the bright paint has a bit of extra luster thanks to a professional respray. And speaking of shine, the newer bumpers have a great mirror-like appearance, and on the Olds coupes of this era that's particularly important.  The front bumper gives this coupe the classic American appearance, and few companies were better at integrating the chrome rear bumper into the sheetmetal design than Olds.  But we really know it's the aggressive details that have you hooked on this.  The dual black hood stripes, correct badging, and the color-match large rear spoiler are great 442 touches.  And Oldsmobile's iconic Rally II wheels.  ", "  From the moment you step inside, you can instantly tell this Olds has a dual luxury and a performance mission.  This is best seen on the bucket seats.  This has a great factory-style pattern that features durable vinyl for the high wear areas and comfortable cloth inserts around the lower and upper portions so you can wear shorts anytime.  And in-between these is a sporty center console with a bold golden gearstick.  There's plenty of period-correct luxury like the burled walnut dash appliqu\u00c3\u00a9s and three pod-style stainless steel gauge faces.  These go great with the upgrades like the wood and chrome steering wheel, auxiliary gauge trio, and AM/FM/CD stereo with aux input.  It creates a total package that is vintage appeal and modern convenience.    ", "  Oldsmobile people know that a Rocket 350 cubic-inch motor is something very special.  Olds manufactured their own V8 engines during this era, and they were quite different than the Chevy version.  These golden blocks are beefy motors that have proven to be virtually indestructible out in the real world.  And we always love to see a period-correct Rochester four-barrel carburetor allowing this V8 to inhale deeply.  The Hooker Competition long tube headers contribute to the power increase as well as help make a meaner rumble out of the dual exhaust.  But even with all the added attitude, this Olds doesn't lose its premium feeling.  With features like power steering and the three-speed automatic transmission, there's an easy drive behind the aggressive appearance.    ", "  A great factory color, all the right 442 touches, and plenty of rumble from the V8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a total package kind of classic.  So, if you're quick enough to grab it, your search for the perfect value-priced Olds is over.

Personal Luxury Car That Was Produced From Model Years 1966 To 1992. Designed To Compete With The Thunderbird And General Motors' Own Riviera, The Toronado Is Historically Significant As The First U.S.-Produced Front-Wheel Drive Automobile Since The Demise Of The Cord in 1937.  The original Toronado began as a design painting by Oldsmobile stylist David North in 1962. His design, dubbed the Flame Red Car, was for a compact sports/personal car never intended for production. A few weeks after the design was finished, however, Oldsmobile division was informed it would be permitted to build a personal car in the Riviera/Thunderbird class for the 1966 model year, and North's design was selected. For production economy, the still-unnamed car was to share the so-called E-body shell with the redesigned 1966 Buick Riviera, which was substantially bigger than North had envisioned. Despite the efforts of Oldsmobile and General Motors styling chief Bill Mitchell to put the car on the smaller A-body intermediate, they were overruled for cost reasons.    Oldsmobile had been working on front-wheel drive since 1958, a project shepherded by engineer John Beltz (who originated the 442 and would later become head of the division). Although initially envisioned for the smaller F-85 line, its cost and experimental nature pushed the program towards a larger, more expensive car. Engineer F. J. Hooven of the Ford Motor Company, had patented a similar FWD layout, and Ford was seriously considering the design for the 1961 Ford Thunderbird. However, the time to develop and engineer such a design in such short notice made this a doubtful proposition.  Oldsmobile spent seven years developing the Toronado. Prior to its introduction to the public, over 1.5 million brutal test miles had been performed to verify the strength and reliability of the Toronado's front-drive components. Obviously, Oldsmobile did not want anyone to experience problems with the new design. History has confirmed the Toronado design was indeed heavily over-built; the GMC motorhome of the 1970s, which used a basically unchanged Toronado-derived drivetrain, stands as a testament to that fact. Nevertheless, the re-introduction of front wheel drive earned the new Toronado Motor Trend Car of the Year honors in 1966.    Naming the Toronado was also an event in itself. Some other known names being considered during development are: Magnum (later used by Dodge), Scirocco (later used by Volkswagen) and Raven.
