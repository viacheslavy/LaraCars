I have a folder 8\u201d thick of receipts of new parts for this car. And when I say receipts, I have everything from the engine and transmission, to every nut, bolt, & gasket, down to the antifreeze! It was not a $100,000 body off restoration; however I would consider the car the highest end driver quality that will impress anywhere it goes, win a few trophies, but not a trailer queen. She was built to drive and enjoy! And please keep in mind when I say new, everything was purchased new between 2008 and late 2009 when the restoration took place. Everything was new, rebuilt, or replaced during the restoration and purchased through the usual Corvette hot spots, Summit, Jegs, Corvette Central, Valley Corvette, Paragon, or a GM Dealership!", "The paint shines at any angle, with much depth and gloss. It is Goldwood Yellow base/clear PPG and at a cost of $10,000. The car has been lightly enjoyed, but still shows exceptionally well. To put it simply, its just super nice. The original factory color was Milano Maroon ( sorry to the purists out there). Undercarriage is very clean, straight, & finished in flat black with a light undercoat which is consistent with a factory application. It\u2019s not all cobbled up with Auto Zone rubberized crap! Was a body on restoration.", "It rides, drives, and handles very well; straight down the road with no shimmies, shakes, or vibrations. Extremely tight and surprisingly easy to drive for what it is. I would not hesitate to get behind the wheel of this car with my family and drive it anywhere! She cruises at 70 MPH like a new car and no joke will get 25 MPG on a trip! Please understand this beauty is not radical. She will throw you back in the seat and smoke the tires if you choose, but still cruise at 70 MPH on the highway with room on the tach and won\u2019t bend you over at the gas pump. That's the beauty of a new GM ZZ4 Crate Engine and Tremec 5 Speed. A person of any size or age could drive this vehicle comfortably despite not having power steering. All of the lights, turn signals, brakes, gauges, are functioning properly. Engine fires right up with no smoking, ticking, noises, etc. Has a fantastic rumble with the 2 \u00bd Dual Side Pipe Exhaust. Car is turnkey and ready to drive anywhere. The Black Interior is finished nicely with newly covered black bucket seats, Carpet, door panels, & arm rests.

So just picture yourself cruising down the highway in this beautiful painted red ruby, bobbing your head to the Beatles. The 327 CID V8 is the source of power behind this corvette and sends it to the ground through via it's 3-speed automatic transmission. It remains classical with the corvette styled wheels and has practically new tires to fit. Moving to the interior you will find custom made door panels the flow nicely with the black interior. The gauge cluster and dash remains original to really take you back to 1964. If you\u00c3\u00a2??re just looking for a grocery getter this car would still work great with the nice trunk space available, no reason you can\u00c3\u00a2??t look stylish picking up the eggs and milk.

If there is a car that answers all the questions of \u00c3\u00a2??is it a good investment\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d, \u00c3\u00a2??is it fun and appealing\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d, \u00c3\u00a2??will it get noticed at a car show, stop light, anywhere\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d \u00c3\u00a2??is it the best American sports car\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d?  Well here is your answer, plain and simple\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6a C2 Corvette.  This Nassau blue vette stops you in your tracks and excites every sense of your car needs.  The 327 engine is not numbers matching, but runs like a swiss clock with the recent rebuild on the transmission.  If you can\u00c3\u00a2??t see yourself in this car with the AC on with the clean white top up on the hot days and the top down on those perfect weather days, then you have never experienced the feeling of a corvette.  This is a better than average driver and not so perfect you are afraid to pull it out of your garage.  Have we said what a great Vette this is, well\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u00a6it is.  The second generation Corvette, which introduced Sting Ray to the model, continued with fiberglass body panels, and overall, was smaller than the first generation. The car was designed by Larry Shinoda with major inspiration from a previous concept design called the \"Q Corvette,\" which was created by Peter Brock and Chuck Pohlmann under the styling direction of Bill Mitchell.  Earlier, Mitchell had sponsored a car known as the \"Mitchell Sting Ray\" in 1959 because Chevrolet no longer participated in factory racing. This vehicle had the largest impact on the styling of this generation, although it had no top and did not give away what the final version of the C2 would look like.  The third inspiration was a Mako Shark Mitchell had caught while deep-sea fishing.   Production started for the 1963 model year and ended in 1967. Introducing a new name, \"Sting Ray\", the 1963 model was the first year for a Corvette coup\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 and it featured a distinctive tapering rear deck. The Sting Ray featured hidden headlamps, non-functional hood vents, and an independent rear suspension.[24] Corvette chief engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov never liked the split rear window because it blocked rear vision, but Mitchell thought it to be a key part of the entire design.  Four-wheel disc brakes were introduced in 1965. Other options available on the C2 included the Wonderbar auto-tuning AM radio, AM-FM radio, air conditioning, a telescopic steering wheel, and headrests. The Sting Ray's independent rear suspension was successfully adapted for the new-for-1965 Chevrolet Corvair, which solved the quirky handling problems of that unique rear-engine compact.  Options include: AC, power steering, wipers, horn, seat belts, gauges, AM/FM, clock, radial tires, rally wheels, convertible top, and turn signals.

The 327 CiD V8 powered Corvette fires right up and is a reliable pleasure to drive anywhere.  The 327 V8 is not original to the car but appears to be a time period correct engine.  The deep blue metallic paint is in great condition. The 4 speed manual transmission shifts smooth and the clutch feels healthy when you're banging through the gears. The rear end has retained the factory rear end gears which makes this Corvette a lot of fun to hit the streets with. The 1964 Corvette saw a few changes over the first C2 that was introduced in 1963. The ride quality was greatly improved with the swap to progressive rate front coil springs as opposed to the prior constant rate springs and the rear leaf thickness was also altered this allowed for far greater handling. Even with the changes made to the suspension for a more comfortable ride the Corvette didn't have to sacrifice its performance, this car will carve through corners like you would expect a Corvette to. The interior is in excellent condition and contrasts well against the exterior color.  The seats are comfortable and free from any tears.  The carpet, door panels, & dash follow the same level of condition.  The convertible top is in like new condition and operates easily when needed.  The bird cage on the car is rust free as with the rest of the car.  The car shows very well and really looks great out in the sunshine.  The owner just detailed this car so it is ready to get a new home and give the next owner years of memories. The owner just replaced the headlights & motors for them.   Options on this car include; Soft Convertible Top, AC (R134a system), Power steering, AM Radio, Rally Wheels with Radial Tires, Seat Belts, Vinyl Interior, and Windshield Wipers.
