of which have been fully restored back to like-new condition. \u00a0This classic also has a Magnaflow dual exhaust, an Edelbrock 600 cfm carburetor and intake, 3.00 rear gears, and fantastic documentation to show its originality. \u00a0You must see this one in person to truly appreciate it.", "100% Restored w/ Ample Documentation & Marti Report", "The current owner of this 1967 Ford Mustang GTA Hardtop purchased it back in 2008 and painstakingly restored it himself back to full factory specifications. \u00a0He informs us that he is the third lifetime owner and this beauty is in the original factory color, plus he ensured that everything on this gorgeous muscle car was 100% correct for the make/model. \u00a0It took him extensive time to track down misc. parts but the effort was well worth it- this vehicle looks as good as new and drives like a champion.", "Additionally, we have a full Marti Report to show this classic\u2019s authenticity plus ample documentation like the original window sticker, build receipts, MCA judging certificates and more. \u00a0The complete restoration was completed in 2009 and this one has been driven approximately 12,000 miles since that time, so there are only the slightest signs of wear to be found anywhere. \u00a0This 1967 Ford Mustang GTA is literally picture perfect.\u00a0", "One of the Nicest Examples You\u2019ll Find Anywhere",

one of this caliber is next to impossible and there\u2019s no way it remains available for long. \u00a0The asking price is likely too conservative for such an amazing muscle car. \u00a0For more

It has had only two owners in 50 years, the current owner possessing it for the last 18. The exterior was beautifully refinished (2000) in Dark Green that is very similar to Ford's Dark Moss Green. Stylish Mustang steel wheels, narrow whitewall tires and a classic chrome luggage rack provide nice finishing touches to the exterior. The Saddle Tan vinyl interior was restored back to original in 2000. Seats, door cards and carpeting are all well presented. A custom wood grained steering wheel replaces the original 'padded' wheel and the radio is an aftermarket AM/FM/cassette. The tan power top is in very good condition and has a tight vinyl boot. Our Mustang is powered by a 289ci small block that has been totally rebuilt. This car was a C code (289/2V) car from the factory, but we are not  sure that this is the original engine. However, knowing what we do about the history of the car, it is doubtful that the engine was ever changed. Interestingly, the transmission is a 3-speed manual with floor shift. This was the standard transmission for the '67 Mustang, but most folks who ordered a V8 usually ordered the automatic or the 4-speed manual. Brakes are standard 4-wheel drum units. This is a very nice Mustang convertible that should sell quickly. Please call 800-650-1055 or visit our website at www.autobarnclassiccars.com for additional information.

Getting its horses from a small block Ford V8 and putting power to the rear wheels thanks to a 3-speed automatic transmission, this is what pony cars are all about!

The torque thrust wheels and red stripes on the white paint really complete the look for this classy clone.The interior looks to be the original burgundy vinyl, and it has held up over the years.  No rips or discoloration can be found in the cabin, and the seats feel as comfortable as if they were new.  The music playing from the tailpipes is thrashy and staccato, like that of an 80\u00c3\u00a2??s hair metal band, yet is very welcome, given its origin.  This \u00c3\u00a2??68 Mustang truly is the complete package; all of the sounds, sights, smells, and feelings of a true GT500, but without the hefty price tag!For a real iconic heard-turner, it is hard to pass up on such a clean Mustang.

Believed to be a number matching engine and transmission which is a 351 CID Cleveland V8 and 3 speed automatic transmission. The seller did change the intake manifold and carburetor to a 4 bbl instead of 2 bbl setup for the added performance. The rest of the vehicle is believed to be restored as it came from the factory. From the Grabber Yellow paint to the 8 track tape player. The front bumper was replaced with a chrome bumper for that fresh sparkly look. The engine has a rock solid idle and accelerates smoothly without a miss. The suspension is well sorted and handles nicely without worrisome noises. The interior was also done to completely original standards and fit and finish are great. If you are a fan of early 70\u00c3\u00a2??s Mustangs then you should not pass up the opportunity on this one. The features include AM Radio with 8 Track, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Seat Belts, Vinyl Interior, Radial Tires, and Rally Wheels.

The 1986 Ford Mustang SVO took an American muscle icon and added a dose of energy pumping turbo power for a rare package that will make you realize this is a rare value-priced sleeper.  ", "  We all wanted more power in the '80s but we weren't sure if some regulations were going to outlaw our favorite cars.  Ford decided one way to approach these unsure times was with a traditional V8, and cool limited edition turbo car that was lighter but made the same power.  The guys at Ford's Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) developed this limited edition coupe that carried the Mustang's fastback style, but with some very distinctive touches.  It's instantly recognizable as a special car with features like a unique front end, offset hood scoop for the turbo's ram air, and dual rear spoilers.  All of these unique elements are present today on this fastback, and they look great against the factory-correct 2A Bright Red paint.  When these special SVO cars were new, they were about double the price of the base Mustang LX, and so you can understand that this is a rare model with only 3,382 produced in 1986.    ", "  Just like the exterior, the interior shares many premium Mustang GT elements, but has enough unique pieces for the SVO to be all its own.  It starts with the exclusive sport bucket seats with added adjustable supports, a cool SVO three-spoke steering wheel, and a Hurst short throw shifter.  Because this came at a premium price, it also came loaded with features.  This includes power windows, power locks, electric rear defrost, digital clock, and provisions for air conditioning.  There's even a newer AM/FM/CD stereo with auxiliary input to play all of your modern tunes.  It's a true driver's car.  That's why you get the full gauge pack, including large tach to make sure you can see when this turbo motor really catches its breath.  ", "  The advantage of getting a car from the SVO team meant it was built by engineers who wanted to make the best performance machine around.  That's why this special Mustang is much more than just bolting on a turbo.  We believe the 2.3-liter turbocharged, and intercooled, four-cylinder engine is original, and we know it's both smart and tough. This is a computer-controlled unit that was given beefed-up internals to handle even more boost than the engineers were dialing in.  Ford liked to tout that this turbo motor was just like a V8, and there were not far off considering this Mustang made as much horsepower as it stablemate 5.0 GT.  But what made the difference of the SVO was that it had a true European flair on the road.  That comes from features like the four-wheel disc brakes, Koni shocks, McPherson strut front suspension, and quad shock rear end.  Plus there were other great driving features such as the Borg Warner five-speed manual transmission, versatile 3.73 rear gears, and power assisted rack & pinion steering,   ", "  Complete with original title documentation, this 2nd-owner (who just rescued it out of the original owners garage) SVO remains a lot of fun, and the price for this low batch collectible can't be beat.

Historically the Ford Mustang was a real game changer in the automotive world and really took the American public by storm when it was unveiled at the New York World's Fair on April 17, 1964 and eventually became a motoring icon. Engine choices were originally a 260 Cubic Inch V8 and 170 Cubic Inch Inline 6 Cylinder but were later upgraded to the 289 and 200 which increased horsepower and got this little \"Pony\" car up to speed without hesitation.  The 289 that originally came in this little beauty has been replaced with a very peppy 351 Windsor V8 that gives a nice roar as you dice through traffic or cruise on the open highway. The shiny black exterior features American Racing wheels and is matched nicely to the black interior with bucket seats and original dash and gauges with the addition of a digital stereo by Custom Autosound and Sunpro gauges.  The classic black plastic steering wheel has been kept in place and a wood steering wheel is also included.  The windows have just the right amount of tint to keep those harmful rays out and help to give this car a sinister look on the road.  Located in our Chicago showroom, this classic 1965 Ford Mustang can be seen including an HD video and pictures at www.gatewayclassiccars.com.
