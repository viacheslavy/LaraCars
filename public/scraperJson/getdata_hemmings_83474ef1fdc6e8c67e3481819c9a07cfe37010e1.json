The car was very popular with the club sport weekend racers and autocrossers due to the small size, excellent balanced handling, and light weight body.

The original MSRP was $4399.00 with options that included; $3900 base price, $300 appearance group, $83 tinted glass, $18 center arm rest and $98 destination charge. Eve owned the car for 38 years, her name is engraved on a dash plaque that was fitted when the car was new, occasionally she autocrossed it at Bandmere Speedway in Colorado and was often the only women driver associated with the Porsche club in those days. Eve cherished the 914 and kept every single record and made detailed ownership notes, the kind of well documented history most collectors only dream about. Eve had the car refinished in the original Saturn Yellow at a cost of $4472 in December of 1992 and had an engine overhaul at a cost of $3348 in June of 1992 at around 70,000 miles. Eve's granddaughter sold the car in 2010 to a NW auto enthusiast and broker who then found another caring individual to keep it until the current owner a NW Porsche collector, purchased the car in early 2014 and he is technically the 3rd owner. The original owners book, stamped service book, window sticker, original keys, spare tire and jack are all present.", "This 914 just received a mechanical recommissioning by Authentic Motorcars consisting of a full service including fluids, spark plugs and wires, new fuel injectors, pump, and filter, fresh valve adjustment, new MP sensor, new belts, and a new battery. The shifter bushings and rods were rebuilt, motor mounts replaced, new KYB gas shocks and new rear springs installed as well as a new Sebring performance exhaust. The door seals are new and the targa top seal is in good condition and all electricals function as they should.", "Features include optional PORSCHE side graphics, front driving lamps, leather wrapped steering wheel, center console arm rest cusion, period yellow/black coco floor mats, an original Mohn accesory ski rack, and Fuchs type alloy wheels with Vredstein Sprint Classic tires. The original steel wheels with hub caps also come with the car. The interior is very clean, new carpets were fitted to freshen up the cabin, the original basket weave upholstery adores the seats and door panels, the dash is in great condition showing very little age.

Bright period colors, like this delightful Yellow, suit the car well. Our car is reported to have been purchased new by an Alaskan oil field worker, who kept the car at his Texas home. It then went to an owner in Pasadena, CA who owned the car for about five years and sold it to its most recent owner.
