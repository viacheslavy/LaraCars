With a ton invested in an original-style presentation, the right upgrades, great paperwork, and big V8 power, this is that rare showstopper you've been waiting for.", "You know this Charger looks ready for prime time in its factory-correct Monotone Burgundy Metallic.  There was definitely a nice investment to make sure this color still has a sophisticated luster.  Dodge was catching up to the new fastback craze started by the Mustang, so their historically low production numbers are especially true for the first generation that had a less than two-year production run.  But part of the reason why it was a little late to the party was because they were getting the design right.  More than just the bold roof line, this one has some very thoughtful design elements.  It starts with the bright full-width grille. The chrome side moldings start here and run continuously over the Coronet's rear kick up, and it doesn't stop until the wide rear bumper.  The result is almost like a wraparound effect of bright work.  Plus, the rear full width taillight panel is a hallmark element that we still look for today on the modern Charger.  A nice finishing touch is the set of Cragar wheels that any performance-minded would have added, too, in 1967.", "The Charger did not come cheap, and so they made sure the interior was a true premium experience.  The upholstery is quite correct and the black vinyl is offset by a few well-chosen bits of chrome and stainless trim, making for a very sleek interior that looks upscale. It also helps that they made more investments to make sure everything looks well-presented and correct.  Everyone gets the luxury of bucket seats with individuals for the rear and a fold-down armrest for the front split bench (rarely seen on this year Charger.)  Another great feature rarely seen on muscle cars are the rear seats fold individually for added versatility. The gauges are absolute works of art.  The aircraft-inspired dials have markings around the perimeter and have a very modern glow at night. An original AM radio remains in the dash, but a modern AM/FM/CD stereo head unit has been discreetly mounted in the glove box. After all, a premium cruiser like this need a good selection of tunes.", "This was born a big-block coupe, and so it's nice to see an era-correct 383 cubic-inch V8 still filling the engine bay.  It looks great with bright work on the Magnum air cleaner and valve covers.  More than just look good, this one also has some great performance chops.  It inhales deeply with an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and exhales with wicked authority out of a Flowmaster H-pipe dual exhaust. You know you have serious power any time you want it, so you'll also be glad you have power steering, power brakes, and the stout Torqueflite A727 three-speed to easily have you harness this beastly Charger.", "The sale comes complete with all the right paperwork you'd want on an interesting classic like this.  It includes the original window sticker, warranty card, title documentation, owner's manual, and restoration photos.  You don't get many opportunities to obtain such a rare and nice example of sports car history.

The brakes are completely shot and have NO stopping power. It does run and drive and I drove it onto my hauler. It has to be started by gas line running to the fuel pump from a plastic container under hood. The engine does not smoke, rattle, sneeze etc. The rear roof area is in poor shape with corrosion, rust and holes. The hood is crumpled in the middle as the P.O., upon exchange, drove it home with the hood improperly latched and it smacked back against the windshield, crumpling the hood in the middle.

You'd be very hard-pressed to find a MoPar of this era possessing anywhere near its level of road-readiness, not to mention its impressive condition.", "This is one aggressive looking muscle car - its substantial hood area and slightly inclined stance give it an almost carnivorous appearance while a sharply angled windshield and an almost fastback-like rear roofline add sleekness. It's clad in Hemi orange - a direct reference to the storied MoPar powerplant and certainly appropriate for this vintage Dodge - and looks great. Take a lap around and you won't find anything to detract from its undeniable curb appeal. The contrasting black stripe on its hood bearing its namesake Super Bee emblem, as well as another encircling the front of the cabin, both present very sharp as well. Chargers of this era had such distinctive front ends, with their wideset twin dual headlights and split front grille, and the one here is a great representative for this styling cue - it's nice and level and features unblemished chrome that really pops against the orange in back of it. This is a very well aligned car throughout - that lengthy hood lines up well with the front fenders to either side of it, and the doors open and shut easily and are surrounded by tight, uniform gaps.", "Inside the doors, the black vinyl interior has been refurbished while retaining its original configuration and is downright impressive. The bench seats in both front and back looks to have seen almost no use - there's not so much as the beginning of a crease on their surfaces. A nice dividend of the Charger's ample size comes in the form of its interior space - besides plenty of room side to side, full-size adults will have no problem getting comfortable in back. A stock Dodge steering wheel still sits on its column, while just a little further forward the dash area features easily readable gauges in its instrument cluster, as well as a straight, uncracked pad across the top. An AM radio is at the center of the dash to provide an era appropriate look, and unlike so many of its counterparts from the era, it's in good operating condition. In back, the trunk area is in great shape - the contrasting gray liner still appears fresh and the inner wheelhouses and fenders are in clear view so that you can see how clean they are.", "The 383 cubic inch V8 sitting under the hood is a correct HP2 block and it is ready for action as soon as you get this Charger home. It's carrying an Edelbrock 4-barrel carb on top and MoPar-badged valve covers on its sides, and sounds great as it exhales into a dual exhaust that features TNT mufflers. The engine teams with a 3-speed automatic 727B transmission and 3.23 rear end that were both rebuilt just a short while back, so this drivetrain is very much at the top of its game. Smooth power steering makes this sizable muscle car easy to navigate and power brakes on all four corners, with discs up front, give it plenty of dependable stopping power as it turns heads on its 15'' Rallye wheels outfitted with BF Goodrich T/A radials that have plenty of tread life still remaining.", "If you're on the hunt for a vintage Dodge with serious curb appeal and a rock-solid running condition, this 1971 Dodge Charger Super Bee is a must see.
