A first-year 1965 Ford Mustang convertible that's such a red-blooded American that it's fully red inside and out.  And because we know you want to drive it, the four-on-the-floor keeps you in complete control of the V8.  Who knew your dream could be this obtainable?  ", "  The red is a factory-correct color, and this great pony shows well in the sun.  Iconic cruisers like this always get the attention, and that's why a bright red Mustang is always in demand.  Plus, the sheetmetal must be clean and straight like it is here, because we all look for the iconic full-length scalloped design.  But more than just a nice shine, this one has added attraction from the details like the correct badging, cool chrome bumpers, and the stylish wire wheel covers.    ", "  While the white vinyl top has the crisp appearance of a recent investment, we like it even better when the roof is down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that's probably why this was order with a power top! The reason why this looks so good open to the world is because the red seats, red carpets, red door panels, and red dash all coordinate so nicely with the exterior.  There's even a red boot cover.  And everyone loves the look of the premium Pony package interior.  But as much as this classic can carry family and friends, it's really the driver who's the most important.  That's why you get that classic three-spoke sports steering wheel with the perfect thin grip.  And your right hand may never want to leave that Hurst shifter.  ", "  Under the hood are some nice upgrades like the Cobra valve covers and the bright air grabber, but there is nothing that gets in the way of the reliable power that comes from Ford's trusty 289 cubic-inch V8.  In fact, this is a true droptop for people who enjoy the feeling of the road.  So you're going to love the total control you get from the four-speed manual transmission, and your favorite soundtrack will be the growl of the dual exhaust as you shift through the optimal powerband.    ", "  A red '65 Mustang convertible is the kind of icon that gets all the right attention.  So when it looks great and is priced so right, we know you need to hurry to grab this deal.

HISTORY  The Ford Mustang was brought out five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00c2\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964\u00c2\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

While this gorgeous Ford Mustang rolls off the assembly line, trying to keep up with the demand of the public. Now recently rebuilt starting with the 289 V8, A/C, power steering, backed by an automatic transmission, digital dash, vinyl interior. Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project\u00c3\u00a2?\"supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months\u00c3\u00a2?\"while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine. It was claimed that the decision to abandon the two-seat design was in part due to the increase in sales the Thunderbird had seen when enlarged from a two-seater to a 2+2 in 1958. Thus, a four-seat car with full space for the front bucket seats, as originally planned, and a rear bench seat with significantly less space than was common at the time, were standard. A \"Fastback 2+2\", first manufactured on August 17, 1964, enclosed the trunk space under a sweeping exterior line similar to the second series Corvette Sting Ray and European sports cars such as the Jaguar E-Type coupe.Favorable publicity articles appeared in 2,600 newspapers the next morning, the day the car was \"officially\" revealed. A Mustang convertible also appeared in the James Bond film Goldfinger in September 1964To view the car in greater detail, including an HD video and 100+ HD pictures please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our Denver showroom.

After all, we bet you'd expect to pay much more for a 1965 Ford Mustang with a wild paint job, custom interior, four-on-the-floor, and an upgraded V8 under that cool Cobra Jet hood.  ", "  We could tell you this is a red-hot deal, but you already know that from the paint.  The custom flames make a bold first impression as they consume the front end and make their way down this first-year Mustang's iconic profile.  But don't let that be your only deciding factor on this coupe.  Take a look at the rest of the quality work.  For example, the gray paint that covers the rest of the car has a great metallic element and plenty of shine to make sure that the whole body looks great.  And you have great iconic details like the fog lights from the GT package, and GT wheels from the later pony cars.  And speaking of those muscle Mustangs, don't you just love how this one utilizes the Cobra Jet shaker hood?  ", "  Inside, the custom performance feeling continues with a leather bucket seat interior borrowed from a later-model Mustang.  That means you get upgraded comfort, while still getting the iconic pony embroidered on the seatback.  Plus, the cup holder center console is a great place to rest your elbow when your right hand is on the Hurst stick shift.  And your left hand is going to love the grippy Gant GT sports steering wheel.   While this has an upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo, all these performance pieces are a clear sign your favorite soundtrack will really be the rumble of the dual exhaust.  ", "  While the interior and exterior have a bold standout presence, the engine bay is all about getting down to business.  Within the black walls you can see the 289 cubic-inch motor's bold blue block radiating power.  Plus, with the fresh air topper feeding the Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, you know there's extra power coming from the V8.  You have complete control over this motor thanks to the four-speed top loader stick shift.  As you look over all the photos, you're going to spot all the right supporting components, like front disc brakes and an adjustable coilover rear suspension.  There's even a Champion aluminum radiator w/electric fan to keep this whole package running cool.  ", "  So beneath the cool custom appearance lies the right pieces for a sturdy performance machine.  It's amazing all of this can be so affordable, but you're not the only one who thinks so.  That's why you need to hurry to grab this deal.

HISTORY  The Ford Mustang was brought out five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00c2\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964\u00c2\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.
