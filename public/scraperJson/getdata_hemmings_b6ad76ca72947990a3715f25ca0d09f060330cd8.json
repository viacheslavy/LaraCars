I think not. I have traded these beautiful Cats for over four decades and I still had to force myself to put down the camera! Every angle, high and low, front and rear are beautiful lines that excite the soul. This stunning example is a one owner, four speed, a/c, wire wheel car that is as straight as these cars come. The one owner was not a restorer, or a speculator, or a concours participant, he was a man that fell in love with the XKE in 1974, bought the car and did a nice job preserving it. Consequently if you are looking for perfection or a car void of that nasty old yellow glue the survivor cars still have slopped all over them,this car is not for you. If you are looking for a well preserved car with a few minor cosmetic flaws, i.e. saggy sunvisors, choke tags, and a/c slats missing, detailed engine compartment, then you should review these pictures and contact me. The one and only owner states he never drove the car in rain or snow and the car reflects that care. I just returned from a 100 mile maiden voyage under my tutelage to a fall British car concours, the day was hot, the car ran cool with strong oil pressure. Is the car perfect? No. Is it very high in integrity? Absolutely YES! The body panels are not only straight and void of dings and dents but they also have perfect factory body panel gap and fit. The car shows no signs of accident history or rust history. Review the 59 pictures posted,if you are looking for a lovely example that is not priced in the six figure price tag,contact me at 615-971-4409. Independent inspections are welcomed and encouraged. The car is located in the Nashville TN. metro area. There will be an additional $299 assessed to final agreed upon sale price for dealer doc fees.
