The Indigo Blue already was out to attract attention, but what's really impressive is the level of care it received.  This car was built in 2006 and has less than 1,200 miles on it.

After all the pattern on the premium Carmel leather bucket seats looks and feels almost like a classic Ferrari.  The same goes for the large round speedo and tach that have their own individual pods in front of the driver.  But more than look great, this one is built to be a true track machine.  That's why you have Simpson four-point harnesses, a detachable Grant sports steering wheel, and a shifter in that perfect position for your right hand.", "While the exterior and interior have plenty of European influence, it's all American muscle under the hood.  It starts with a 400 cubic-inch V8 that has been bored .30 over.  Plus, it's been professional built by White Performance Racing with all the right components like aluminum heads, Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, Pro Comp distributor, fabricated valve covers, and long tube headers that feed the thunderous side exhaust.  A strong V8 need a strong gearbox, too, and that's why you also get a TCI Street Fighter TH400 three-speed automatic transmission.  And don't forget to check out the undercarriage photos.  There you'll see a reinforced competition chassis with all the best suspension components.  The fully independent suspension, adjustable coilovers, and four-wheel vented disc brakes are a terrific-looking package that also will also hug the road better than just about any other classic race-bred machine.", "The included build receipts document the serious investment it took to get a roadster like this.
