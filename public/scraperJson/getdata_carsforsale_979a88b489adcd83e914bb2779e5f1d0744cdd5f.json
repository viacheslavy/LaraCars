The 4th generation Impala was introduced in 1965 and set an all-time industry annual sales record of more than 1 million units in the U.S.  The new design featured curved, frameless side glass, a sharper angled windshield with newly shaped vent windows and a redesigned full coil suspension. The SS package was first introduced in 1961 and was available in both a convertible and a two door in 1965. It included Super Sport scripts on the front fenders and Impala SS signature bars on the grille and trunk lid. The 65\u2019s also included front bucket seats, an all vinyl interior, a brushed aluminum lower instrument panel with an oil / amp / temp gauge cluster, a shift trim plate and SS door emblems. This particular example is a 1 owner car with 48,279 original miles. It is completely original and numbers matching with the exception of the normal wear items. It is Danube Blue and has never been repainted. The interior is blue as well and shows incredibly well. It is nicely optioned with an AM/FM radio, tinted windows, a padded dash, power brakes, power steering and of course the SS package. The original 327 ci V8 stills purrs like a kitten and the original 2 speed power glide transmission still shifts effortlessly. It has a 12 bolt posi rear end with 3:31 gears which are perfect for the open road. Based on its original condition, low mileage and owner history we would appraise this classic at $33,990. We know that it is still a buyer\u2019s market and have priced the car accordingly. If you could see your self cruising in the timeless classic you better call us before it\u2019s too late!

So when you see the upgrades to the V8 and the drivertrain, you realize you're going to need to act quickly to grab the ultimate vintage cruiser.  ", "  While a full-size vintage convertible is always a great idea, this one seems to do it better then the rest. The '65 Impalas were redesigned to make them longer, lower, and sleeker, and the crisp lines with a kick up behind the rear door makes this downright sporty.  Bright chrome was still the American way in '65, and so it looks great with the mirror-like front bumper and grille, as well as the well-integrated rear bumper that frames the iconic triple taillight package.  Of course you can see all these details so well because of the excellent quality of the sheetmetal.  That also means a classic with a hood and trunk that line up nicely, and doors that you can shut the doors with confidence.  But what really is going to make you fall in love is the paint.  The Sea Mist Green seems to capture the era perfectly while offering a higher degree of gloss and shine from the modern application.  Plus, when you add in the Coys torque thrust style wheels (staggered 18/20-inches for an aggressive stance) and the crisp folding top, those black elements give this Impala SS all the appeal of mint chocolate.  ", "  When you take down the power folding roof, the same attraction remains, because the whole interior has a crisp black appearance.  In fact, have you spotted the green painted dash? So this convertible has an exceptionally well-coordinated package that tells people it's a thoughtful and premium classic.  And more than just appearance, there's plenty of comfort, too.  A Super Sport of this era means bucket seats and a center console.  So while there's plenty of room in the back for family and friends, you'll always be riding in individual comfort.  In fact, the driver gets the best treats as you slip behind the factory wheel with Impala center cap and gaze over the speedometer that's as wide as the horizon.  And to make sure you stay cool all year long while cruising with the top down, there's modern R134a air conditioning.  ", "  Under the hood is a correct Chevy V8 block from 1965, but you can see that there has been some nice work to it.  There's a show-worthy shine coming from elements like the Chevrolet valve covers and the air cleaner that announces this is a 327 small block.   And there's also added performance substance with upgrades such as the Edelbrock intake and Holley four-barrel carburetor.  The tidy presentation and how easily this Impala fires up leads us to believe there has been good maintenance.  Plus, the sound from the dual exhaust gives the undertones of power without being overbearing.   All of this makes you want to take this Impala out for a cruise.  That's why it also comes with the best features like power steering, four-w"], "title": "1965 Chevrolet Impala ", "total_results": "21", "price": "34995", "kilometers": 133754.561, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27676373", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "27676373", "year": "1965", "model": "Impala", "specs": {"Engine": "327 V8", "Mileage": "83,129 miles", "Exterior Color": "Sea Mist Green", "Transmission": "4 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}}
