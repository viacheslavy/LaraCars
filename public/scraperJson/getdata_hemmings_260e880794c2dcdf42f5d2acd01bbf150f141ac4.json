Each one of these classics could be considered one of the best in existence and each has a special significance in the classic car world.", "This Firebird 400 convertible is a MINT condition car no matter where you look.  It is easily a 1 condition car that has been driven, not stored, throughout its life.  The mileage is accurate at just 61500 miles.  The engine, transmission and rear end is all Original to the car.  The engine is the factory WU code 400ci engine with 325hp and factory four speed transmission. The Air Induction Hood was included with the WU code engine package.  The compression ratio is a powerful 10.75:1, the highest available in a Pontiac that year and one of the highest ever!

There were 82,560 Firebirds produced for its first year in 1967.  Only 15,528 were convertibles and just 1220 had this engine option.  We Do NOT know the number convertibles with this engine option but if you take the percentage of convertibles produced to the number of hardtops, that is less than 20%.  If only 20% of the 1220 400ci engines made were convertibles, that would mean that just 244 convertibles had this engine option.  Lets add one more thing to the mix!  Of the 244 convertibles with this engine option, how many were 4 speeds??  Ill bet there werent more than 100 produced.  Now, how many still exist??  Well, try and find one!  \u2026and in FLAWLESS condition such as this?  We did do a bit of speculating here but we cant be too far off if at all.  If anything, we may even be underestimating\u2026  and If you need one more factor to add to the absolute rarity of this Bird, include the factory hood tachometer.  Keep in mind, nothing was added to this car.  This is exactly how it left the factory.  This car is truely the best of the best!!", "Other options include power steering, power front disc brakes, power windows, center console, Rally II wheels, hood mounted tachometer, folding rear seat (a rare option) and AM radio which has been upgraded to a AM-FM stereo with the vintage look and modern inner parts.  Take a look at the photos.  Every single thing including the clock works perfectly.", "The car starts, drives and stops flawlessly period.  It is extremely powerful as well.  There are literally No Disappointments here!  This car was featured in a Muscle Car book called Firebird / Trans Am written by David Newhardt in 2005.  The book will come with the car.  Documentation includes a previous owners Nebraska title, PHS and the original owners manual.  This is a must have for any Pontiac collector or enthusiast alike.", "NOTE; Hemmings limits the number of photos allowed to 50.
