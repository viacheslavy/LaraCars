But as you look at the total package \u2013 everything from the glittering chrome to the 400 hp V8 under the hood \u2013 you realize this is a turn-key classic for the enthusiast who likes to get noticed everywhere.", "This is the kind of story we want any classic pickup to have.  This Chevy was bought new less than an hour from our showroom, and it was traded for a horse!  The consignor actually bought it as a barn find from the first owner and turned the original patina'd paint and body into a very cool custom.  The patina blue is a truly unique feature.  The different shades seen throughout this pickup make it look like there's a tidal wave rolling over the whole body.  Another reason why this worn-in paint looks so good is the exceptionally straight sheetmetal.  It means the light rolls evenly from panel to panel and really revels the depth of the full-body patina.  But what's really catching the sunlight is all that brightwork.  The chrome is glittering from new pieces like the bumpers and grille.  And of course, everyone sees the shine of the modern REV alloys with 18/20-inch front/rear offset disguised under the lowered suspension.  But it's not just the modern pieces that grab attention.  We all love details like the sun visor, real wood in the truck bed, and the ultra-desirable five-window cab.  So in total, the whole appearance defines aggressively elegant.", "The interior gives a first impression of a tough working-class pickup, and that never goes out of style.  The fresh bench seat, old-school heater, and large three-spoke factory wheel are all part of the vintage truck experience.  But then you spot elements like the Lokar floor shifter and auxiliary gauge trio.  These let you know there's something special in the engine bay even before you twist the key.", "One look under the hood, and you can tell this is a very mean machine... but there still is some room for some classic pickup style.  For example, while this has a sinisterly dark valve covers and air topper with the glowing red Chevy script on top, there's also the Dr. Pepper radiator overflow bottle as a cool nod to this 3100's country roots.  The 355 cubic-inch V8 is a serious performance-built motor that includes upgrades like an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and Performer EPS intake.  It's a total package rated at 400 hp, and the thunder of the dual exhaust lets everyone know its power superiority.  A big V8 machine needs the right supporting components, too, so the stout three-speed automatic transmission now has a 3,200 stall to keep you in the optimal power band.  Plus, the front suspension has been upgraded to an independent unit borrowed from an S-10 truck.  The rear is now a strong four-link with coilovers.  Add in more great driving features like power steering, front disc brakes, and modern performance tires, and you have a classic patina'd pickup that can make some serious moves on the streets.", "Complete with owner's manual, you're looking at big power in a very cool package.

The Woody engine was great and had very few miles, so in it went. We installed power steering, this will really make this a great driver. We also installed new 15 inch 5 spoke American Racing wheels and wide white radial tires. It really looks good in red with the extra chrome trim on the fenders and sun visor. We installed a brand-new chrome grill as the old one, even though it looked good, had some chrome blemishes. I think you will really like this panel. It also has a brand-new interior. The rear is finished also. Has the original wood bed in the rear. Electric wipers. Has a trap door on the right side for the gas filler. It does not have a radio but the hole is there in the dash. It's wired with 4 speakers in the back. Tilt column. The worst thing we found (and it's not much) is the left rear door sill has a minor spot of rust. We did not find any rust holes on the underside. Very solid. What a difference driving before and after power steering was added. So far I have driven the panel about 85 miles, mostly freeway.

There was a time when any farm had one of these rusting away behind a barn or still working out in the fields, but today, they are highly sought collector's items. Hailing from a dry climate, this very solid pickup features a very correct restoration with some smart upgrades that make it a fine piece that you can show and drive with confidence.", "Refinished in what I would certainly call Fathom Green, this truck looks highly authentic sitting on the blackwall tires with painted steel wheels and hubcaps. The Advance Design trucks debuted in 1948, the first post-war trucks to hit the market, and they were a huge success. The bodywork on this one has been well executed with good panel fit and alignment, and signs that a considerable amount of time was spent getting everything straight before the paint was sprayed. The finish is appropriate and looks great on this vintage hauler. The bed has been refinished with fresh oak planks and stainless steel strips and looks absolutely gorgeous. Up front, there's a painted grille, which was standard equipment on the 3100, and the chrome bumpers were options that were available from the dealer. A single tail lamp was also standard equipment, but this one sports a proper pair for highway safety in today's driving environment.", "Utilitarian is the best way to describe the interior of the 3100. As I said, these were tools, not daily drivers, so while they are comfortable, they're also spartan, which is part of their charm. The brown bench seat sports a recent seat cover, the door panels are simple vinyl inserts, and the headliner is just basic fabric stretched over the steel body skin. The dash, however, is very similar to those in Chevy cars of the period, and there's a complete array of gauges keeping an eye on the Stovebolt under the hood. Painted a contrasting tan, the interior panels brighten the inside of the truck, and the chrome brightwork on the dash and glove box door really helps it feel more upscale. And yes, that's correct, this one sports a well-integrated Vintage Air A/C system and turn signals, making it a truck you can happily use every day.", "If you do choose to use it daily, however, you'll have to content yourself with a leisurely pace. The 216 cubic inch inline-six under the hood is as tough and reliable as an anvil, but these trucks were never built for speed. The engine itself has been rebuilt, and bathed in the correct shade of gray with a minimum of ornamentation. The single barrel carburetor is topped by a compact oil bath air cleaner, and exhaust is handled by a single tailpipe that gives the truck its distinctive sound. Upgrades include the aforementioned A/C system as well as an alternator and an electric fan to keep it cool. The transmission is a 3-speed manual that shifts with your fingertips. It rides on the original suspension, although it has been upgraded with tubular shocks front and rear to help smooth out the ride. As I mentioned earlier, the wheels are steel and wear modern 235/75/15 blackwall radials that still look very authentic.", "You almost want to paint a logo on the doors and head into town to do some business when you own a truck like this. With a host of smart upgrades, it's far less crude than it was sixty years ago, something you'll appreciate every time you climb behind the wheel. Two years from now, this price will probably seem like a bargain. Call now!"], "Exterior:": "Green", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "1362"}},

The fuel tank has been relocated to the rear to create more room inside the cab. Under the hood you will see that there has been a complete overhaul of the chassis and drivetrain with a 6.0L engine and 4L60E transmission installed out of a low mileage 2008 Tahoe.  There is a polished Performance Rod and Custom Aluminum radiator with electric temperature controlled fans. The chrome Vintage A.C. compressor has been relocated to the top of the motor for clearance. The Headers on the truck are aluminum coated shorty headers. The front and rear suspension are out of a corvette with power rack and pinon steering with drilled and slotted rotors and painted red calipers. The wheels are a set of OEM Corvette C5 wheels not cheap reproductions. On the interior this truck has an Ididit steering column, Classic Industries Gauges, Lokar shifter, power leather seats, custom built center console with cup holders, and a set of power windows that retain the original style handles. There has been a large sum of money and time spent on this truck. It has been setup to drive and enjoy and should not be mistaken for your run of the mill rat rod.
