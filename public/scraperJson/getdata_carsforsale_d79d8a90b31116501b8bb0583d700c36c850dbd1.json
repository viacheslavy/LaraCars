This incredibly well done restoration was completed by a local mechanic that found the car in a barn while provided a mobile service for a collector client .  The car was originally a California titled car and was brought to Texas in 2008.  It was worked on for several years slowly before the previous owner gave up and let the car sit idle for 6 years. Then the current owner came across it in a barn.  He purchased the car in 2015 in Houston and did a frame off restoration.  They reconditioned & refinished almost every bolt on the car.  For any car collector looking for one for his collection would be lucky to be able to get one that looks the way it does. The 3-liter inline 6 cylinder engine was rebuilt. It received all new bearing & rings,the cam shaft & lifters were replaced, new timing chain was added and all the gaskets and seals were replaced, including all freeze plugs.  The cylinder head got reworked including new style valve stem seals.  The SU carbs were rebuilt and everything was painted correctly. The motor sounds perfect & does not smoke at all.  It pulls strong through the whole RPM range. The owner replaced the solenoid for the electric overdrive and the sycrnos are in good shape. It shifts smoothly through-out all the gears and the overdrive works perfectly. The engine bay was painted black while the chassis and frame were all coated with Por-15, a super heavy duty rust inhibitor that\u00c3\u00a2??s been trusted for years. Each panel was sanded down and primed. Then the car was put back together with all the parts in primer and more bodywork was done. Then each panel was painted and the car was finished off. Everything in the interior was replaced except the seats and the console which had already recovered.  Moss Motors supplied a complete kit with door panels and new carpet including the trunk carpet. The car also has brand new chrome wire wheel.  The car runs and drives perfectly and everything works & as it should.  This car was built to be a driver, not just a trailer queen. With that in mind some modifications have been made. It has a modern charging system so the generator and regulator have been replaced by an alternator. It has an aftermarket Pertronics distributor so the points have been eliminated. It also has a modern radio with bluetooth.  It now also has a 12-volt negative ground electrical system.  The restoration took almost a year and was documented along the way. Photos of the project can be provided. Also available is a stack of receipts; which total about 20K in parts alone.   It\u00c3\u00a2??s been driven just under 300 miles since it was completed in Dec 2016. The car needs nothing to be complete. Don't miss your chance to take this beautiful classic home.

In early 1961, the 3000 was upgraded to Mark II form, which meant little more than a new grille and a revised 29E engine with three carburetors and was carried over into the 1962 model. The 29E engine in the Austin-Healey 3000 Mark II was still 2,912 cc (178 CID), but it had a hotter cam and a new intake manifold with three 1.5\" (38mm) S.U. HS4 carburetors, giving it 132 hp and 167 ft./lbs. of torque. The Austin-Healey 3000 again offered two-seat (BN7) and 2+2 (BT7) body styles with this one being a BT7 model. The rear panel of the BT7 was cut out much deeper towards the trunk to make room for the small jumper seats in the rear. This 1962 Austin Healey 3000 Mark II for sale is powered by its original 2,912cc, Tri-Carb Inline 6 cylinder engine and is backed by a 4-speed manual transmission with overdrive. This car has been nicely restored with the body being painted in a classy two-tone black and gold exterior color and is outfitted nicely with a black leather interior and black convertible top. Options on this 1962 Austin Healey 3000 Mark II include: Manual Convertible Top, Telescopic Wheel, Seat Belts, Leather Interior and Radial Tires wrapped around Wire Wheels.  The Austin Healey 3000 is one of the most collectible and sought after British roadsters and this one is as clean as they come. Values on these classic Austin Healeys have continued to climb making this collectible a solid investment. This classic roadster is perfect for long tours and will show well at the local car show. This 1962 Austin Healey 3000 Mark II for sale is located in our Indianapolis Showroom and can be seen in greater detail, including a High Def video at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.
