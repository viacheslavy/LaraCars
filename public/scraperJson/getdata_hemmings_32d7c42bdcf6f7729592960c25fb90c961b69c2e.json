It has just over 60,000 original miles. I purchased this one from a local long time collector who is retiring to Florida. He was the third owner and had it in his collection for some 30 years. He's a cool guy, I will furnish his contact information to the buyer.", "The body is in remarkable condition with virtually no rust. There is no rust in the frame and the floors and underpinnings are very good for a car this age. The doors open and close beautifully and all panels are FACTORY STRAIGHT. The finish looks show winning until you get up close. Portions of the paint appear to be original. The \"Korean era\" chrome is original and showing its age. The interior is all original with the exception of the rugs, and is still serviceable. I have many additional photos and video available upon request. I would rate this car as a good, mellow driver. If you want to hang with the \"trophy set\" this isn't the car for you.", "The car needed very little to be put into reliable roadworthy condition; new brakes, radial tires, grease fittings and some carburetor work. The previous owner recently had the transmission rebuilt, and he also installed an electric fuel pump which I left in place. The car starts every time - hot or cold. The brake pedal is nice and high and the steering is smooth, and though the engine has low compression in one cylinder (about 60 lbs.), it still delivers good power and runs nicely. In spite of this, the old Cadillac is still a pleasure to drive, (on the highways the car does well in the left lane). The \"Autronic Eye\" has been disconnected and as a result only the high beams work (which I angled down slightly). The power windows and seat work nicely. The turn signals, horn and brake lights work fine, as do the dash, glove box, and courtesy lights. The heater is nice although the missing control valve has been by-passed. The radio lights up, but doesn't work. I may try to replace the vibrator (extra one included) if I have the time. The wipers are slow and need new blades. All locks are working fine with the correct keys. In short, this car is ready to enjoy now.", "If you have owned many collector or antique vehicles this age, you know how troublesome a poorly done or misrepresented piece can be to drive and maintain. As is often the case, shoddy work done by ignorant or back yard mechanics can make a \"restored\" car a miserable experience to own. Disgusted owners sell them for a fraction of the money invested. That is not the case here. I don't think you'll find a sweeter old fishtail Cadillac anywhere for the money. Please see my satisfaction guarantee below and remember I have additional photos and supporting video. Please call me for further details at 973-366-5853 between 9:00AM and 9:00 PM. You can also check my reputation by looking at my feedback or by typing in \"The Golden Gup\" on any search window.", "I'm a mobile DJ by trade but I love old Cadillacs! In my 45 years of driving, I've probably owned over a hundred of them. I'm a hobbyist, I like to buy them, fix 'em up, find them a new happy home, then go out and get another (at this point, I'd like to find a classic touring sedan or limo from the late 30's)."], "Exterior:": "Black", "Condition:": "Good", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "60500"}}
