But if you want one with a manual transmission, well, that narrows it down to this Euro-spec 1985 Mercedes-Benz 280SL. With all the same style and reliability that made these cars famous, plus a unique look and a sweet 5-speed gearbox, this might be the one to own if you're a guy who loves to drive.  ", "  For years, the Europeans kept all the good stuff for themselves. US regulations gave us big, heavy rubber bumpers and antiquated headlights, but in Europe, the SL was wearing svelte chrome-rimmed bumpers and halogen headlights that totally transformed the R107's look. This bright white 280SL is an ideal example of the undiluted look that Americans never see and it stands out in a big way, even today. Looking vastly more modern than its thirty years would suggest, it shows the same fantastic build quality for which these cars are famous, as well as careful maintenance that has kept it in top condition. The paint has a wonderful luster that definitely suggests great wealth, and while it shows some signs of age, it remains the kind of car that gets attention everywhere it goes. Yes, the Euro bumpers are excellent, the headlights are clear, and the rest of the trim is in first-rate condition, although the gold-plated grille was probably added after it arrived on our shores.  ", "  It also includes a black MB-Tex interior, which is original and shows just how durable the Mercedes upholstery really is. Contrasting perfectly with the white paint, it's elegant and sporty, just like the rest of the car, and especially well preserved. Sure, it's a little odd to see a 5-speed manual shifter sticking out of the console and three pedals on the floor, but otherwise it's a traditional SL with a no-nonsense dashboard and that intangible feeling of quality throughout. The instruments all work properly, and this one is loaded with features like A/C, power windows, and real wood trim, just as you'd expect from the top-of-the-line Mercedes. The seats are in excellent shape with just gentle comfort marks on their faces, the dash is unaffected by UV rays, and the door panels and rear package shelf are nearly new. The original radio is gone, replaced by an AM/FM/CD stereo head unit that sounds great and about the only complaint we have is that the odometer seems to have stopped working at some point, so we don't know the mileage. A black canvas convertible top stows under a hard rear tonneau, and a removable hardtop was standard equipment.   ", "  Despite giving up some displacement to the usual V8-powered SLs, the 2.8 liter DOHC inline six does a fantastic job of moving the roadster when linked to a 5-speed gearbox. The engine bay is neatly finished, and you'll note a refreshing lack of pesky emissions equipment to get in your way, all due to the European specifications. Recent work includes a new fuel pump and accumulator, a clean gas tank, and the usual plugs, wires, and ignition parts, "], "title": "1985 Mercedes-Benz 280-Class ", "total_results": "4644", "price": "12995", "kilometers": 25555.747, "total_pages": 195, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29663926", "brand": "Mercedes-Benz", "reference_id": "29663926", "year": "1985", "model": "280-Class", "specs": {"Engine": "2.8 I6", "Mileage": "15,883 miles", "Exterior Color": "White", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

The turbocharged 3.8 L became standard and was refined with sequential fuel injection, distributor-less computer controlled ignition, and boasted 200 hp (150 kW) at 4400 rpm and 300 lb\u00b7ft (407 N\u00b7m) of torque at 2400 rpm. Only 5,204 Turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year production of the computer controlled Sequential Fuel Injection and Distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year/model that started the development of the legendary intercooled Grand Nationals. The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the \u201cLittle V6\u201d easily kept up with the bigger V8\u2019s. Quarter mile (~400 m) performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of 10 psi (0.69 bar), while for the same year, the Chevrolet Camaro was listed at 17.0 and the Chevrolet Corvette at 15.2 seconds.  Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. All Grand Nationals for this year had the Lear Siegler-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the T-Top option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals"], "title": "1984 Buick Regal ", "total_results": "4644", "price": "14900", "kilometers": 63491.14, "total_pages": 195, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27977255", "brand": "Buick", "reference_id": "27977255", "year": "1984", "model": "Regal", "specs": {"Engine": "3.8L V6 Turbo", "Mileage": "39,460 miles", "Exterior Color": "Black", "Transmission": "Automatic 4-Speed", "Interior Color": "Gray", "Drive Train": "RWD", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

It combines a great-running small block V8 with plenty of style and a touch of practicality to make a car that you'll never get tired of driving and looks far more expensive than it is.  ", "  The original color was code 55 Champagne Gold, but at some point this car got a makeover in handsome Burgundy livery, which seems to suit it just fine. A cowl induction hood, black SS stripes, and exceptionally tight gaps are the kinds of things that car guys notice and appreciate, and at this price it looks decent and has an elegant look that's missing on a lot of Elkys. No, it's not perfect and it's been driven and used, but there's no denying the appeal. The bed has been coated with a spray-in bedliner that makes it practical and durable for the things you want to do with a pickup truck, so this truck/car should be an easy sell to your significant other, too. Proper SS badges, a blacked-out grille, and hood pins reinforce the muscle car part of the Elky's DNA, and the whole thing has an appealing look. Even the black vinyl top helps make it look elegant in a way that makes it seem as though other El Caminos are under-dressed.   ", "  Black cloth and vinyl upholstery is a nice upgrade from plain vinyl and bucket seats with a console are always a great choice in an El Camino. From behind the wheel, it's almost impossible to tell that you're not in a Chevelle, with a four-spoke Grant GT steering wheel, driver-oriented dashboard, and the view over that cowl-induction hood. Instrumentation is SS-spec, with a full complement of dials that include a factory tach and a vacuum gauge down on the console. An AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit, factory A/C, and a tilt steering column also make this a great car for road trips or even just a trip down to the local cruise night, where it's sure to be a hit.  ", "  A smart-running 400 cubic inch small block V8 lives under that cowl-induction hood and makes this El Camino feel every bit as muscular as it looks. A few dress-up pieces make it look good, including a chrome air cleaner and Z/28-sytle finned valve covers. There's obviously a lot of recent work under the hood, including new belts and hoses, a recent alternator, and some fresh wiring. The dual exhaust system uses ubiquitous Flowmaster mufflers, so it has that traditional muscle car sound that everyone wants. A rugged TH400 3-speed automatic transmission feeds a 12-bolt rear end ignores abuse and is filled with highway-friendly, so it's an easy cruiser. You'll note that the floors are clean, there are a lot of new front-end components, and long-tube headers feed a new Flowmaster dual exhaust system. Flashy Rally wheels with spinners look great on the El Camino and carry staggered 215/70/15 front and 225/70/15 rear Goodyear radials that fit inside the wheel wells just right.

This model year also added a glove box, new armrests, new inner door panels, a redesigned speedometer and tach, and wiper and washer controls were moved back to the instrument panel.

These cars have a huge following all the way in to the new models of today.  I can remember as a kid going to road coarse races in Missouri and seeing these right hand drive cars all over the race track because of how well you could get in to the turns with them.  This one is a fine example of what I remember.  The blue and white paint is only a couple years old and presents very well.  The fit and finish on the car is in great shape, and as you will see in the pics and the video, you could shave in the bright work.    These cars just make you laugh because they are so cool that you just have to drive one.  You wouldn't think that anyone over the height of 5 foot could fit in one, but some of us here are 6'4 and fit in it just fine.  So open up the right side (yes it is right hand drive) door and slide on it and get ready to have a ton of fun.  As you look around the interior you are going to see that things are pretty basic which is what these cars always were.  There are no rips in the seats, dash, headliner, or carpet.  There have been a set of fog lights installed for that extra racing look as well as an am/fm/cd player so you can cruise around with all of your cool tunes as well.  We know that you already have that ear to ear grin on your face and you haven't even started this car up yet.    So, you go ahead and turn the key and fire up the 1000 CC motor under the hood and you hear it come to life.  You chuckle a little more because you are getting ready to have a lot of fun.  We are not talking about the 500 to 800 HP kind of fun.  This kind of fun is handling like almost nothing you have ever driven.  These cars weigh just a little over 1500 pounds so there is nothing to them.  They are still one of the most nimble cars on the road today.  So you put your foot on the clutch and throw this thing in to first and get ready to ride.  Now that you understand what a mini is all about, you don't want to get out.  You are like the kid at the go kart track that just wants to keep going and going.  That is why you need to have this cool ride in your garage today.    We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms and allow you to pay your baby off when you want to without any prepayment penalties.  We look forward to speaking with you soon and we look forward to making you the newest member of the Just Toys Classic Cars family.
