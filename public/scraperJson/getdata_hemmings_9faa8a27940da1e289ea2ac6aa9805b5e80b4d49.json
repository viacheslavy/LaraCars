The clean bright white is a more modern application from a few years ago, so it has an upgraded gloss that's just perfect for sunny day trips.  And adding to this bright attitude are mirror-like bumpers that definitely were given an investment, too.  The brightwork enhancements that have gone into this convertible also enhanced the sporty attitude, including the Cragar wheels and long dual exhaust tips. And the black triple-rocker stripe adds to this performance feeling, too, while also coordinating with the new black vinyl top.", "And if you like the way the black top looks, with just the flip of a switch, the power folding roof goes down to reveal an equally impressive black interior.  That's because the rocker stripe matching the boot cover as well as the entire inside of this car give this one a terrific coordinating effect.  This car's sporty attitude continues with the bucket seats. Plus, you get a three-spoke sports steering wheel with Mustang center cap, and beyond that is the full factory gauge package with everything working correctly.  And we all know you'll love resting your right hand on the Hurst shifter.  And while the full presentation looks factory-correct, you'll spot subtle upgrades like the retro-style radio that's an AM/FM with a digital tuner.  Best of all, you can enjoy the drop top driving experience well into the summer season with air conditioning that's blowing cold from modern R134a.", "This is a C-code Mustang, so it's great to see a proper 289 cubic-inch V8 under the hood.  They even painted the air topper and valve covers to match the exterior white to give the engine bay a unique flair.  More than just look nice, this has been given the right maintenance, including recent investments in new components like the water pump, battery, spark plugs, and starter.  This is a driver's machine, and so you get true control in this convertible thanks to the four-speed manual transmission, front disc brakes w/ 4 piston calipers, and Uniroyal Tiger Paw tires.", "Complete with owner's manual and maintenance records, this is everything you love about the first-year Mustang droptop.

Fast forward more than a half a century, and this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible continues to represent its model in stellar fashion, featuring a great looking color and a substantial list of updated stock parts that increase its reliability factor for frequent driving.", "A legion of Mustangs graced the pages of display ads clad in light blue paint, and the shade you see here is actually a slightly deeper and more modern interpretation of the original, coming from the line of Ford's '92 color offerings. It's a great accompaniment to the Mustang's timeless form, looking sporty and solid underneath a nice clearcoat. That form itself looks well-aligned and road-ready, with flush fitting body panels showing nice even gaps between them, and doors and hood that open and shut smoothly. The entire exterior cuts a sharp appearance - once behind the wheel you'll be gazing through a very clear windshield, the bumpers both fore and aft sit nice and level, sporting very clean chrome, and the trim throughout is intact and straight. While there's no doubt that this classic beckons you to climb in and hit the road for some open-air motoring, should the skies darken during your outing, the power white convertible top raises into place very smoothly, and features new hydraulic cylinders and hoses to keep it doing so in the future.", "The interior sports an inspired color scheme on top of an almost entirely stock configuration, with the two-tone, blue and white pattern carried on its deluxe Pony buckets in front and bench seat in back mirrored by the door panels and dash area surrounding the instrument cluster and glove box. When you look just past the stylish stock white steering wheel and matching column, you'll see that the cluster now features a full assortment of Dakota digital gauges that fit perfectly within its confines and have an appealing blue glow. Just below, the underdash air conditioning system sits ready to keep you and your passengers comfortable. Many of the components you see inside, including the seat covers, dash pad and door panels, have been updated to a very fresh condition, and weatherstripping has been installed to keep the elements out so that they'll stay that way. The trunk area in back is lined with signature Ford plaid, with a full-size spare showing plenty of tread stowed off to the side.", "This drop top is outfitted with a 289-cubic inch V8 that starts strong, runs with confidence-inspiring smoothness and is bolted to a 3-speed automatic C4 transmission that's also in fine form and known for its durability. Combine factory power steering with power disc brakes at all four corners that offer far superior fade resistance over their original drum counterparts in more demanding driving conditions, and you have a vintage Mustang with road manners to match its great looks. This very sharp looking Ford classic sits on a set of 16'' American Racing wheels that are wrapped with BF Goodrich G Force Sport tires.", "If you're looking for an open-air classic that's fully prepared to hit the road as soon as you get it home, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible.

In-between is a modern center console with comfy armrest and cup holders.  The radio looks like a factory piece, but it's upgraded retrosound unit with a digital tuner and an aux input for the most modern music players.  The three-spoke steering wheel gives you that classic grippy feeling you expect from a Mustang, but beyond that, a crisp set of TPI gauges keep you better informed than the factory setup ever did.  But your favorite upgrade will likely be the R134a air conditioning.  After all, that will keep you feeling as cool as you look.", "Under the hood, the 289 cubic-inch V8 looks great with its bright air topper and ribbed Mustang valve covers.  This motor inhales deeply from an Edelbrock four-barrel, which give it a more modern carb while still staying true to its A-code nature.  The belts, wires, and hoses tell you this is a nicely maintained engine bay, and the sound of the dual exhaust reminds you why a V8 Mustang is always in demand.  Plus, this one has some great anytime driving features like the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes.", "Complete with owner's manual, here's an icon with all the right upgrades.
