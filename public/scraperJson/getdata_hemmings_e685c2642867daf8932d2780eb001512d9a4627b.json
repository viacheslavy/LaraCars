LE1416-9", "Old English White with Red Leather Interior", "While Jaguar captured headlines and hearts with their extraordinarily competent sports and racing car offerings in the 1950s  their bread and butter was always saloon cars. The iconic \u201cgrace  space  and pace\u201d tagline was genuinely appropriate. Not only were their sedans elegant and luxurious  they featured Jaguar's innovative twin-cam engine  disc brakes  and genuinely world class suspension engineering that incorporated lessons from winning a continuous stream of world sports car championships. Jaguar took this philosophy further by introducing what is arguably one of the world's first sports sedans. Initially called the 2.4 Litre and 3.4 Litre  the model was retroactively referred to as the Mark 1 when the Mark 2 emerged in 1959. Both cars were smaller than the Mark VII to Mark IX full size sedans then available  yet they were available with the largest XK engines then produced  the 3.4 liter and later the 3.8. This \u201cbig motor in a small car\u201d philosophy made the Mark 1 and 2 a genuinely high performance car of any type  let alone a sedan  and the cars were very successful in motorsport  winning rallies and touring car championships driven by famed drivers like Mike Hawthorn  Roy Salvadori  and Stirling Moss.", "This handsome Mark II is an original 3.8 liter car  still retaining its matching-numbers engine and cylinder head. The car has been the subject of a detailed and documented restoration  supported by a substantial 3 inch thick binder of invoices documenting the extensive mechanical and cosmetic restoration performed in 2010 with additional improvements in 2016 and 2017. Ownership documents date back to the prior owner's purchase in 1993  including registration receipts and records for service. In 2010 Vintage Autoworks in Tucker  GA began the restoration process focusing on extensive mechanical work documented in records included with the car.  Work included a comprehensive engine rebuild including line honing the doweled main caps and all cylinders  resizing pistons  crankshaft regrind  resurfacing the flywheel  adjusting valves  checking all clearances  and final reassembly using correct finishes  hoses  and hardware. All new hardware and correct replacement bolts and fittings were used throughout the engine and underhood restoration. Engine machining work alone was over $3 700. A 12 blade fan  new aluminum radiator  new carburetors  and new exhaust were also fitted. The owner elected to upgrade the brakes using new 4-piston brakes and calipers at the front  with new mounting adapter plates  fresh hardware  new hard lines  soft lines  and pads. The fuel system was also restored as needed  including all new fuel lines  a new fuel pump  tank cleaning  and new tank mounts. A new steering rack and various relevant front steering and suspension parts were also installed along with a properly sectioned lower steering column  cut to improve fit and steering performance. While the mechanical work was completed  the car was also prepared for a comprehensive interior restoration  including new front and rear seat covers  new Wilton Wool carpet set  underfelt kit  and sound insulating Dynamat. Even the front and rear door panels were properly sourced using stitch-only details instead of heat pressing. Underdash panels  side trim panels  and A-post panels were replaced using high quality materials and proper fasteners.", "In 2016 and 2017  Classic Coachworks  Monterey  CA was commissioned to service the car's mechanical systems.  Work at this time included rebuilding the carburetors and throttle linkage as well as installing an inline fuel filter  rebuilding the speedometer  installing a new differential pinion seal and rear housing gasket  and a new neutral safety switch. A new electronic ignition system was installed in 2016 along with a complete review of the electrical system and replacement of all bulbs  with repairs performed as needed. The brakes were inspected and some new hoses installed  in addition to a new brake booster and servo. A new alternator  fan belt tensioner  and various other detail items were also addressed. A set of period-type front and rear seatbelts were installed  safely anchored to proper floor points. Later that year  the transmission was removed and a new torque converter installed with proper modifications made to the transmission mounts and driveshaft. In total over $12 000 has been spent in the past year and a half to address mechanical systems  instruments  and electrical system.", "Today  the car presents in essentially show-ready condition  retaining a factory stock appearance highlighted by beautiful paint and chrome. The paint is excellent  with high gloss and no significant chips or scratches of note and is applied to an exceptionally straight body that displays very good panel fit and smooth operation when opening and closing all four doors  hood  and trunk. Beautifully contrasted by gorgeous chrome plated wire wheels with eared knockoffs  the elegant Old English White paint and black-wall Vredestein tires give this saloon a very sporting appearance. The exterior trim  lenses  and glass are all in equally nice condition including a beautiful grille and leaper mascot and excellent chrome plating throughout.", "The interior is very well presented  with the leather seating remaining supple  vibrant in color  evenly finished  and very well matched throughout the interior. The Wilton carpeting is in very nice condition as are the floor mats  door panels  and headliner. The wood throughout the car presents beautifully  with clear  glossy varnish  mellowing lightly in a few small areas. The instruments and switches are excellent throughout and correct in appearance  with the entire dashboard presenting very cohesively. The factory correct gloss black steering wheel and chrome plated horn ring are in place and in excellent order. Behind the front seats  quintessentially British hinged picnic trays are nicely covered in matching leather on the backs and trimmed with glossy lacquered wood finishes on the dining surfaces. Front and rear matching red seat belts and plated hardware complete the interior.", "The engine compartment is clean and well-detailed  having been nicely finished with beautifully polished aluminum engine components  proper fasteners and hardware  correct hoses  proper induction plenum  and a very nicely chrome plated twin snorkle air cleaner. Both the cylinder head and the engine block numbers match  making this a correct 3.8 liter saloon just as it left the factory. The trunk is stock in appearance with nice paint to the metal on the inside surfaces and spare tire well  which houses a full sized matching wire wheel. The undercarriage is exceptionally solid and clean  showing proper care and cleanliness consistent with the presentation of the entire car.", "Behind the wheel  one is struck by what a revelation this car must have been when new. An elegant car aesthetically  the driving position is both commanding and comfortable while the packaging feels just right: comfortable but also easy to place on the road and genuinely enjoyable when driving with purpose. The engine is well-tuned and exhibits good power. The automatic transmission shifts smoothly when warm. The updated brakes are effective but also well matched with the rest of the controls and systems. The recently replaced steering is direct and precise  benefiting from recent tires and suspension service. The chassis has a solid feel and the suspension offers a gratifying combination of comfort and control. The car comes with extensive service records and documentation relating to the restoration spanning 25 years as well as the owner's manual.", "This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire an authentic matching numbers 3.8 liter Mark II featuring extensive and well-executed improvements and beautiful presentation. With thousands of dollars recently spent sorting out cosmetic and mechanical details to a high standard  this fine Mark II is poised to act as a rewarding show car or a stunning driver in which to cover miles and miles of pleasurable driving."], "Mileage:": "71093"}},
