"mileage": "87538", "description": ["Worldwide Vintage Autos is pleased to present this 1968 Ford Bronco.   HISTORY  The original Bronco was an ORV (Off-Road Vehicle), intended to compete primarily with Jeep CJ models and the International Harvester Scout. The Bronco's small size riding on a 92-inch (2,337 mm) wheelbase made it maneuverable for some uses, but impractical as a tow vehicle. The Bronco was Ford's first compact SUV.  The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey, who also conceived the Ford Mustang; and similarly, Lee Iacocca pushed the idea through into production. In many ways, the Bronco was a more original concept than the Mustang; whereas the Mustang was based upon the Ford Falcon, the Bronco had a frame, suspension, and a body that were not shared with any other vehicle.

Black on Red are the original colors.    Interior is all original, but the truck was resprayed 1 time.  We do have a signed affidavit from the previous owner stating the miles are original.  This has some rare items from the factory.  This is a ranger XLT with the XLT trim being deleted.  It also has factory roll cage.  The 400M V8 engine was recently rebuilt and the truck runs excellent.    It drives just as good and is very tight and drives straight and true.  The Heavy Duty C6 Transmission shifts perfectly.   6 Inch Suspension Lift and nice wheels and tires really set this Bronco off and give it a great look.  One unique item is the moon roof which was dealer installed shortly after being purchased in 1978-79.       Options include Power Brakes (front disc, power steering, am/fm radio.

pleased to present this 1971 Ford Bronco. Lifted 4x4. Full Soft Top. Great Condition. Must see!  HISTORY  The original Bronco was an ORV (Off-Road Vehicle), intended to compete primarily with Jeep CJ models and the International Harvester Scout. The Bronco's small size riding on a 92-inch (2,337 mm) wheelbase made it maneuverable for some uses, but impractical as a tow vehicle. The Bronco was Ford's first compact SUV.  The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey, who also conceived the Ford Mustang; and similarly, Lee Iacoccapushed the idea through into production. In many ways, the Bronco was a more original concept than the Mustang; whereas the Mustang was based upon the Ford Falcon, the Bronco had a frame, suspension, and a body that were not shared with any other vehicle.

Camera... Action... And we mean plenty of action!!! Here is a very unique classic that possesses the rugged good looks of a matinee idol. Seriously. This 1976 Ford Bronco was used extensively in the award-winning motion picture Logan starring Hugh Jackman. Powerful and relatively compact, the first generation Bronco was one of the original multi-purpose vehicles that ushered in the SUV craze. And this diminutive brute brings loads of character and provenance to the table.  ", "   You'll be immediately mesmerized by this 4X4's tough guy appearance. It's an original Bronco with uncut fenders. That in itself is increasingly hard to find these days. The body is very straight and solid, another rarity for a truck that was essentially built to go bouncing through the woods and around the countryside. But without a doubt, the most riveting aspect of this little celebrity's eye appeal is its faux patina finish. The underneath green and white paint scheme was covered with a special Hollywood concoction of animal fat and denatured alcohol to create a distinctive look that imitates rust and dust. It does a more-than-adequate job of generating the persona of a rough-and-ready roustabout. Perpetuating an air of originality, a fairly stock stance is maintained by a set of 30X9.50R15 B.F. Goodrich radials mounted on factory rims with Ford hubcaps. The removable hard top is in great condition, and all of the chrome trim and emblems are present and show very well. It is actually an awesome-looking ride just as it sits, but the faux patina can be removed fairly easily to return the Bronco to its original presentation. Really, all options are open on this machine. It's up to you.  ", "   The interior is stock in appearance and looks to be in decent shape overall. It was purposely never cleaned after filming of the movie, so there is some dirt and dust throughout the inside that was deliberately laid in by the productions staff. A few hours of Saturday afternoon detailing would work wonders for this personable little SUV, if that's the way you want to go. The black vinyl upholstery looks and feels really nice, and the front bucket seats have been recovered.  The door panels and dash all seem to be in good shape as well. A column shifter controls the automatic transmission, while a floor mounted lever engages the four-wheel-drive. Optional accessories include power steering and brakes, and an AM/FM cassette. The front cardboard headliner is beginning to sag a bit, which is a pretty common issue with Broncos from this era, but all-around, It's an excellent vintage vehicle for the guy who enjoys adding the finishing touches to the centerpiece of his car collection, or one that wants a piece of movie memorabilia.  ", "   Hiding beneath the hood is one of the most popular power plants of all time, Ford's legendary 302 V8. It has earned a well-deserved reputation for performance and durability.

The Bronco is probably one of the most sought out and desirable classic trucks to date. This Bronco is powered by a strong 302 CID V8 that was rebuilt along with the transmission by Atlas Auto roughly 3 years ago. The engine and transmission weren\u00c3\u00a2??t the only things rebuilt, or replaced on the piece of history. The electrical ignition switch, water pump, starter, power steering pump, new radiator, rebuilt gear box transfer case, rebuilt carburetor, new motor & transmission mounts, new rear main seal, and drive shafts have all been replaced. There has been near $25,000 in restoration parts throughout this Bronco to ensure it is ready for the streets, or mud take your preference. The restoration had came from both Tech Auto and Atlas Auto throughout the last 3 years keeping this beast up to par with all the other Bronco\u00c3\u00a2??s out on the street. The list goes on and on with documented repairs done, 12 pages worth to be specific from a practically new engine to a new wiper blades and even replacing head lamps ensure that it\u00c3\u00a2??ll be hard to find something wrong on this truck. The overall condition of the truck speaks for itself, it is in great shape and in dire need of a new owner. The truck sits on a set of black 15\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d steel wheels that are wrapped in 32\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d BF Goodrich All Terrain tires provide plenty of traction and tread life to keep you rolling down the street. If you feel you want to take it off the roads and have a little more fun just switch it into 4WD and enjoy! The interior is meant to withstand whatever you choose to throw at it. The entire floor had been coated with rhino bed liner to prevent any potential of rust developing and to also make it easy to clean after ripping through the mud pits as it is waterproof. You\u00c3\u00a2??ll also notice the nicely done roll cage to prevent anyone who chooses to take this truck to gymnastics tryouts doesn\u00c3\u00a2??t get injured in the process. Some additional features include seatbelts, power steering, cd player, aftermarket steering wheel, aluminum wheels, and AM/FM Radio.

included the Jeep CJ-5 and International Harvester Scout; it was built on its own platform. A major redesign in 1978 enlarged the Bronco, using a shortened Ford F-Series truck chassis to compete with the similarly adapted Chevy K5 Blazer and the Dodge Ramcharger. Most Broncos are equipped with a swing-away spare tire carrier on the outside of the rear door. The third generation beginning development in 1977 (before its predecessor was released for sale) the 1980\u20131986 Bronco was designed to address many concerns that held the 1978\u20131979 Bronco out of production.
