Well, we'd argue that when they're as well-preserved as this 1985 Dodge D100 Custom Prospector, they're definitely worth considering. With Chevys and Fords starting to get some attention, you Mopar guys deserve a cool, affordable way to have some old-school fun.", "The Prospector package added a bunch of chrome trim to the simple Dodge D100 (this is before they officially started calling them ''Ram'') and we have to admit that it looks fantastic. The two-tone paint is quite recent and outshines anything else in this price range and even some vehicles costing three or four times as much. It's really nice! There's no sign that this truck was ever a work vehicle beyond making the commute to some cushy office job and the shiny chrome trim would make it feel at home just about anywhere. Dodge's regular cab with a short box combination has better proportions than Ford or Chevy, too, as if the bed is a little longer; whatever the case it looks right. The bumpers shine up beautifully and you can tell that a guy who loves his truck owns this one, because the bed is protected with a blue spray-in bedliner AND a rubber mat.", "Prospector trim meant cloth interior, not slippery vinyl, as well as some wood appliques on the dash to warm things up a bit. Dark blue carpets are in excellent condition and might be original, and their condition is probably due to those matching carpeted mats with blue bindings. A full array of gauges are a great find in a truck like this, as is working factory A/C (could perhaps use a shot of Freon), cruise control, and an upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo in the center of the dash. The funky three-spoke steering wheel is pure 1980s but the rest of the interior appointments look timeless, ensuring that this truck will look great in 10 or 20 years, too. The 66,201 miles shown on the odometer are actual, so there are no high-mileage issues (or low-mileage issues); it's been driven enough to stay healthy but not enough to wear it out. Nice!", "Speaking of driving, the 225 cubic inch slant-6 under the hood is going to surprise you. Don't write this truck off because it doesn't have a V8, because the virtually indestructible slant-6 is ready, willing, and able to have plenty of fun. It's silky smooth and has a voice unlike the usual trucks you see at the cruise night, and people will give it a double-take when they see the open hood. It's completely stock, from the air cleaner to the exhaust manifolds, and while it looks busy under the hood, maintenance is actually a snap and parts are readily available (even performance parts). Power steering and brakes make it easy to drive and the 3-speed automatic transmission is a great partner for the torquey six. Obviously, it's been living in a warm climate its entire life because it's as clean underneath as it is up top and again, it's stock right down to the newer single exhaust with catalytic converter. Recent shocks ensure that this truck rides better than you'd expect and those shiny chrome wheels and 255/70/15 BFGoodrich radials give it a sporty personality.", "Collectable or not?

The recipient of a documented, cost-no-object frame-off restoration, it's not only beautiful, but packs a stout 340 under the hood, a bunch of creature comforts like cold A/C, and a classic old-school look that Mopar fans will love.", "Trucks were getting a lot more modern-looking in 1971, but the Dodge retained its old look, and with the hindsight that the decades have brought us, it makes for a really attractive pickup. The bright Seafoam Green paint with a white roof is a period-perfect combination and the finish work is show-quality throughout. The truck was fully disassembled, the cab was removed from the frame, and every inch of metal that needed to be fixed or straightened was treated properly. Panel gaps are exacting, the big hood fits tight, and the finish is deep enough to look right on a show-winning Cadillac, not just a vintage pickup. The white grille up front is an old-school look that works exceptionally well on the D13 and all the weather seals are new, so it closes up tightly. There's a polished tool box in the bed, which is home to a modern fuel cell, and the floor is diamond-plate, although we're pretty sure this truck is just too pretty to do any heavy hauling these days.", "At first glance, you're probably thinking that's a nicely restored stock interior, and you're partly right. The bench seat and body-colored door panels are pretty much the way it came from the factory, but look again at the stitching on the seat, the handsome four-spoke steering wheel on a tilt column, and the under-dash A/C unit. The factory gauges are handsome laid out in a long panel that should look familiar to any Mopar fan, with a tach neatly installed in the dash just to the right. A Sony AM/FM/CD stereo head unit slots into the dash and sounds great in the newly insulated cab, and just check out how bright the courtesy lights are, something you almost never see. Everything in the truck is show quality and the attention to detail is very impressive.", "A 340 cubic inch V8 was rebuilt and dropped between the fenders, giving this pickup the moves of a muscle car. It's got less than 500 miles on the build and with a 4-barrel carburetor (although it's plumbed up to the engine bay should one want to switch to a fuel injected set-up) and a decent cam inside, it's plenty potent to move the pickup without apparent effort. It's beautifully detailed, too, with the bright Hemi Orange engine glowing from within the turquoise engine bay and all the ancillary parts wear factory-style finishes. A reproduction decal on the air cleaner looks right and niceties such as power steering and brakes have been added to make it easy to drive. You'll note a giant aluminum radiator up front, all-new A/C components with R134a refrigerant, and beautifully refinished exhaust manifolds. It's backed by a TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic and an 8.75-inch rear end with 3.25 gears inside, so it's easy to live with and doesn't get busy on the highway. The chassis is fully restored and is beautifully framed by the body-colored floors. There's also a coil spring front suspension, disc brakes, new exhaust, and fresh shocks, plus a full-sized spare hanging out back. The stance was tweaked just a bit and you've probably already noticed the custom-made wheels with dog dish hubcaps and trim rings, designed for slightly wider 235/75/15 front and 31x10.5R15 rear Toyo blackwall radials.", "If you want the nicest D13, heck, one of the nicest pickups of any kind we've ever featured, this is it.
