With fresh paint, custom bodywork, custom interior, and a strong 302 V8 under the hood, it's a great pony with its own gallop.  ", "  A fresh coat of a light blue gives this coupe very deep and slick clearcoat appearance.  There is a silver element that gives it a touch of chrome-like feeling.  In fact, it shines so well it was used in places traditionally reserved for brightwork like the gas cap and custom front end. But the custom elements don't end there.  GT fog lights, unique dual exhaust tips, and 17-inch alloys inspired from the later Bullitt Mustangs complete a true standout package.  ", "  Inside, the low back bucket seats, door panel pattern, and dual cowl dash seem familiar, but the setup is completely unique.  The black and silver cloth on the seats maximizes comfort, and it coordinates nicely with everything inside.  There's a comfortable center console that includes an armrest, gear selector, and controls for the power windows.  Ahead of that are all the controls for the heat/defrost and amplified AM/FM/CD stereo system.  When you sit in the driver's seat, you instantly feel that this is a more powerful pony.  There's a rim blown Mustang wheel, which was part of the later first-gen packaging (when cars like the Boss 302 were available.)  And you also get a full set of Dolphin gauges, including a large speedo and tach.  ", "  This one is powered by a performance-built 302 cubic-inch V8 motor, which is larger than anything you could get in a Mustang for 1966.  The upgrades continue with the attention-grabbing Monte Carlo bar, as well as the shiny Edelbrock performance air cleaner and valve covers.  What is a bit harder to spot are features like the Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor and the long tube headers that feed the performance H-pipe dual exhaust system.  This V8 provide plenty of extra power, but that's not the only thing that makes this total package great.  It's mated to an AOD four-speed automatic transmission with highway-friendly overdrive.  Add in the power steering, front disc brakes, and the grip of Dunlop performance tires, and you have a speedy classic that's easy to drive anywhere.  ", "  Upgraded, unique, and affordable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this Mustang is a great package at a gone tomorrow price.  So you know you need to hurry up if you want to take it home.

So when you can get this icon looking completely vintage on the outside, but with an upgraded A/C interior and more powerful V8 under the hood, it's the best of everything in one affordable coupe.  ", "  A Mustang all dressed in gloss black certainly makes you the dark horse wherever you arrive.  But it takes more than luster to create the desire you see here. Bodywork is well done, creases are crisp, and everything lines up nicely to remind us all why we love this icon.  Plus, the bumpers, badging, and trim are all straight and complete, which is why this overall package is so impressive.   You can tell there have been some nice investments in retaining the stock appearance, right down to the stylized wheel covers.  ", "  But inside the upgrades are a bit more obvious.  Nothing goes better with a black exterior than a red interior, and so when the outside was switched to the dark hue, the inside got a sinisterly aggressive color makeover.  So while the red seat covers look stock, and they have a feeling of quality to let you know that they are much younger than '65.  And the carpeting and door panels match its vibrancy.  You get great factory items like heat/defrost sliders and a center console.  Plus, there are nice upgrades like the Grant sports steering wheel and an AM/FM/CD stereo with aux hookup for modern music players.   ", "  Under the hood is the legendary 289 cubic-inch V8, and it has been upgraded for both style and substance.  Radiating from the dark engine bay are great elements like the shiny air topper and freshly painted blue valve covers.  Plus, the V8's performance has been enhanced with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, newer radiator, and long tube headers that feed a rumbling dual exhaust.  On the road, the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes come together to make sure that this enhanced V8 is one pony that you can easily corral.  ", "  You're looking at a two-owner American icon that's been so well cared for you even get the owner's manual.  A Mustang that's turnkey with all the right vintage looks and all the right upgrades is irresistible.

The Mustang is not only the granddaddy of the pony car, but it's a gateway to the hobby that remains affordable, fun, and universally loved. There just aren't many other vehicles that are known around the world that can also deliver this much fun for so little cash.  ", "  This C-code ragtop is Exhibit A in the case of why Mustangs are great. First, it looks awesome, from the styling to the proportions to the code J Rangoon Red paint, which gives it a traditional high-visibility Mustang look. It is indeed this car's original color, and you can imagine the delighted first owner taking it home nearly fifty years ago, top down and a big, silly grin on his or her face. Well, that's what'll happen today when this car's next owner comes to collect it, too. This isn't a show car, so you don't need to fret about rain and bugs on the grille, but it does look good enough to make you wash it in the FRONT yard rather than out back, just so folks can see it. The paint job is a few years old, but shines up well and captures the original color pretty darned well. They skipped the stripes and fake GT bits, but it does have a beautiful grille, the quarter panel insert, and shiny chrome bumpers that look and fit great.   ", "  The two-tone interior is a great complement to the bright red bodywork, offering a familiar disposition and adds to the Mustang's light-hearted attitude. The seat covers are slightly customized reproductions that have a few signs of use but remain in great shape, and the matching red carpets seem to anchor the interior.  Factory-style door panels are in good condition, too, complete with a rather rare remote side mirror option. There's no center console, but it does have an under-dash A/C unit that could probably be made to function by adding modern hardware under the hood (many kits are available for this). The steering wheel is in excellent condition and the wide speedometer and auxiliary gauges appear to be in good original shape. This car carries the important options like a power convertible top and power steering, both of which make it daily-driver friendly, and the trunk offers a reproduction mat and spare tire cover (with spare tire, of course).  ", "  This pony carries a correct C-code 289 cubic inch V8, now upgraded to A-code specs with an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust. Correctly finished with black engine enamel and chrome tinwork, it's a smooth, reliable cruiser, not a racer, a role the little V8 is happy to fill. There is lots of evidence of recent work, including a Pertronix electronic ignition system that lights it off right away, and the way it runs means you'll be looking for excuses to take it out of the garage every chance you get. A C4 3-speed automatic transmission adds to its user-friendly nature and according to the door tag, the rear gears are tall 2.80s so it just loafs along at highway speeds.
