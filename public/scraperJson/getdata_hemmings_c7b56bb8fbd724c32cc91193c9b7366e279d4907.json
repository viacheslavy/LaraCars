This car has been fully restored and includes some interesting and desirable upgrades. One is a modern five speed transmission providing synchromesh in all forward gears, better gear spacing, and overdrive fifth (and it dosen't leak).  Another is its aluminum wheels which are true knock-off type wheels, not bolt on types.  It also has a stainless steel exhaust system.  This car was under the stewardship of a single owner going back over 30 years.  That owner acquired the car as what he describes as a basket case.  Under his care it was body off frame restored and the body, frame, and undercarriage are all solid and rust free.  The paint presents very well without noticeable flaws.   Its attractive interior is finished in red leather with white piping is excellent throughout. The carpets are in fine condition with no indication of wear.  The engine was rebuilt and hardened valve seats installed in the head for compatibility with lead free fuel.  It has a Pertronix ignition and was upgraded to a modern alternator.  The engine is in top condition, holding excellent oil pressure, no exhaust smoke, and delivers strong performance.  The five speed is a Toyota Supra unit and one of the Smitty conversions which can be read about on various Internet and Healey sites.  The clutch action is smooth and the modern five speed transmission adds to the driving experience without the maintenance worries that accompanied the original gearboxes in these cars.  The brakes, suspension, and steering are all in good order.  This car needs nothing other than a new caretaker to drive and enjoy the Big Healey experience.
