If you're shopping Chevelles, you're probably looking for an LS6 Super Sport. If you're shopping Mustangs, you're probably looking for a first-generation coupe. And if you're shopping Chargers, you're probably looking for something between 1968 and 1970. That's a somewhat sad, but beneficial, phenomenon. Sad because it means a lot of great cars just don't get the respect they deserve. Beneficial because a lot of fine metal, like this classy 1972 Charger SE, can be purchased for very reasonable prices. As charming as it is cool, this award-winning hardtop wraps an original 400/3-speed drivetrain in warm blue aesthetics that are guaranteed to turn heads. It's the perfect way for any enthusiast to grab a neat old car and enjoy every aspect of the hobby!    BODY    Much nicer than when it rolled off Chrysler's St. Louis assembly lines, this slick hardtop is the beneficiary of a no-expense-spared rotisserie restoration that wrapped correct Powder Blue 2-stage around a largely original profile. That profile shows no signs of significant repair, suggesting it was a straight, trouble-free canvas before the car's metamorphosis began. Panel gaps are good enough to make painted pinstripes line up exactly right. Fresh chrome and highly polished stainless look great under bright emblems and a tight vinyl top. And overall, this fully sorted Dodge is a unique representation of a more luxurious era of Motor City mayhem!    DRIVETRAIN    Lift this Dodge's long hood and you'll find Chrysler's stalwart, 400 cubic inch B V8 that, introduced to replace the firm's venerable 383, is a popular choice for high performance builds thanks to its big bore, proven strength and excellent interchangeability. Behind that original mill, an original A727 TorqueFlite spins a 10-bolt axle. That smooth drivetrain feeds a fully sorted front torsion bar and rear leaf suspension that's shackled to factory power steering. Cool and confident stops are provided by a correct combination of power-assisted discs and power-assisted drums. Exhaust floats through a factory-style pipe and traditional turbo muffler. And at the corners of the floors, Powder Blue steelies spin G78-14 BF Goodrich Silvertown whitewalls around red-trimmed poverty caps.     INTERIOR    Swivel this coupe's level doors and you'll find a correct Bright Blue interior that reflects the luxurious push of early 1970s America. Broad seats, a split bench up front and traditional bench out back, are wrapped in pliable vinyl covers that display hardly any signs of wear. In front of those thrones, a wood-trimmed dash hangs rebuilt telemetry above factory air conditioning and a Chrysler Solid State radio. In front of the driver, an ornate, color-keyed steering wheel laps a traditional column shifter. And behind the passengers, a nicely finished trunk features a correct jack and spare tire.

The 1966 Dodge Charger is the first year for the now iconic name.  So with such an important coupe, we are thrilled to have one in such a survivor-grade presentation.  With its sweeping fastback lines, factory-original paint, unique interior, and powerful V8 under the hood, you're looking at a genuine hero at a workman's price.  ", "  The beautifully sweeping fastback were born out of gaining an advantage at the racetracks, and it created one of the most distinct designs of the '60s.  Dodge was catching up to the new craze of more personal sports cars started by the Mustang, so their historically low production numbers are especially true for the mid-year introduction of these 1966 coupes.  But part of the reason why these were a little late to the party was because they were getting the design right.  More than just the bold roofline, this one has some very thoughtful design elements.  It starts with the bright full-width grille. The chrome side moldings start here and run continuously over the Coronet's rear kick up, and it doesn't stop until the wide rear bumper.  The result is almost like a wraparound effect of brightwork.  Plus, the rear full width taillight panel is a hallmark element that we still look for today on the modern Charger.  And so when you see all of these important design elements, you instantly understand why one family has been caring for this coupe for more than half a century.  The factory Beige paint looks amazing for its age, and it still gives off a great gloss on a sunny day.  The body panels line up nicely so you can still shut the doors with authority.  Even the factory-correct wheel covers are in place.  This is a true survivor!  ", "  The Charger did not come cheap, and so they made sure the interior was a true premium experience with four buckets for everyone's comfort. Just like the exterior, we cannot find anywhere that isn't factory original on this tan upholstery.  In fact, everything is so correct and original, even the AM radio is still cranking out the tunes! Everyone gets the luxury of the full length center console with armrests, making for a very sleek interior that looks upscale.  Plus, the rear seats individually fold flat for versatility not seen on many vintage sports cars.  The gauges are absolute works of art, exquisite aircraft-inspired dials with markings around the perimeter and have a very modern glow at night. You get a three-spoke sports steering wheel, and Chrysler fans will recognize the simple but elegant shifter for the automatic transmission.  ", "  Under the hood, the 318 cubic-inch V8 looks both powerful and honest with a bright red presentation within the correct Beige engine bay.  And as we mentioned before, this coupe has only been in the care of one family all its life.  They have taken care of it correctly, and you understand that the moment you hear the motor's quiet and precise idle.  The low mileage is even believed to be o"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars", "title": "1966 Dodge Charger ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "18995", "kilometers": 103677.524, "total_pages": 3, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/36897055", "brand": "Dodge", "reference_id": "36897055", "year": "1966", "model": "Charger", "specs": {"Engine": "318 V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "64,436 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Stock #": "1041-TPA", "Interior/Exterior": "Tan / Beige", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Tan / Beige"}},
