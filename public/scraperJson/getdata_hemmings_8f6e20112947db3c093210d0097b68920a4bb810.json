A new pair of auxiliary radiator fans along with a fresh water pump have been fitted. All of the body and window seal rubber were replaced, as the original had begun to deteriorate from age. Also, a new correct OEM, not an aftermarket, windscreen glass was sourced and installed with the fresh seal, due to the original beginning to delaminate.

The second thought in reference to the car in this ad is that color is always very important and XKE's in cream just have a certain amount of extra \"POP\"!   As you can see from the photos of this 1969 Jaguar XKE coupe that is listed it is strikingly beautiful. It is interesting to note that a previous owner who appears to have had much experience with the early XKE's with their 3.8 engines, decided that while he loved the lines of his 1969 Jaguar coupe, he much preferred the early 3.8 engines to the six cylinder engines that were factory installed in the 1969 Jaguars.  With that in mind he proceeded to replace the 4.2 engine with a 3.8 engine.  The current owner has had the engine super detailed.  It is our understanding from the private seller that the 3.8 engine has under 500 miles since 1988.  Actual mileage unknown.The current owner has driven this car on trips up to about 50 miles and has indicated that it drives just as it should. The manual transmission operates as it should.The cream paint is complimented by the red leather interior. The current owner would like to make note that the radio is currently not working and he believes that it is not the original radio. The 1969 Jaguar XKE coupe in this listing has been fully detailed with all engine and body parts cleaned.  Take a look at the photos to see how exceptionally well that the car does show. The current owner describes the appearance of this car as a beautiful driver but certainly not a trailer queen. Considering how the XKE's have been escalating in price, the reserve is very conservative and you can certainly feel free to bid to win and be happy that you did."], "Exterior:": "White", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "473"}},
