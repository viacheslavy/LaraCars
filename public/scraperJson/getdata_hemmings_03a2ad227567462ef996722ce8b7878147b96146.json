It was the companys first road going model with a mid-mounted, flat 12-cylinder engine, which was subsequently nicknamed the Boxer, for its opposing pistons. The exotic design was derived from the companys three-liter Formula One car, and it took two years to bring into production. It was finally launched in late 1973, as a 1974 model, and only 387 were built in the following three years. Road & Track hit 175 mph in one during a road test in 1975, allowing it to dub the original Boxer the fastest road car weve ever tested.As the replacement for the iconic 365 GTB/4 Daytona was the 365 GT4/BB, and it was produced alongside the Daytona before Ferrari fully transitioning to the Berlinetta Boxer, they momentarily abandoned the front-engine layout in favor of mid-engine cars for its top-performance models. This 365 Boxer was produced between 1973 and 1976, before production changed over to the 512 BB.No. 17847 offered here is Ferrari Classique Certified with just 29,970 KM (18,700 Miles)."]}},

This also had the side effect of making the doors very wide.", "The 348 was equipped with a dry-sump oil system to prevent oil starvation at high speeds and during hard cornering.

Drive to the gearbox is via a single-plate, diaphragm-spring clutch and a set of drop-gears located outboard of the left-hand end of the crankshaft, with output torque feeding into a friction-plate limited-slip final drive unit offset to the rear of the gearbox. For these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins' cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the center chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.", "Suspension systems are fully independent all-round, comprising unequal-length upper and lower wishbones, coil-over damper units and anti-roll bars at each end. Steering is an unpowered rack-and-pinion mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels. Braking is via four-wheel ventilated disks with split-circuit vacuum assistance.", "Inside, the seats and interior are fully trimmed in black Connolly leather, with the exception of the use of black vinyl for the dashboard top and upper door linings. A previous owner spent about $3,000 refreshing the interior and it looks great. The power antenna is inoperable. All seats, including those in the rear, are strongly bucket-shaped and fitted with inertia-reel seatbelts. The matching carpet is in similar shape to the seats, the inner door panels are in great shape, as are the center console and mirror glass.", "A central tunnel for the chassis is prominent in both front and rear foot wells and is straddled by a large front center console with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) are standard fitments with their controls on the central console. A three-spoked Momo steering wheel is mounted to a steering column adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a \u201cpod-style\u201d instrument binnacle holding six gauges \u2013 speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature.
