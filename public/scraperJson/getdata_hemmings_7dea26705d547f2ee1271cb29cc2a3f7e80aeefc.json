Even Enzo Ferrari admitted that it was one of the most beautiful cars that he had ever seen. Of all the E-Types the first of its kind, the Series 1 cars, are the most sought after version of the historic E-Type cars with their \u201csmall mouth nose\u201d and early style taillights located above the rear bumpers which were produced through 1968. Beginning with a 3.8 Liter twin cam 6 cylinder engine carried over from the XK150 3.8 S cars, in 1964 Jaguar decided to enlarge the displacement of their bulletproof twin cam six to 4.2 liters which was to be used until the end of the Series 2 car production. Like many other cars, certain years become a transitional period where a later design is merged with an earlier one, sometimes resulting in a car that has the best attributes of both designs, which brings us to the 1968 XKE. 1968 was the last year for the Series 1 and because of this it was the most refined version. Still retaining the bodylines of a series 1, but adding the upgraded Stromberg carburetors from the outdated SU's, adding the more modern rocker switches on the dash replacing the toggle switches and beginning half way through the 1967 model year, the covers on the headlights were removed for better visibility at night. Overall the 1968 model year is the most refined version of the legendary Series 1 offering the looks of the Series 1 and the best upgrades of the Series 2.", "This 1968 Series 1 OTS is a wonderful example having just 30,000 original miles since new and having just two owners since 1968. Complete with its original hardtop and a Jaguar heritage certificate, this car is finished in its original color of primrose yellow with a black leather interior just as it left the factory. The paint, chrome and upholstery are all in wonderful condition showing that that this car was very well cared for over its life. The matching numbers engine runs wonderfully well and can be driven and enjoyed without worry. The body shows no signs of ever having rust or patch work which really solidifies the cars low original mileage. This is a beautiful low mileage Series 1 XKE OTS that has been well cared for over the years and is ready to be a part of a great sports car collection or to be driven and enjoyed for years to come."]}},

The second thought in reference to the car in this ad is that color is always very important and XKE's in cream just have a certain amount of extra \"POP\"!   As you can see from the photos of this 1969 Jaguar XKE coupe that is listed it is strikingly beautiful. It is interesting to note that a previous owner who appears to have had much experience with the early XKE's with their 3.8 engines, decided that while he loved the lines of his 1969 Jaguar coupe, he much preferred the early 3.8 engines to the six cylinder engines that were factory installed in the 1969 Jaguars.  With that in mind he proceeded to replace the 4.2 engine with a 3.8 engine.  The current owner has had the engine super detailed.  It is our understanding from the private seller that the 3.8 engine has under 500 miles since 1988.  Actual mileage unknown.The current owner has driven this car on trips up to about 50 miles and has indicated that it drives just as it should. The manual transmission operates as it should.The cream paint is complimented by the red leather interior. The current owner would like to make note that the radio is currently not working and he believes that it is not the original radio. The 1969 Jaguar XKE coupe in this listing has been fully detailed with all engine and body parts cleaned.  Take a look at the photos to see how exceptionally well that the car does show. The current owner describes the appearance of this car as a beautiful driver but certainly not a trailer queen.
