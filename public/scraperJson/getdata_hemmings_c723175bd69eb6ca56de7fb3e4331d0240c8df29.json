With a gorgeous black and silver color combination, a 4-speed transmission, and a strong-running V8, this is a car that you can drive without worries and still show up and be the star of the show.", "This is the Corvette that you've been looking for, because it's nicely maintained but has never, ever been a trailer queen. It offers what is arguably the most attractive of the early solid axle styling, with single headlights, just enough chrome, and a gently rounded tail that has exactly the right look for America in the late 1950s. The Tuxedo Black finish is the car's original color and it looks quite good going down the road, although there's some age and wear in the usual places, which is hardly a demerit on a car like this. Fortunately, it appears that this car has always been special to someone, which is just as it should be with a unique find like this. The side cove could be a second color in 1957, and silver is the right choice, offering contrast but it's softer than bright white. The chrome and stainless trim remains in excellent condition, showing off the glittering jewelry that made all cars of the '50s, even Corvettes, so special.", "The sparkling tan interior was surely high style in 1957 regardless of what you were going to do with the car. Handsome patterned upholstery stays cool and is easy to maintain, and while it's showing some age, it remains a great place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon. The big three-spoke steering wheel is color-matched to the rest of the interior and recalls the great sports cars of Europe, which was entirely intentional on Chevy's part. You got a full array of gauges along the center of the dash, although the AM radio was optional in 1957. The 4-speed was also an option, but that might just be the most important one of all on this car. The C1s are also nice because they offer a real trunk with plenty of room, complete with a spare tire rucked under the rubber mat, just in case.", "The 283 cubic inch V8 under the forward-tilting hood is not the original block, but it looks right and runs very well. The engine bay has a lot of originality, which may be a plus for the right buyer and if you insist on perfection, well, it's not so dirty that it needs a major investment of time and money. But for most of us, cars like this are all about getting in and driving, and this small block has no qualms about hitting the road. The 4-speed was new for 1957 and this appears to be the original transmission for the car and it feeds the stock rear end, and they highlight a chassis that is either a miraculously maintained original or one that has been extensively detailed, because it looks awesome. A correct dual exhaust system cackles and barks like you'd expect and it sits exactly right on 215/75/15 whitewall radials with hubcaps and spinners, just as it was in 1957.", "In a world filled with pedigreed Corvettes that owners are afraid to drive, this '57 stands proud as a road warrior. We might venture to suggest that even at this price, it represents a very smart buy for the right collector. Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Onxy black", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "4631"}}
