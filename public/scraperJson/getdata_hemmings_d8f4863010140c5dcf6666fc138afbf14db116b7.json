This particular example is beautifully optioned in Snowcrest White with silver coves and black interior.  She wears the appropriate hub caps with knock offs wrapped in wide white wall tires.  The chrome trim on this particular car is in great shape and makes for a dazzling piece of eye candy.  Inside youll find more chrome and stainless trim to accent the black upholstery.  Youll also find another very rare option: power windows which only 587 buyers chose in 1959.  Driving enthusiasts will be delighted to see that behind the 290 HP v8 is a proper 4 speed manual transmission.  Speaking of the drive train the engine has been completely rebuild and perhaps even more importantly the fuel injection system has been rebuilt by an expert that specializes in these systems.  The car runs beautifully and is a delight to pilot down the road.  Being a Fuelie and therefore quite rare this is a true collectors piece.  This car would be at home in the most avid Corvette collectors garage.

The first generation Corvette has always been one of the most memorable and iconic designs amongst Corvette enthusiasts and car lovers all over. Corvettes were completely redesigned in 1958 with quad headlights and chrome trunk spears. One of the most popular design cues of its time was the exhaust flowing through the rear bumper which eliminated the original exhausts location which was an eye sore. This Roman Red beauty with Bright White coves with American Flag Vinyl and offsetting Black interior is sure to turn heads and always provide that infamous Little Red Corvette appeal.  The 230 horsepower 283 CI V8 has been replaced with a Chevy small block with Edelbrock intake and carb that runs nice and strong and is a blast to drive with the 4-speed transmission. There is no better feeling than an open road and  this Corvette is definitely a cruiser and the manual transmission makes for a car that is much more fun to drive.  Special care was taken to preserve as much of the originality of this car and many items were preserved in lieu of replacement. This is a stunning example of a preserved and updated original that is ready for the next incline in value.  This Corvette will absolutely make for a great addition to any collection.  This car emphasizes originality and can definitely be described as a time capsule that deserves to go the right home where it will be treated with care to ensure a long life ahead of it.  If you are in the market for a cruiser that will pay you to drive it look no further.  This Corvette is sure to make its next owner a very happy collector.
