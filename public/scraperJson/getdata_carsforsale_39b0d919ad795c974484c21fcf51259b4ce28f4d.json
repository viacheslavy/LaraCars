This beautiful specimen is something you don't see very often: an unrestored, original paint, original interior '66.  This Catalina has just 91,453 original miles, and has been lovingly maintained since new.  It sports the factory green paint which looks better than the paint on cars half its age.  It sits on the factory hub caps as well with appropriate white wall tires.  The interior looks equally as untouched with superbly clean black upholstery which hardly looks used.  There are meat reminders of how these full sized sedans were used.  There's an aftermarket AC unit that was added at one point to keep occupants cool during the summer.  There is an aftermarket cruise control unit that was added to aid in the long road trips.  Perhaps the most charming feature is the trailer hitch which was used to tow a small boat trailer to the summer vacation spots.  It's clear this Pontiac has had a relaxing life.  She currently sports a 400 CID V8 which was rebuild roughly 10,000 miles ago.  The rest of the equipment has been kept factory.  If you're looking for a beautiful road trip cruiser to hit route '66 in, this is it.  Check out this 1966 Pontiac Catalina in greater detail in our Milwaukee showroom or at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.

check out the upgrades to the interior, suspension, and 400 V8, you'll soon realize that this is one of the best values in muscle machines today.  ", "  This is sought-after year for Pontiac fans.  The upgraded Endura front end has a powerful, pointy presence; the sheetmetal has a curvy Coke-bottle profile; and the chrome rear bumper is expertly integrated into the design.  Plus, we love a year-correct color like Mayfair Maize on this coupe.  It gives this an approachable first impression.  But then people spot upgrades like the dual cowl hood, dark tinted windows, GTO badging, and those shiny 17-inch American Racing Torq Thurst wheels.  All of this quickly reveals this coupe's dark side.  ", "  You paid a little bit more for a Pontiac back in the day, and the premium difference can be felt the moment you sit down in the bucket seats.  All the black elements, including the seat covers, door panel, and carpeting have the feeling of solid investment.  This is a comfortable center console car with bright wood appearance panels used through the center section and dash to break up its fashionable black. While all this looks premium and factory-correct, you can instantly tell there have been some nice investments in upgrades, too.  You feel it the moment you grab the grippy three-spoke sports steering wheel.  And when you twist the key, the AM/FM/CD stereo and full gauge cluster begin radiate a digital glow that tells you there are plenty more upgrades throughout.  ", "  Pontiac's big 400 cubic-inch V8 looks great with its correct blue block as well as the upgraded finned air grabber and valve covers.  This rebuilt V8 has the unmistakable look of performance, and it's is backed up by go-fast goodies like a four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, and long tube headers that also contribute to the thundering dual exhaust.  Making sure all this power gets to the ground is a rebuilt TH400 three-speed automatic transmission and a stout 12-bolt rear end.  But more than just pure power, this tribute car has been upgraded to outmaneuver the original GTOs.  It has been given a full UMI Performance suspension upgrade that includes a tubular A-arm front suspension, new shocks, new bushings, and thick sway bars front & rear.  Plus, the brakes are now a full Wilwood package with slotted and vented discs at all four corners.  There's even the superior grip of modern Nitto NT555 Extreme ZR tires.  ", "  Starting to get the full picture on this one? For a very affordable price, you have a muscle coupe that was updated and fortified to be a true street-eating machine.  So you know a deal like this speedy Pontiac will be moving quickly.

Nightly duels between F-bodies and the Mustang 5.0 were the beginning of a new muscle car era, and cars like this 1985 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am were almost universally respected for not only their performance, but for their good looks, too.  ", "  There was also a brief period when the fourth-generation Firebird was the most aerodynamic car made in America, but that's kind of beside the point. The truth is, the sucker just looked great, with an aggressive long, low profile and hidden headlights that gave all of us who grew up in the '80s a dream that we could afford. This one is a shockingly unmodified 40,000-mile survivor that is very nicely preserved in its original two tone gray color scheme. The Trans Am got more aggressive lower body cladding, a deeper chin spoiler, and a modest rear wing, all of which remain in excellent condition with no signs of accidents or even curb damage on the chin. GM's paint quality was spotty at best in the '80s, but this one still wears its factory-applied paint and it looks quite good for being 25 years old and the decals in particular are especially well-preserved. There's no giant chicken on the hood, which is kind of a relief, but it does have functional louvers that look cool without being too obvious. Folding headlights give it a clean profile and the special Trans Am taillights are crystal clear.   ", "  The Trans Am was GM's way of taking the F-body a little up-market, and the handsome two-tone gray cloth interior is full of comfort and convenience options, not to mention a set of comfortable bucket seats. The light fabric is great for cruising because it doesn't get hot like leather does, and it's grippy, so the seats hold you in place during aggressive driving. There's minimal wear, especially considering the age and mileage, and even the door panels and carpets remain in very good condition. All the gauges work properly, the A/C blows cold, and the original stereo still offers an auto-reverse cassette deck (remember those?) and a graphic equalizer, and honestly, it sounds decent. It's also outfitted with power windows and locks, cruise control, a rear defroster, and a tilt steering column, making it one of the most heavily optioned T/As we've seen in a long time. And it's so well-preserved that even the hatch area's carpets are completely unmarked. Nice!  ", "  Power for this one comes from GM's venerable 5.0 liter V8, one of the first to be fitted with GM's famous Tuned Port Injection system. Since more horsepower was little more than a phone call away, it's remarkable that this one is still 100% stock. It runs beautifully, with a crisp burble from the exhaust and the torque that made these engines famous. It's a bit grumpy when it's cold, which is a common trait in the TPI motors, but it sure looks right down there in the Pontiac's engine bay.  It's backed by a 4-speed automatic and a set of highway-friendly 2.73 gears, s"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1985 Pontiac Firebird ", "total_results": "1202 .

pleased to present this 1978 Pontiac Transam.  400 CID V8! A/C. Must See!  HISTORY  Changes for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most obvious from the outside.[14] Beginning in 1978, the Pontiac group introduced a new special edition vehicle. The Firebird Formula LT Sport Edition which featured a revised 10% raised compression Chevy 305 V8 powertrain producing 155 hp (same as 1977 Chevy Monza Mirage) combined with a floor center console four-speed manual T-10 BW transmission coupled to a limited-slip differential final drive. The limited touring package (LT) also included a cabin roof, door, fender and hood graphics scheme, the Trans-Am sports handling package with HD gas shocks, modular alloy wheels and the SE Trans-Am rear deck spoiler with \"Formula\" word graphic detail. T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid year.

Packaged with period correct features and the original 400ci V8, it's handsome, fast, comfortable, and intimidating... all the elements that make the GTO a timeless legend.  With all the optional luxuries, including AC, multiple national awards, and tons of documents, you know you have a winner on your hands.  ", "  The subtle code-40 Mayfair Maize hardtop and black vinyl roof give this a premium vintage appearance that could pass for a simple cool cruiser.  In fact, the level of investment that went into the paint and new top might just stun people into momentarily believing that this is only a well-restored luxury cruiser. The body panels remain straight, the rear chrome bumper is shiny & complete, and the Endura front bumper continues to look correct & color-matched.  Of course you won't be able to keep up this ruse too long.  The correct G-T-O badges that inspire fear in lesser cars are present on each side and easily seen.  Plus, the optional hideaway headlights, hood scoops, and Rally II wheels with the PMD (Pontiac Motor Division) center cap remind everyone who is really king.    ", "  The factory-correct parchment bucket seat interior is quite inviting with nicely detailed seat covers that showcase the always-interesting Pontiac design motif. Plus, the woodgrain paneling on the center console and dash further this upscale feeling.  Of course you want to drive your classic so the thick black carpeting and floor mats mean you don't have to take off your shoes before hopping in for a ride. You get the Pontiac three-spoke steering wheel, and just ahead of that is a tri-pod round gauge design with the speedometer prominently in the middle.  As you look out over the driver-oriented controls, this highly original coupe reminds you of what a premium Pontiac looked like back in the day.  But while this looks like a time capsule, the modern R134a air conditioning will keep you cool like no '60s machine ever could.  ", "  One look at the 400 cubic inch V8, and you're again reminded this GTO is all about honesty and originality. It wears the correct Pontiac Turquoise paint with pride, and it sports a chrome air cleaner lid and valve covers (after all, Pontiac knew its customers would be showing off their engine bay.)  Best of all, this 1969-correct YS block is the original motor.  Pontiac rated the big V8 at 350 hp right out of the box, and there's an added kick from an Edelbrock intake and four-barrel carburetor (the original intake is part of a host of spare components that come with sale.)  And no matter how you decide to run this V8, the sweet rumble of the dual exhaust let's everyone know you have serious power under the hood.  This one handles its performance nicely thanks to the stout TH400 three-speed automatic that sends power to the 10-bolt rear end.  Plus, handling is done right with power steering, disc brakes up front, and BF Goodrich rubber at"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars", "title": "1969 Pontiac GTO ", "total_results": "1202 .

HISTORY  Bonneville models were standard equipped with Hydra-Matic (through 1964) or Turbo Hydra-Matic (1965-on) automatic transmissions. Other options included power steering and power brakes as well as air conditioning. Other popular options included power windows, power seats, radio, cruise control, and 8-lug aluminum wheels that included integral brake drums for improved stopping power. The Bonneville also had more powerful standard V8 engines than other full-sized Pontiacs including the 389 cu in (6.4 l) or 400 cu in (6.6 l) V8s with four-barrel carburetors (power ratings of 303 to 340 hp (226 to 254 kW) depending on year) with many optional V8 offerings available including Tri-Power (three two-barrel carburetor) options on both the 389 cu in (6.4 l) and 421 cu in (6.9 l) V8s that offered up to 376 hp (280 kW) through 1966. For 1962, Pontiac also offered the 421 cu in (6.9 l) Super Duty with two four-barrel carburetors, rated at 405 hp (302 kW), as a US$2,250 option (when the base Bonneville listed at US$3,349).

They Had Side Moldings Running From The Rear Of The Front Wheel Opening To The Rear, Catalina Front Fender Scripts, And Series Medallions On The Rear Fenders.  In 1964, even Pontiac's mid-priced rivals within General Motors responded to the Catalina's success in the marketplace as well as to capture Chevy Impala owners trading up to cars from upscale GM divisions. Buick took its lowest-priced big car, the LeSabre, and lowered the base sticker price further by substituting a smaller 300 cu in V8 engine and two-speed automatic transmission from its intermediate-sized cars in place of the 401 cu in V8 and three-speed automatic used in other big Buicks. Oldsmobile went even further by creating a whole new full-sized series, the Jetstar 88, which was $75 lower than the Dynamic 88 series (but still a few dollars higher than comparable Pontiac Catalina models) and also got a smaller engine - a 330 cu in V8 and two-speed automatic transmission from the intermediate F-85/Cutlass line, along with smaller 9.5 in brake drums (also from the GM intermediates) compared to the 11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 in drums still found on all other GM full-sized cars from the bare-bones six-cylinder Chevrolet Biscayne to the Cadillac 75 limousine. And since the Catalina was still priced lower than the Jetstar and LeSabre, the lowest-priced full-sized Pontiac was often perceived by buyers as a better value in the marketplace due to its larger standard V8 engine and three-speed automatic transmission, and (in comparison to the Jetstar 88) bigger brakes  A TRUE 60'S SURVIVOR SHOWING ONLY 23,949 MILES  Exceptionally Clean, ORIGINAL, Straight And Documented With Pontiac Ident-O-Plate And Original Window Sticker.
