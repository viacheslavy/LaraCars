The seller did change the intake manifold and carburetor to a 4 bbl instead of 2 bbl setup for the added performance. The rest of the vehicle is believed to be restored as it came from the factory. From the Grabber Yellow paint to the 8 track tape player. The front bumper was replaced with a chrome bumper for that fresh sparkly look. The engine has a rock solid idle and accelerates smoothly without a miss. The suspension is well sorted and handles nicely without worrisome noises. The interior was also done to completely original standards and fit and finish are great. If you are a fan of early 70\u00c3\u00a2??s Mustangs then you should not pass up the opportunity on this one. The features include AM Radio with 8 Track, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Seat Belts, Vinyl Interior, Radial Tires, and Rally Wheels.

This 1970 Mach 1 is a bargain compared to its big block siblings, so if you're looking for a genuine Mach 1 you can drive anywhere, here it is! With a brawny 351 under the hood, a high-visibility performance look, and an easy-to-drive demeanor, it's the Mustang for guys who love to hit the road.  ", "  Few will argue that the 1970 Mustang isn't one of the best-looking designs of the muscle car era, particularly in fastback form. But before we talk about performance and engines and all that, take a look at the special Mach 1 gear this one wears, including the low-profile hood scoop, chin spoiler, rear wing, and Mach 1 rocker panel callouts. None of those parts make the car go any faster, but they sure look like they do! The bright red paint is a little brighter than the original Medium Red, but thanks to a bare-metal repaint a few years ago, it's in excellent condition. It shows only very light signs of use, but nobody's going to complain when they hear the rumble of the V8 or the black strip running down the center of the hood. We're not sure what color it was originally, but if you're going to drive a Hi-Po Mustang, you may as well show off a bit, right?   ", "  Few interiors look better than the basic black this Mach 1 sports today. High-back buckets wear Ford's patented comfort-weave upholstery which is just that: a woven vinyl that's surprisingly comfortable and helps keep you cool. Matching door panels and black carpets keep it uniformly dressed, although they might be starting to show their age. Ford's twin-cockpit design puts a quartet of gauges ahead of the driver and it sports desirable options like power steering and brakes, a woodgrained steering wheel, and a center console. Gauges are original and operational, although the gauge faces are a little cloudy and while the original AM radio is still in the dash, it's not working and is due for an upgrade. It shows well overall, further proof that the comfort-weave upholstery wears like iron and that someone took exceptionally good care of this car. The trunk is finished with what appears to be the original mat and with the fold-down rear seat, there's a surprising amount of room in this fastback.  ", "  The engine is a correct H-code 351 cubic inch V8, the standard engine on the Mach 1. It's been recently rebuilt and upgraded with a Holley aluminum intake and 4-barrel carburetor under the stock air cleaner, but for the most part it looks pretty stock. The big Ford Blue air cleaner dominates the engine bay, but there are plenty of signs of proper maintenance, including fresh belts and hoses. It starts easily and makes great torque, a muscle car trademark and the rebuilt FMX 3-speed automatic transmission makes for relaxed cruising under any conditions. In back there's a 9-inch rear full of 3.00 gears which make high-speed blasts completely effortless. The undercarriage shows off a recent Flowmaster exhaust system, rebuilt power front disc brakes, fr"], "title": "1970 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "947", "price": "39995", "kilometers": 30850.966, "total_pages": 41, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29049879", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "29049879", "year": "1970", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 V8", "Mileage": "19,174 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
