This 1986 Chevrolet El Camino Conquista was deemed worthy enough to preserve for 32 years and it certainly attracts a lot of attention on the street. Use it as-is, give it some upgrades, or put it to work; at this price, what do you have to lose?", "Thanks to handsome two-tone blue paint, this El Camino looks like a far more expensive car than it is. It appears that the paint is original or maybe an older respray, and it's a combination that works particularly well on the Elky's bodywork, enhancing the length of the body and highlighting the car's unique features. It has clearly been properly maintained with no signs of being a work truck, and seeing anything built in the mid-80s to fit together this well is a surprise. And unlike many of its siblings, this one doesn't have any questionable modifications or upgrades, and it's nice to see all the factory trim still in place. The stainless that highlights the fender wells provides a nice break point for the two tone colors and the band of bright trim surrounding the bed remains in excellent condition. There's also a fresh spray-in bed liner, so you can still put this one to work on weekends if that's your plan.", "The mostly original interior is a real treat, starting with the luxurious-looking bench seat and 2-spoke steering wheel. The instrument panel should look familiar to anyone who drove a rear-wheel-drive GM product in the '80s, and this Elky includes an optional tachometer which is always a nice find. Surprisingly nice blue carpets and smooth door panels add to the well-kept feeling inside, and you'll note that this El Camino is heavily optioned with power windows and locks, A/C, and a tilt steering column. The original radio was yanked in favor of a modern AM/FM/CD head unit in the dash. You'll be pleasantly surprised by how much room there is inside and how bright and airy it feels, despite the close-coupled two-seat body and big bed out back. This is a car that you could easily drive cross-country without feeling like it beat you up.", "The engine is a 305 cubic inch Chevy V8 topped by a 4-barrel carburetor and making a reasonable (for 1986) 150 horsepower. Most of the engine bay looks fairly stock, and all the factory running gear is still in place, more evidence that this car has been well maintained but never modified or abused. A chrome air cleaner adds some sparkle to the all-business engine bay, and it's full of mostly OEM components for reliability and easy service. You could spend a few hours giving it a deep cleaning and really make a difference, but if you just want to drive, it's ready to go! An automatic transmission means this El Camino is an easy highway cruiser, and it spins the original rear end with highway gears inside. A custom exhaust system splits into two pipes for a great sound, and you'll note that the floors are extraordinarily clean, suggesting that this car has never lived in a rust belt climate. Flashy chrome wheels with baby moon hubcaps add a slightly custom look and carry 205/75/14 blackwall radials.", "The day of the El Camino is here, so whether you want to use this one for fun or work, it remains a great choice.

Black paint, a great powertrain, and, well, who doesn't love a brute like this? With go-anywhere capabilities but the comfort and reliability of a daily driver, this might just be the ultimate pickup.", "The first thing you notice is the intimidating black paint job, which makes this big truck look nasty. At once unique and timeless, this truck was never a beater so it still looks quite good. The sheetmetal is straight and clean, and the Chevy's squared-off looks have aged very, very well. Look closely and you'll see the paint is in great shape, with a nice gloss and no areas where it needs attention, and with a simple strip of stainless down the flanks, it looks just the way the factory did it. All the original remains, including the original grille, bumpers, and even the stand-up hood ornament that dresses it up a bit. The bed is protected by a spray-in bed liner and a set of chrome bed rails that really look great. There's also a heavy-duty rear bumper and a sliding rear window provides great ventilation on warm days.", "Gray cloth covers the stock bench seat, and the almost entirely original interior doesn't need a lot of flash to be functional. The lower half of the dash is painted to match the body, which is a nice touch, and upscale door panels, carpeted floors, and a bunch of comfort and convenience options make this as much luxury truck as commercial hauler. The original gauges are big, bright, and easy to read, with a factory steering wheel to help guide it down the trail. It also sports factory A/C with an R134a refrigerant upgrade, plus an AM/FM/cassette stereo down low in the dash. Everything feels well-assembled and tough, which you'd expect from a truck, but it never feels like a working-class vehicle. It's still comfortable enough to use every day.", "With a throttle-body-injected 350 cubic inch V8 under the hood, there aren't many places this brute can't go. The rebuilt engine from LKQ has about 15,000 miles and seems to be almost entirely stock save for the long-tube headers and an electric fan on the radiator. Nicely finished, the engine bay looks like someone's been looking after it all its life, and if this truck was intended to get dirty, someone was certainly fastidious about cleaning it up afterwards. There are no radical modifications, so it runs happily on pump gas, idles well, pulls hard, and thanks to that electric fan, doesn't overheat during slow-speed crawling. There's plenty of torque to turn those big tires, and thanks to a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, it cruises quietly and comfortably and fuel mileage goes from abominable to adequate, which is about all you can expect in a big machine like this. The factory 4-wheel-drive suspension gives it its towering presence, there's a great-sounding Flowmaster dual exhaust system, and with a steering stabilizer up front it tracks straight and doesn't wander like many 4x4 pickups. Factory Rally-style wheels wear giant 32x11.5-15 off-road tires that look great, ride well, and claw through the dirt with ease.", "If you're a fan of off-roading, this is a finished truck ready to enjoy, and even if you just like the look, this one is incredibly civilized.
