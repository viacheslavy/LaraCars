This 1970 Mach 1 is a bargain compared to its big block siblings, so if you're looking for a genuine Mach 1 you can drive anywhere, here it is! With a brawny 351 under the hood, a high-visibility performance look, and an easy-to-drive demeanor, it's the Mustang for guys who love to hit the road.  ", "  Few will argue that the 1970 Mustang isn't one of the best-looking designs of the muscle car era, particularly in fastback form. But before we talk about performance and engines and all that, take a look at the special Mach 1 gear this one wears, including the low-profile hood scoop, chin spoiler, rear wing, and Mach 1 rocker panel callouts. None of those parts make the car go any faster, but they sure look like they do! The bright red paint is a little brighter than the original Medium Red, but thanks to a bare-metal repaint a few years ago, it's in excellent condition. It shows only very light signs of use, but nobody's going to complain when they hear the rumble of the V8 or the black strip running down the center of the hood. We're not sure what color it was originally, but if you're going to drive a Hi-Po Mustang, you may as well show off a bit, right?   ", "  Few interiors look better than the basic black this Mach 1 sports today. High-back buckets wear Ford's patented comfort-weave upholstery which is just that: a woven vinyl that's surprisingly comfortable and helps keep you cool. Matching door panels and black carpets keep it uniformly dressed, although they might be starting to show their age. Ford's twin-cockpit design puts a quartet of gauges ahead of the driver and it sports desirable options like power steering and brakes, a woodgrained steering wheel, and a center console. Gauges are original and operational, although the gauge faces are a little cloudy and while the original AM radio is still in the dash, it's not working and is due for an upgrade. It shows well overall, further proof that the comfort-weave upholstery wears like iron and that someone took exceptionally good care of this car. The trunk is finished with what appears to be the original mat and with the fold-down rear seat, there's a surprising amount of room in this fastback.  ", "  The engine is a correct H-code 351 cubic inch V8, the standard engine on the Mach 1. It's been recently rebuilt and upgraded with a Holley aluminum intake and 4-barrel carburetor under the stock air cleaner, but for the most part it looks pretty stock. The big Ford Blue air cleaner dominates the engine bay, but there are plenty of signs of proper maintenance, including fresh belts and hoses. It starts easily and makes great torque, a muscle car trademark and the rebuilt FMX 3-speed automatic transmission makes for relaxed cruising under any conditions. In back there's a 9-inch rear full of 3.00 gears which make high-speed blasts completely effortless. The undercarriage shows off a recent Flowmaster exhaust system, rebuilt power front disc brakes, fr"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars - Phoenix", "title": "1970 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "", "price": "34995", "kilometers": 30850.966, "total_pages": 12, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/34846668", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "34846668", "year": "1970", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "19,174 miles", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Stock #": "0020-PHX", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Red"}},

"mileage": "69624", "description": ["Worldwide Vintage Autos is pleased to present this 1968 Ford Mustang.  HISTORY  The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967-68 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and overhead consoles were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the installation of the accessory atop the steering column. The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released, and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.

This 1968 Ford Mustang checks all the right boxes with its 289 V8 and premium presentation.  But really, you already wanted it just because how something this cool is so easily within reach.  ", "  A red Mustang is always in-demand, but this one is memorable for so much more.  This is the midpoint in the first generation where everything was given some sleeker and longer design elements, but it's still instantly recognizable as an original pony car.  You see it in the deeper C-channel along the profile and the concave tail panel.  And more than just that year's styling makes this one a standout.  For example, the black vinyl roof is the perfect way to signal period-correct premium.  Plus, the fog lights and GT wheel covers are great sporty touches that we all recognize.  And we especially like this car's story.  If you look at the trim tag, this has a sales district of DSO 22 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that's Charlotte, NC.  So over half a century later, and this car is still being sold out of its hometown area.  ", "  Inside, the black vinyl bucket seats do a great job with matching the exterior roof.  It looks great and retains the nice ribbed pattern that's repeated in the back seat and on the door panels. The driver gets the improved round gauge package that came on later versions of the first-gen Mustangs, and ahead of that, we are delighted to see no one has traded the original premium steering wheel for an aftermarket unit. The whole interior follows this car's period-correct and premium feelings.  In fact, the only major component that did not come from the factory is the AM/FM radio.  This upgrade to a more versatile digital tuner and iPod input blends nicely into the original knob-style radio opening.  ", "  This is a C-code Mustang, and so you get Ford's 289 cubic-inch V8 under the hood.  It looks nice with the fined valve covers and long Cobra-style air toper.  But more than just sporty, it runs with an extra kick of performance thanks to and Edelbrock Performer 289 intake and Holley four-barrel carburetor.  There's a nice deep sound out of the dual exhaust that will make this Mustang a great cruise-in friend.  And that feeling is backed up with easy driving features like the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes.  ", "  A complete and distinct icon like this will always be in demand.  It's a desirable classic that's ready to run for the first person quick enough to harness this good-looking pony.

The bold bright red paint combined with custom ghost color changing boss 302 stripes instantly gives this credit at every stoplight. The aggressiveness package goes well-beyond the paintwork. The chin spoiler, SHAKER Hood, and rear window louvers help this one approach iconic status.

The interior is a nice update on the original-style package with custom front seats and a stock fold down rear seat. The Hurst T-bar handle of the 4 Speed transmission is a great place to rest your right hand. Beyond that, the factory gauges are nice and clear, so there is nothing keeping you from enjoying the open road.

Odometer was reset to Zero at build completion - now shows 471 miles. Receipts on file. Very clean throughout. Smart hobbyists, who like actually driving their vintage hardware, are beginning to buy fully-sorted weekend cruisers like this 1969 Mustang Fastback. After all, these classics were built to be seen and enjoyed on the open road, not garaged and dusted with an air compressor. If you're in the market for a vintage American muscle car, this 1969 Ford Mustang Fastback is worthy of serious consideration. Don't let this opportunity at an extremely collectible and rare classic Mustang that's in excellent condition throughout pass you by.In 1969, Richard Nixon was President, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the movie to see, Neil Armstrong made his triumphant mark by being the first man to step foot on the moon, and the 1969 Mustang was completely new from the ground up, sharing only a small handful of chassis parts and carry over engines with the prior model.A lot changed for the 1969 Mustang. It now featured quad headlights up front, with the outer two being more recessed than the inner two that were merely mounted on the grille. It was also now larger and wider to look more muscular. The fastback was now called the Sportsroof. For the first time, this body style sold almost as many copies as the coupe version. The body is now 4 inches longer than before and wider still, giving it a look of a larger sleeker car. The 1969 Mustangs made a name for themselves on the race track both on Trans-Am road courses and drag strips alike. With factory sanctioned racing springing from the BOSS 302 and BOSS 429 models, this era was a high point for Mustang performance.For more information on this 1969 Ford Mustang Sportsroof, or any of our other 100+ high-performance, special interest and collectible coupes always in stock, contact one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales consultants or always feel free to drop by our Bellevue, WA Park Place Ltd campus - where we have over 40,000 sq ft of indoor showrooms filled with the finest cars.
