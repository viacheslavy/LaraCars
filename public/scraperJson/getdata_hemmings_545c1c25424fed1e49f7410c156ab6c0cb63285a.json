In fact, the exterior stays true to the original design, right down to those great wheel covers with the Mustang logo in the middle.

Plus, it follows all the factory-correct specification with the low-back bucket seats, bright trim, and sporty three-spoke steering wheel.  Even the trunk has the correct matting.   In fact, the only non-factory-like piece is the upgrade to an AM/FM/cassette stereo with digital tuner, and that will be tough to sport thanks to its retro knob-style appearance.  In fact, this one has so much originality, even the correct optional factory air conditioning is still blowing cold.", "Since the interior and exterior have not bowed to modern conformity, neither will the engine bay.  Instead of an overblown V8, this cool cruiser keeps its original-style inline-six.  The 200 cubic-inch motor offers plenty of power to move you down the road, and the three-speed automatic transmission and modern Michelin tires only heighten its easy cruising attitude.  When you do take it to car shows, everyone will love to see something this honest.

This 1965 Ford Mustang has weathered the years in impressively good form and remains in solid, stock condition. It's running strong and stands ready to provide its next owner with future chapters of vintage motoring satisfaction that can only be found behind the wheel of one of the most pivotal of all classic cars.", "It won't take more than a quick once over to see how well aligned this Pony is. Mustangs of this era have prominent body contours running their sides that clearly trumpet any unevenness, but there's no issue to be found - from hood to fenders to doors and back, it's an assembly of flush body panels and tight, even lines. The beige exterior hue has held up to the elements, and a nice wet sand and buff would have it looking its best. In contrast to the majority of its brethren still seen on the road - and those numbers are certainly dwindling - the chrome work on this '65 has also either shown resilience or has certainly benefited from shelter, as the bumpers fore and aft are level and unscathed, and its array of body trim shows no serious pitting. You'll also find clear glass featured on all four sides, surrounded by ding-free trim - another decided plus that adds to its still-fresh, road-ready appearance.", "An updated Pony interior sits just inside the doors, with a pair of fresh-looking bucket seats up front and bench seat in back that don't show much evidence of use. Even the quarter trim panels flanking the bench seat remain free of any obvious scuffs - that's often one of the first places you'll find them. The pair of new-looking door panels sit flush in their frame, and while the steel surrounding them can use some fresh paint, that certainly isn't a complex job. Just in front of the woodgrain steering wheel, the dash area remains in its stock configuration, featuring an instrument cluster carrying clear gauges, and a supple, fresh-looking dash pad resting above. The dash has clearly been the beneficiary of some attention, with its smooth expanse of steel covered by nicely-applied beige paint. A compact-looking, retro-styled JVC AM/FM/cassette system also sitting in the dash adds a nostalgic element of its own. The trunk area in back carries the signature Ford plaid lining, straddled by a pair of rear wheelhouses that also show good alignment and no damage from shifting cargo.", "Everything appears to have been left stock under the hood, with a 289 cubic inch V8 sitting between the shock towers and a collection of fresh-looking hoses and wiring within view. The small block is ready to hit the road right away - starting right up and running smoothly, it's paired with an automatic transmission that continues to shift with confidence-inspiring security. Ford was noted at the time for engineering power steering superior to most of its rivals as far as precision and road feel were concerned, and it's on display here, teaming with front disc brakes to give this Mustang the everyday driving manners you'd want when you get behind the wheel. A look at the undercarriage will reveal sturdy floor pans and suspension components that appear to have avoided any contact with the corrosive elements so often found on the asphalt. This pivotal Ford classic sits on set of 14'' stock Mustang rims, wrapped with Toyo Extenza radial tires in front and Firestone FR721 radials in back.", "This 1965 Ford Mustang represents the increasingly rare opportunity to own a sound, road ready Pony car still retaining its stock look.

Midway through the 1966 Mustang model year Ford introduced ther Sprint 200 around March 2 1966. It was advertised as the \"Millionth Mustang\" or \"Limited Edition Mustang\" sale. It was also known as the Spring or Springtime Mustang Sprint 200. This 1966 Mustang was a May production built car  365871 built on May 27 1966 which fits into the production time frame. These options came on the 1966 Mustang Sprint 200. This Mustang has an original 52 year old faded chrome air cleaner appears to be like the chrome air cleaner that came on the Sprint 200. Ford 48 spoke Spinner hubcaps came on the Sprint 200. This car appears to have the original Ford 48 Spoke Spinner hubcaps. Like this Mustang the Sprint 200 didn't have the 3 finger chrome trim at the rear of the quarter panel cove behind the door. The Sprint 200 had a factory console. New trunk mat and tire cover not shown in the photos. The original console is in the container in the trunk. The last long time owner took the original console out because he wanted a modern console with 2 drink holders. The orignal console can easily be put back in. I will take photos of the console to sent a interested buyer. The Sprint 200 also had pin stripping that started at the front fender body to the curve of the cove back to the fender emblem. The last owner had the car repainted but didn't replace the pin stripping. Marti Reports aren't available in 1966. If so I could order it using the Vin and easily confirmed if this was a Sprint 200 or not. I can not confirm it.  I didn't find anything that disqualified it could be a Spring 200.
