When Ford designed the original Mustang, they created a compact, sporty American car that was fun to drive.  It literally started the Pony car movement.  This particular car takes a super clean, stripped down approach to the presentation, and it looks great!", "Fastback styling wasn't that common at the time the Mustang was introduced, but the style has proven popular through time, and looks better today than ever.  This particular one takes a minimalist approach to the look by removing most of the chrome, brightwork, and badging.   There are only two emblems on the car and they were carefully chosen.  First, you gotta have the running Mustang leading the way on the grill, so it's there in all its glory.  Then the gas cap sits nicely in the middle of a blacked out rear panel with no chrome around the taillights, and has only a small Pony in the center of it.  Sweet!  Then, they sprayed the whole car a bright white that really looks sharp.  That includes the bumpers which they treated and painted white too.   It almost looks like a 1965 prototype version of the new Mustangs with their body color bumpers.  A black GT stripe graces the rocker panel, and Torq Thrust wheels give the car a ready for action look.", "Open the door and you will find a black interior, but they left the chrome alone here.  And it looks good that way.  A chrome strip on the door panel compliments the polished door handle and window crank.  The front buckets have a big, bold, piece of chrome which is actually structural.  I mean, why hide it when it can look that good?  The hatchbacks have a nice feature in the fold down rear seat, so you can treat this car like it's a 2-seat sports car if you wish.  Set yourself down in the driver's seat and grab a hold of the Pilot 4 spoke steering wheel, then reach for the Hurst T-handle shifter which falls right to hand.  That deep cowl dashboard has the speedo and engine gauges easily visible in front of the driver, and a glove box off to the right.  The radio is in the center backed up by big Kenwood speakers in the kick panels.", "The engine and drivetrain on this car reinforce the stripped down, ready for action look of the body.  Pop the hood and you will find a 289-cubic inch motor with a chrome air topper and ''Powered by Ford'' valve covers.  It is equipped with MSD ignition, long tube headers, and Flowmaster mufflers.  It sounds healthy because it is healthy.  A 4-speed manual trans is always fun to stir around and is perfect for sporting around twisty backroads or launching off the line at the strip.  Sports cars demand a capable suspension, and you will find that here too.  A Monte Carlo bar helps reinforce the shock towers against the forces generated during spirited driving, and there is a healthy sway bar to help keep the car cornering flat while doing it.  Heavy duty shocks handle the bumps and dips, and front disc brakes provide the whoa power to haul this pony down from speed.    The rubber meets the road through 215/60R15 tires all around mounted on those sweet Torq Thrust wheels.", "Stripped down, powered up, and fun to drive.  Come on down, check it out, then take it home and start having fun with it."], "Exterior:": "White", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "61404"}},

The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a ''1964\u00bd'' by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.

It comes with the engine rebuild receipt, appraisal report and original radio.The iconic pony car lives on! The success of the first year and a half of the famed muscle car drew a pretty big crowd from the beginning and that continued on into 1966. During that year the 1 Millionth Mustang was sold. This feat was achieved in only 18 months from the time the first Mustang rolled off the assembly line. This particular 1965 Mustang has undergone a complete restoration. The black vinyl top of this car is nearly flawless and the car itself just flows like a Mustang should. The interior is in immaculate condition. The 289ci engine had been a staple for Ford at the time and really captured the power that has always been talked about with the Ford Mustang. The Wimbledon White shines and draws your attention to the fine lines and details of the body, all the way from the chrome front bumper to the taillights.

The three-spoke steering wheel gives you that classic grippy feeling you expect from a Mustang, but beyond that, a crisp set of TPI gauges keep you better informed than the factory setup ever did.

The belts, wires, and hoses tell you this is a nicely maintained engine bay, and the sound of the dual exhaust reminds you why a V8 Mustang is always in demand.
