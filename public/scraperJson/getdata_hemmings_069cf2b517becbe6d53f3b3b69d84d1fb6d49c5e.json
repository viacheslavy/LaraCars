A newer coil and alternator help with this reliable total package, too.

Midway through the 1966 Mustang model year Ford introduced ther Sprint 200 around March 2 1966. It was advertised as the \"Millionth Mustang\" or \"Limited Edition Mustang\" sale. It was also known as the Spring or Springtime Mustang Sprint 200. This 1966 Mustang was a May production built car  365871 built on May 27 1966 which fits into the production time frame. These options came on the 1966 Mustang Sprint 200. This Mustang has an original 52 year old faded chrome air cleaner appears to be like the chrome air cleaner that came on the Sprint 200. Ford 48 spoke Spinner hubcaps came on the Sprint 200. This car appears to have the original Ford 48 Spoke Spinner hubcaps. Like this Mustang the Sprint 200 didn't have the 3 finger chrome trim at the rear of the quarter panel cove behind the door. The Sprint 200 had a factory console. The original console is in the container in the trunk. The last long time owner took the original console out because he wanted a modern console with 2 drink holders. The orignal console can easily be put back in. I have photos of the original console and the original AM radio to send a interested buyer.  New trunk mat and tire cover. The Sprint 200 also had pin stripping that started at the front fender body to the curve of the cove back to the fender emblem. The last owner had the car repainted but didn't replace the pin stripping. Marti Reports aren't available in 1966. If so I could order it using the Vin and easily confirmed if this was a Sprint 200 or not. I can not confirm it.  I didn't find anything that disqualified it could be a Spring 200.

This 1969 Ford Mustang is decked out in a great, period-appropriate color scheme and runs with the confidence-inspiring smoothness you'd want in a frequent driver that stands ready, willing and able to get you where you want to go while injecting some vintage mojo into your everyday routine.", "With its Wimbledon white exterior ornamented by a broad swath of matte black across the scooped hood and a pair of reflective C-stripes providing extra flash along its sides, this Pony epitomizes late '60s style and carries a nice shine. It also represents an important chapter in the Mustang's evolution - in terms of size, it's a sort of a middle ground between the more compact models that came before it, and the markedly larger versions that would follow soon after. Take a look from up front and you'll see that the quad headlamps look great contrasted with the black grille sitting at the center. Take a lap around the car and you'll find that the glass remains nice and clear on all four sides and both bumpers are looking clean and show no obvious dings or corrosion. In spite of the nearly 50 years of service this muscle car has seen, those bumpers also still sit impressively level, as does the body itself - in contrast to so many cars of the era that seem to be ambling down the road at an angle - and they're still another element that add to this Mustang's road-ready vibe.", "A refurbished interior - with burgundy seating and door panels that look great against the black of the dash area and center console - awaits you inside. The seating looks especially sharp. Those high-backed buckets up front don't show any telltale creases on their bolsters and the bench seat in back looks to have seen very little use. The carpeting that runs underneath reflects the same condition - no heel marks or stains to be found. Ford went to a more futuristic, double cove dash configuration in '69 and the one here is a nice specimen of the updated design, with its group of oval-shaped gauges in the instrument cluster still readable, and a straight-looking, untorn dash pad sitting above. The optional center console adds a finished look to the interior, as well as offering some additional storage space. A retro-style AM/FM/cassette system sits in the center, just below a pair of vents signaling that this Mustang also comes equipped with air conditioning. The trunk area is nice and tidy, with clean fabric covering the floor and its full-size spare.", "Raise the hood and you'll likely be impressed with the condition of the engine bay. From its walls to the components inside, everything appears stock, yet looks fresh and clean. The blue surfaces of the 302 cubic inch V8 carry a shine that's appropriate for such a strong-running engine, and the factory-correct decal on the air cleaner appears to have been recently applied. The Ford small block teams up with a 3-speed automatic C4 transmission and power steering to make driving this classic Mustang a low-effort proposition. Just in front of it, the radiator looks to have recently been detailed and even the shock tower braces, entrusted with adding rigidity to the front end, are shiny and grime-free. This first-generation Mustang sits on a set of 14'' stock Ford steel wheels, outfitted with Firestone Wide Oval tires.", "If you're itching to put a solid-running classic muscle car in your garage, you should check out this 1969 Ford Mustang.
