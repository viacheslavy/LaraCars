An uncompromising head-turner which never fails to get compliments from all who see her!This particular example was purchased new by its original southern California owner from 'Terry York Motor Cars' of Encino, California on 2/22/1983 and the car still boasts its original owners handbooks and service manuals and was serviced for many years at the renown 'Independent Rolls Royce Service' center of Beverly Hills, CA. The car was originally purchased by a well known southern California businessman the day after his 1983 divorce from his wife and owned by him until being sold to only it's second owner with only 18K original miles in 2010. Although rarely driven, it is important to note that the car has been regularly started and driven locally both it's owner's in order to maintain lubrication of its mechanics.We recently purchased the car directly from it's second owner, with all recent service history and the car has obviously always been covered and garaged. The car is in absolutely prisitne condition throughout, probably one of the finest examples we have ever had the pleasure of owning, and we have owned many. The car was recently fully serviced prior to sale and the car has a clean bill of health for its new owner. It is of note that at no time was any expense spared on this particular vehicle's preventive maintenance. The car has no history of any accidents and a clean CARFAX report to confirm it's history.Finished in this highly striking color combination with a rare all 'Black' interior, which contrasts spectacularly with the dark walnut woodwork, and with all the chromework, including the Rolls Royce grille, in absolutely outstanding and virtually flawless condition, this car would be virtually impossible to duplicate and you will most likely never see another one like it anywhere! The convertible top and it's headliner and the boot (tonneau cover) are also in virtually flawless condition. The original and magnificent burled dark walnut woodwork is also in virtually flawless condition throughout. All the power options and electric windows are working as they should and the air conditioning system blows ice-cold air!This obviously always extraordinarily well maintained Rolls Royce engine runs extremely strong and these cars are not slow - the engine purrs like a kitten, never stalls or idles rough and is extremely reliable - there is plenty of power to pull away at the lights and it cruises at high speeds with absolute ease. The transmission shift is almost imperceptibly smooth and the temperature always remains cool. The Corniche is truly a sensual car that you can drive with your fingertips, smooth and relatively silent, it's thoroughly therapeutic for both drivers and passengers. The delightful precision action of the electrically powered steering column gear change and the ultra light weighted power steering allows one to park this 5000lbs of pure luxury with literally one finger and this long but actually quite slender car is anything but ponderous thanks to it's torque and brilliant turning radius! The ride is truly luxurious from a high riding position and the soft feel of the Corniche is like no other car on the road. This particular model drives particularly well and must be driven to be fully appreciated!The Corniche was Rolls Royce's coupe and convertible versions of the Silver Shadow saloon and was produced between 1971 and 1996. The model was assembled in Crewe and finished in London at the renown Rolls Royce coachbuilders 'Mulliner Park Ward' as a continuation of their 1965 Silver Shadow coupe and 1967 drophead, with the Corniche name applied in 1971. The Corniche coupe was discontinued in 1982 with total production of the coupes (1971-82) being only 1,108 and of the convertibles (1971-87), only 3,239 in total. The car as reworked in 1986 as the Corniche II (with 1,226 produced) and in late 1989 as the Corniche III (with 452 produced). In 1993 the Corniche IV was built (with 244 produced) when production was moved to Crewe after the closure of Mulliner Park Ward and the final form in 2000 was as the Corniche V after which production ceased in 2001.This is one of the last in the original line of cars hand built in the legendary Rolls Royce Crewe factory and then converted at their renown coachbuilder's Mulliner Park Ward, of London England with a quality and craftsmanship that far surpasses that of today's mass produced models with many BMW parts. Finished in this striking color combination and complete with all of its original owner's handbooks, manuals, a full set of original and matching sheepskin rugs, a car cover and its original factory tools in the trunk; this is indeed a rare opportunity to own an obviously very carefully preserved piece of classic automotive history, from a time when Rolls Royce was truly building the world's finest automobiles - a great investment for the Rolls Royce enthusiast or collector or simply an outstandingly striking example of a very rare and unusual Rolls Royce for the discerning luxury classic car owner!Without a doubt you will look long and hard to find a finer example of this rare and very collectible and super striking 1984 Rolls Royce Corniche Drop Head coupe, an always garaged with no accidents and with absolutely no issues example with only 21K original miles!"], "Exterior:": "White", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "21089"}},
