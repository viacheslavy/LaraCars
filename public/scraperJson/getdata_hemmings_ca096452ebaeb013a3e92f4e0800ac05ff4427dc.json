The third and current owner like the two before her is very meticulous when it comes to maintenance storage and limited use. To make sure the car is ready for its new owner the fuel pump and water pump were both recently replaced. In addition the transmission has been gone through and the air conditioning has been serviced and blows cold. All fluids have been flushed and replaced as well as any service work deemed necessary to keep this beauty running driving steering and braking up to original factory specs. All the original owners publications and the tool kit are still in the vehicle. Cosmetically this elegant motor car has original paint and interior. The paint looks great except for some minor lacquer crazing on the trunklid. The soft top is new and all of the trim and ornamentation looks new. Tires look great as well. Overall this car should provide years and years of reliable service and provide the new owner with many smiles per gallon. Considering its age the car is very agile on the road especially compared to many of its contemporaries then and even a decade later.

Few cars can truly be called timeless, but the R107 SL definitely qualifies, and even today, nearly 30 years after they went out of production, they still command respect from the general masses. Despite the very affordable price tag, these cars remain grade-A cars to own and drive, and represent huge bang for the buck.", "Like most convertibles, Mercedes roadsters always look best in light colors that seem to emphasize the car's sun-worshipping status. This 450SL represents everything that was right about the R107 roadster, a near-ideal blend of style and luxury that made it the premier luxury car of the era. The remains in good condition, a testament to the quality of the materials and the care this car has received over the past two-and-a-half decades, although it's possible that the hood has been repainted at some point. Gaps and panel fit are to typical German standards and remain excellent today. Light colors tend to minimize any flaws, but this one has laser-straight flanks, crisply rendered body lines, and almost zero signs of road rash in any of the usual locations. All the chrome and stainless remains bright, and the US-spec rubber bumpers, which usually suffer from degradation in the sunlight, are in good condition and you could dress them a bit to really make this car sparkle.", "Dark blue seats are a sporting compliment to the light blue paint, tastefully rendered in leather, which was optional. There are the usual wear issues on the outer edges of the seats, which is probably totally unavoidable on a convertible with leather upholstery. On the other hand, there's no question that it's original and things like the carpets, wood veneers on the dash, and steering wheel are all in excellent condition. You'll also note that almost everything was standard on an SL, and this one includes power windows, cold air conditioning, and cruise control, in addition to the usual stuff like power steering and 4-wheel disc brakes. We're thinking that the Blaupunkt AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit isn't original (most of these had Becker Grand Prix units) but if it's not OEM it was probably installed when the car was quite new. Overhead there's a dark blue convertible top that fits snugly, and all SLs of this vintage came standard with matching hardtops.", "That 4.5 liter V8 is a wonderful machine, torquey and smooth with a fantastic bubbly exhaust note that sings in appropriately hushed tones thanks to a correct exhaust system. Known for their longevity, these engines are virtually indestructible given proper maintenance, and will happily run for hundreds of thousands of miles with just gas and oil changes. Judging by the under hood area, this one has been maintained if not cleaned, but you can see a lot of new components throughout. A 3-speed automatic transmission was standard equipment on US-bound SLs and it shifts so smoothly you won't even feel it. The fully independent suspension rides extremely well, yet gives the roadster competent handling when the road turns aggressive, and strong disc brakes at all four corners shed speed without concern. And while the elements are always the enemy, this car has clearly spent its life somewhere warm, because it's very tidy underneath, although not detailed for show. Classic chrome wire wheels are a sporty look and wear recent 205/70/14 blackwall radials.", "This is a handsome and affordable 450SL with a clean bill of health that's ready to enjoy.

Our 1980 450SL is one of your best. The Mercedes 450SL is a perfect illustration of the automobile  engineered like no other car in the world. A few of these luxury convertibles have led pampered lives and have very low miles. This all-original 2-owner roadster, with only 50,300 miles, has spent virtually every night of its life in a warm garage. Shows factory Silver/Blue Metallic exterior, Navy Blue leather interior and manually operated soft-top. In addition, a factory Silver/Blue removable hardtop is also included in the sale. Standard comfort options include: AM/FM/Cassette stereo, climate control, tinted windows and cruise control. Powered by a 4.5L SOHC V8 with a 3-speed automatic transmission, this German luxury car will provide all the driving fun you want, and do so in comfort. The silky smooth motor, with Bosch fuel injection, produces 225bhp and 280lb/ft of torque. It also delivers 16/22mpg. The Mercedes has 4-wheel power disc brakes, a limited-slip differential and distinctive factory alloys that carry a new set of Michelin radials. This classic Mercedes 450SL is going to provide someone with a luxurious, open-air ride for less than the cost of a new Miata.
