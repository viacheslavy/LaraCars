Even Enzo Ferrari admitted that it was one of the most beautiful cars that he had ever seen. Of all the E-Types the first of its kind, the Series 1 cars, are the most sought after version of the historic E-Type cars with their \u201csmall mouth nose\u201d and early style taillights located above the rear bumpers which were produced through 1968. Beginning with a 3.8 Liter twin cam 6 cylinder engine carried over from the XK150 3.8 S cars, in 1964 Jaguar decided to enlarge the displacement of their bulletproof twin cam six to 4.2 liters which was to be used until the end of the Series 2 car production. Like many other cars, certain years become a transitional period where a later design is merged with an earlier one, sometimes resulting in a car that has the best attributes of both designs, which brings us to the 1968 XKE. 1968 was the last year for the Series 1 and because of this it was the most refined version. Still retaining the bodylines of a series 1, but adding the upgraded Stromberg carburetors from the outdated SU's, adding the more modern rocker switches on the dash replacing the toggle switches and beginning half way through the 1967 model year, the covers on the headlights were removed for better visibility at night. Overall the 1968 model year is the most refined version of the legendary Series 1 offering the looks of the Series 1 and the best upgrades of the Series 2.", "This 1968 Series 1 OTS is a wonderful example having just 30,000 original miles since new and having just two owners since 1968. Complete with its original hardtop and a Jaguar heritage certificate, this car is finished in its original color of primrose yellow with a black leather interior just as it left the factory. The paint, chrome and upholstery are all in wonderful condition showing that that this car was very well cared for over its life. The matching numbers engine runs wonderfully well and can be driven and enjoyed without worry. The body shows no signs of ever having rust or patch work which really solidifies the cars low original mileage. This is a beautiful low mileage Series 1 XKE OTS that has been well cared for over the years and is ready to be a part of a great sports car collection or to be driven and enjoyed for years to come."]}},

Few could believe a car this pretty was British \u2013 it had to be Italian, surely? And, of course, it went like a rocket and was priced at a just-about-accessible-dream price of \u00a32,000.
