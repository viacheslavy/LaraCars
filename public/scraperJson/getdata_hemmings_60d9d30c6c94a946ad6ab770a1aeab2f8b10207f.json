Handsome, durable, fun to drive, and with great parts availability, they are easy cars to own. Even better, most folks still think they cost a fortune, so showing up in one of these makes you look like an A-lister. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone how little this 1985 380SL really costs.", "Almost everyone in the world can draw one of these from memory, and throughout the '80s, you couldn't go out in the sun without seeing one. Today, however, finding a good one isn't so easy, because they, like most cars of the period, were susceptible to the dreaded tin worm just like everything else. Fortunately, this one has led an easy life with a long-term owner and shows none of the issues that you see on cars that were used for daily transport. The paint was refinished back in the early 2000s and remains in fine order and the sheetmetal underneath is quite straight save for a small bump on the tail panel by the taillight. Fantastic build quality is a big part of these car's appeal and a key to their longevity, and you can feel it just by closing one of the doors. The dark blue paint gives it a sleek, subtle look that ideally suits the 2-seater, a grown-up look that doesn't need to resort to flash to make a statement. You'll also note that the rubber bumpers are in excellent shape and not cooked by the sun and the chrome remains shiny.", "The gray seats are in good shape thanks to the durable MB-Tex upholstery that wears like iron. The natural wood on the dash adds a luxurious warmth to the interior and remains in fantastic condition with minimal wear and none of the expected signs of age. The seats are firm and comfortable for all-day cruising, and supportive enough for the spirited driving for which this car is intended. By 1985, most of these came loaded with every available convenience feature, including automatic climate control (A/C is ice cold!), power windows and locks, and even a rear defroster for the removable hardtop. Heck, even the original Becker AM/FM/cassette stereo is still in the dash! It's also worth noting that the convertible top is in excellent shape and the hardtop seals it up as well as a coupe.", "The 3.8 liter V8 was downsized from the earlier 4.5 liter unit, but gives up only 7 horsepower (215 vs. 222). As a result, the 380 feels more agile thanks to a lighter front end, yet still zips around town with ease and hammers down the interstate at supra-legal speeds. The car has always been properly maintained and the critical timing chain upgrade has already been performance, and as a result, this is an SL will last practically forever if you keep it up. The automatic transmission shifts properly and the car has that same firm but supple feel in the suspension that makes it feel confident under almost any conditions. Familiar Mercedes-Benz ''pie crust'' alloys were chrome plated, which is a nice upgrade, and carry brand new 205/70/14 Michelin blackwall radials.", "With manuals and long-term ownership, this is the SL that you can buy without worries.

The Brown exterior and tan interior on this car are a classic combination and it wears them well. In 1980 Mercedes-Benz revamped its SL lineup of sporting luxury convertibles with the introduction of the 380SL. The 380 was a further development of the R107 chassis which was first used in 1972 by the 350SL and then later by the 450SL. Like its forebears the 380SL was a heady mix of V-8 power refined luxury and sporty underpinnings and it was as a very popular model during its run in the U.S. The 380SL so-named for its 3.8-liter V-8 had a smaller engine than the 450SL and was consequently 120 pounds lighter. The two engines were very similar in performance despite the difference in their displacements. Outside of the engine the 380SL also received a new four-speed automatic transmission which further enhanced distance driving. Suspension meanwhile continued to be the same fully independent setup as in the earlier cars and four-wheel disc brakes remained standard. The 380SL ended production in 1985 at which point it was replaced by the 560SL. With the prices of the 380SL\"??s being less than the 450SL\"??s mainly because of the difference in displacement but with similar performance. The Mercedes-Benz 380SL is a fine choice as a collectible 1980s convertible at an affordable price.

This 1984 380SL is a great balance of performance, style, price, and preservation, and for open-air motoring, the SL is still pretty tough to beat.", "In the mid-80s, wild colors were in fashion, but ever-conservative Mercedes-Benz always got it right. In this car's case, it's beautiful silver-blue bodywork with dark blue hides inside, a combination that has looked great for decades, if not centuries. The light blue respray gives the SL a big car look despite its rather diminutive size, and in a Mercedes, elegance is never an option but mandatory. The light color also emphasizes how straight and clean this one is, thanks to a lifetime in a warm climate and only 94,539 miles showing on the odometer (that's not many at all on a 30-year-old Mercedes-Benz). A dark blue pinstripe offers a bit of contrast and the light colors like this do a much better job of disguising the heavy federally-mandated bumpers, so it looks sleek and trim compared to many of its siblings. There's plenty of shine, but a dedicated hobbyist could really take it up a notch with a professional buff so that the car can live up to the legacy of the three-pointed star on its nose. Someone added a '560SL' emblem to the tail, as well as a center stop lamp, but that's an innocent upgrade that most folks won't notice.", "Most R107 SLs received MB-Tex vinyl, but this lovely roadster wears genuine leather, which makes a big difference in the way it feels. The design is familiar, of course, but that's part of the SL's appeal, and with everything so sensibly arranged and logical, is there really any other way to do it? The upholstery's condition is very good all around, particularly for an open car, and aside from a split in the dash pad, it looks great. Big, easy-to-read gauges were a Mercedes-Benz hallmark for decades and the giant steering wheel makes this car feel substantial when you're at the helm. Features like automatic climate control, power windows, and cruise control mean it's one of the most user-friendly 2-seaters you can own and the lovely carpeted package shelf behind the seats offers good storage space when you're in a hurry. A convertible top stows neatly under the hard boot in back and looks almost new and like all SLs, it includes a removable hardtop.", "In 1980, the SL switched to a 3.8 liter V8, which still delivers the kind of effortless performance for which these cars are famous. They're also quite reliable and easy to maintain, so don't be afraid of owning this one. It starts easily with a familiar V8 thrum from the exhaust and the bubbly idle and smooth torque make it feel beautifully polished from behind the wheel. The engine bay has been maintained over the years and remains clean, and it's full of correct parts, so no worries about deferred maintenance here. The 3-speed automatic transmission has a knack for always being in the right gear, and as always, it's impeccably smooth. The all-independent suspension is supple yet athletic, and while this is no sports car, it doesn't mind hustling a bit on your favorite roads. 4-wheel discs live behind those familiar Mercedes-Benz alloy wheels and carry right-sized 205/65/15 blackwall radials.", "This is a clean, tidy SL in great colors that we can heartily recommend for warm weather fun. Just don't tell your friends and neighbors how affordable it really is! Call now!"], "Exterior:": "Light Blue", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "94539"}},
