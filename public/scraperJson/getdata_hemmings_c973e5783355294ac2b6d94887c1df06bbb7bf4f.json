While production was in high gear for the newly designed 1965 Mustang, the car was honored by being named the Indianapolis Pace Car of 1964. Due to the high anticipation and popularity of the Mustang, Ford started releasing designs early. These were initially marketed as early 1965 models but because some changes were made to the 65 Mustangs this set of cars became known as the 1964 1/2. This car is a nice solid Mustang done in Red with a Black power convertible top. When down, the top is covered with a White boot cover to match the Parchment interior. The paint is in good condition and the body rust free. All of the original style chrome and stainless accents are in place with a great shine. The glass is in great shape with no issues. It has a GT valance in the rear with the dual exhaust trumpets exiting through it. Rolling under all four corners are GT wheels with the Ford Mustang center caps which complete the classic Mustang look.", "The car runs and drives well with no issues. It came from the factory with a 289 V8 and is still powered by a 289 4 barrel V8 today. The air cleaner and valve covers wear the classic Gold paint like they did from the factory along with the 289 decal. The car doesn't smoke and rolls down the road comfortably. The motor is paired with a C4 automatic transmission that moves through the gears smoothly.", "Inside, the car has the Parchment interior which is always a popular choice in these classics. It is combined with a painted to match dash, Black carpeting and a Black dash pad to create a two tone look. The car utilizes all original style components from the t-handle floor shifter to the woodgrain steering wheel. Everything is just as it would have been stock. The only real aftermarket component is the added seat belts which these cars often do not have in place. The gauges are working properly and indicate 76,240 original miles. The trunk of the car is fitted with the correct plaid mat and houses a spare wheel with cover.", "Mustangs are never going out of style so making a purchase like this can never back fire!", "Make this classic American Muscle car yours for $32,500.00!", "NOW REDUCED DOWN TO $28,500.00!"], "Exterior:": "Red", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "76,240"}},
