He drove and enjoyed the car for several years and in the early 90's had the car restored. It wasn't a concours quality restoration, more to get her back into high quality driver shape. Some new leather/vinyl on the interior, a little engine work and new paint in the original  Ice Blue Metallic color. Then, one of life's mysteries occurred ... The car, after only being driven a couple of times, was tucked away, to sit for 20+ years. Many have speculated the cause of this often seen malady, no-one knows for sure why it happens but it does and often it is not kind to the auto. So, she sat for those decades in various garages and most recently in a car port in Middletown. That is where my lead took me...", "When I came around the corner and saw the \"Healey Blue\"/Ice Blue Metallic 3000 sitting there, covered in years of dust and crud, bits of surface rust creeping onto chrome and pitting the bright work, I had hope. Her bones were still very solid. It took us a while to coax her back to running but she did fire and eventually smooth out (as seen by the video).", "Particulars of this car are that she was painted back at least 20 years ago and had some engine work done. The Data plate had been removed and not re-attached. It is in the glove box. The Austin Healey tags on the valve cover are not there. The brakes need to be bled (although after sitting for this long, brake work of some sort would be expected anyway), the bright work and chrome are all pitted, but as evidenced by the numerous photos, they cleaned up very well and do present very shiny and bright. Some of the interior bits are worn and I'm guessing were not replaced as part of the \"restoration\". The leather is a little slack in some spots but does not have any tears  or major creases and folds. She has roughly 87,000 miles on the clock. Runs well, and is super solid.  Oil pressure gauge works and shows about 55 pounds of pressure. Fuel gauge shows full or empty. Lights were working intermittently. There is no rust/rot on her anywhere. As seen in the photos, the before and afters are quite stunning. She went from a tired, dirty classic to a beauty just about ready to get out and be enjoyed. With some in-depth detailing I'm pretty sure you could snag an award with her, just probably not 1st. She is shod in the correct style Dunlop tires and wire wheels.", "Asking price is $45,000, firm, as is. I have seen worse sell for more. The owner plans on doing much of the needed work within the next couple of months, with that the price will start to come up.

The chassis is healthy without any perforating corrosion and we note only a small spot of superficial rust (see photos). The paint shows numerous signs of wear, a repainting should be planned. The door on the driver's side is damaged and a new door in good condition will be supplied with the vehicle for the replacement. The interior can be left as is or restored over time.This vehicle can be viewed and retrieved in Triel-sur-Seine, France.This is a running restoration project, a plateau is necessary for the removal."]}},
