Mismatched wheels and tires, sketchy brakes, engines and transmissions pulled from the Titanic, no thanks. Now, how about this cool 1950 Chevrolet 3100 5-window pickup with the maximum amount of badass allowed by law AND a solid foundation? Yeah, sounds pretty good to us, too.", "Patina is what this truck is all about, and maybe calling it a ''rat rod'' isn't quite right. It's updated but they left the exterior alone, so it rides and handles like something newer but has a fantastic used truck look. It's the perfect way to draw people in and make them just a bit uncomfortable at the same time. On this cool '50 it's everywhere from bumper to bumper and from roof to running board. Trim wasn't a major part of these trucks when new, and there are a few well-placed pieces here to add contrast. The headlamp trim rings and the front and rear marker lights are shiny, as are the door handles on a pair of mismatched doors. There's no shiny paint, just a faded-looking gray primer that's purely intentional and should outlast us all. The bed is functional with weathered stake sides and a simple plywood floor, along with a tailgate that's yet another color. The stance is perfect, dropped but not in the weeds and with a perfect rake. This is an awesome truck.", "Inside, there aren't any vintage milk crates or stop signs, nor are there any LED lit skulls or pinup girls. A comfortable vinyl bench with a new reproduction seat cover is infinitely better for cruising, and black rubber floor mats work well with the working-class look. You're holding on to a thick rimmed late-model steering wheel mounted to a modern GM tilt steering column, and that's a great tradeoff for the original impale-O-matic column and two foot diameter wheel. The original dash holds Auto Meter gauges that look like they were born there, but precious little else. This is still a simple machine, just one that's upgraded to make it reliable and fast so you don't have to worry about actually putting it on the road.", "Pop the hood and you'll find a familiar 350 cubic inch Chevy V8, a big upgrade over the original Stovebolt 6. With the usual upgrades like a 4-barrel carburetor, HEI ignition, and a 12-volt electrical system, it's ready to go anywhere, anytime. The idle is fantastic, especially through the stock exhaust manifolds and glasspack-style mufflers below. Power brakes with a dual master cylinder are far safer than the original floor-mounted setup and most of the wiring appears new. The chassis holds the biggest surprise thanks to a late-model front clip that includes an independent front suspension and disc brakes that all allow for a much better ride, a great stance and reasonable stopping times, with replacement parts as close as your nearest parts store. There's a TH350 3-speed automatic transmission in the tunnel feeding power back to a 10-bolt axle. New shocks help ride quality quite a bit and while it's not detailed for show underneath, you won't find any critical issues that should make you worry about hitting the road. Fresh steel wheels with baby moon hubcaps and trim rings hold fat 205/75/14 blackwall radials that still look like they belong on an old truck.", "Miles of attitude, power, comfort, classic lines and the rat rod vibe, it's an awesome combination!

It is after all a pickup truck!", "The fact that the original straight axle leaf spring front end was retained gives this truck a throw back feel that loses little  compared to a Camaro/Mustang front clip other than turning radius.
