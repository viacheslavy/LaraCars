The biggest note is that the engine has been replaced with a better running example from a similar model. Other big ticket items include new clutch, transmission seals, sway bars, rebuilt shifter, new axle shafts, new tires, new windshield, new fuel pump, new fuel tank, upgraded shifter, and valve adjustments. A full binder of notes and receipts has been included with the car as is the owner's manual and two sets of keys.

The '80s created some outrageous supercars, but few were as recognizable and accessible as the legendary 911 Turbo, or 930. In 1988, Porsche only imported 591 Turbo cabriolets, and for those lucky few, the experience is like no other. The 911 Turbo is a living legend without equal.", "With a fantastic restoration on a super-clean 54k original mile car, this stunning Guards Red Turbo looks every bit the supercar. Finish quality when it was new was exemplary and it has been expertly repainted by the experts at Advantage Autoworks in September of 2014 so it shows spectacularly well. Every single panel is straight, smooth, and beautifully fitted, because build quality on the 911 has always been exceptional. Euro headlight lenses give it a purposeful look and there's simply nothing like Porsche's version of bright red draped across a wide-body 911 to attract attention. Fit and finish are, of course, world-class in every way, and it seems that Porsche engineers were able to cut off the roof without upsetting the car's rock-solid body structure. Heck, even the black rubber components like the massive ''whale tail'' rear spoiler, despite living down south, are supple and rich, defying the sun's rays. You want attention? Even 24 years later, this one is a total eyeball magnet!", "If the gorgeous black leather interior seems to defy the years, that's because it was completely reupholstered by ASM Auto Upholstery (yes, the same ones as on TV!). Contrasting red piping and bright red door panels tie it together with the bodywork but don't get overwhelming. The factory gauges spring to life with a turn of the key, and you'd better keep an eye on that boost gauge, because when it starts to move, you'd better have this bullet pointed where you want to go. Almost everything was standard, including power windows, a power canvas top, and A/C, and the stereo on this car has been upgraded with a Blaupunkt AM/FM/CD head unit that fits like the factory did it and powers a set of upgraded speakers in the doors. The black canvas top fits well, but if you're doing things correctly, you'll never need it, and the front-mounted trunk is in excellent original condition, right down to the original mats.", "Given the outrageous performance potential locked inside the 3.3 liter flat-six, it was popular to tweak them for more boost, but at the cost of reduced engine life. This one remains entirely stock and was completely rebuilt, along with the turbo itself, at 49,000 miles by Louden Motorcar Services, so it runs and drives exceptionally well. And lest you think that a stock 930 engine is no big deal, I suggest you put this one on the pavement and see if you lose your nerve before it runs out of boost; my money's on the car. Turbo enthusiasts seem to prefer the old-style 4-speed manual gearbox and purists will appreciate that the early Turbo's ''frisky'' personality comes through loud and clear; you really need to be a the top of your game to see all that this car has to show you. Powerful cross-drilled disc brakes are there just in case, and it rides on a set of brand new Fuchs wheels wearing new Hankook radials.", "Extensively documented with receipts and maintenance records, this is a Turbo that you can buy (and drive!) with confidence. Isn't it time you owned a legend? Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Guards Red", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "54333"}},

With the same Atlanta owner, an active PCA member, for the past 22 years, who has spared no expense on mechanical or cosmetic upkeep.  Clean CarFax with no accident history; 72,000 original miles. COA.", "Details are slim regarding this 930's early life - it was imported by a Mr. Jurgen Van Beekum and federalized by South Coast Compliance in 1985. In 1992 it was sold to a Dallas Cowboys defensive end who kept it three years until the current owner's purchase in late 1995. The Slantnose conversion and RUF upgrades were completed prior to our client's purchase in '95.  We believe this to be a high-quality, steel conversion based on the twin headlight motors used - Porsche kept no records of factory Slantnose builds in 1985, so even if it is a factory build it would not be listed on the COA or option sticker.", "Speaking of the RUF build, this goes far beyond a badge and some gauges. Genuine RUF parts abound including the sought-after dogleg five-speed gearbox, gauges, intercooler/intake system and more. Complete engine rebuild 11,000 miles ago at a cost of nearly $40,000. The turbo, waste gate and fuel system have been upgraded and it's running stainless B&B exhaust.", "We've driven lots of 930s but never one quite this impressive - boost builds fast, and the close gear ratios allow you to keep the turbo spooled between shifts. It's totally streetable but way more flexible and much faster than a stock 930. It's also remarkably dry underneath.", "A high quality repaint was commissioned in 1996 in the correct A1 Black finish and it remains in stunning condition - always garaged and covered when not in use. Likewise the interior shows beautifully with some ''enhancements'' typical of the period (leather-clad Recaros, door card accents, tasteful but upgraded stereo).", "There is nothing quite like a Slantnose with the right (and very expensive) go-fast parts thrown at it - a truly iconic 1980s supercar that is as exhilarating to drive as it is to look at. This is a high-quality example that's had a caring long-term owner and would be a nice addition to any collection. COA, records and tools included. For more information about this 1985 Porsche 911 Turbo for sale at Motorcar Studio in Atlanta, please call 404-692-5250."], "Exterior:": "Black", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "72281"}},
