"mileage": "71989", "description": ["The year was 1967.  We had our first heart transplant, ATM machines, and the first Superbowl was played between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs.  If you wanted or had a soft spot for the Blue Oval, then you may have been driving a car like this.  Just Toys Classic Cars is proud to present this beautiful 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.  We all know the story of the Pony car crazy and it still continues to this day.  As you will see in the pics of this car, this is one fine example.  The fit and finish are great on this car.  This car did go through a color change about 5 years ago when it was painted.  They made it a special order color Bright Red from it's original Wimbledon White.  If you didn't look at the code on the door you would never know.  They did a great job here.  This is truly a car that will get you tons of attention anywhere that it goes.    The interior on this pony is in great shape as well.  You can see that in all of the interior pics that we have.  It is the original black interior.  This car was not born with a console or the upgraded pony interior.  That being said, it is very clean and nice.  The miles that you see on the odometer are believed to be original.  It may seem like a lot but over the years that is only a little over 1400 miles a year.  We just can not say enough how sweet of a pony this car is.    Under the hood sits the original 289 that is mated to the automatic transmission.  The exhaust is a factory replacement style so nothing fancy or loud here.  This car fires right up and purrs like a kitten.  As we mentioned before, we believe these to be original miles on the car.  It looks and runs that well.    This truly is a car that needs to be in your garage.  With the price of Mustangs going through the roof since the 50th anniversary, this is an opportunity to get your hands on a great car for an awesome price.  We can tell you from experience that it would cost a lot more to find this car and restore it to this level this days.  Take advantage of this opportunity today.  We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms with as little as 10% down and no prepayment penalties.  This way you can get the car of your dreams and don't have to take all of the cash out of the bank at once.  We look forward to speaking with you soon, and we look forward to making you the newest member of the Just Toys Classic Cars family.

With its cool original color combo, correct V8 power, and great original features like the A/C interior, this classic is about getting all you want without sacrificing comfort or conformity.  ", "  It all starts with the Wimbledon White paint.  It's a distinctive color is what we always love to see on Mustangs, and it's the perfect starting point for a very nicely coordinated package.  This classic has all of its trim complete from the form-hugging bumpers, to the correct badging on the fender.  The overall impression is very factory-correct with plenty of crisp, sporty style.  That's why the upgrade to Mag wheels with pony center caps looks so good on this one.  And we know you've noticed the red pinstriping. It not only highlights the great curves of this well-maintained sheetmetal, but also it's a cool preview of the interior.  ", "  Red is an awesome color to have dominating the interior.  This factory-correct hue will have plenty of people sticking their heads through the hardtop to get a better look at the bold color radiating from within this coupe.  In fact, this one was built to cruise with all the windows down, that's why the factory air conditioning is still blowing nice and cold \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it keeps you cool while looking cool.  You'll slip behind the factory three-spoke steering wheel, and beyond that is the larger gauge package that debuted for '67.  This coupe is complete and authentic right down to the correct trunk mat and original AM radio!  But we also know you spotted one nice upgrade.  The cup holder center console is great for added long haul comfort (perfect for an A/C and automatic coupe like this one.)  But purists can remove it easily if you so desire.  ", "  There's even more great original-style features under the hood.  We all love Ford's 289 V8 for the reliable power it delivers, and this one is also worthy of showing off.  That's because it not only gets the main items right like the big blue air topper and block, but also the details are still present, too.  You see it in everything from the tag on the A/C compressor to the Autolite carb on this C-code Mustang.  And a Mustang like this is more than just about being admired... it's meant to be driven.  That why the V8 fires up nicely with a powerful bite from the newer dual exhaust.  Plus, the power steering, three-speed automatic transmission, and the grip of Goodyear Eagle tires are great anytime driving features.

We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this rare Camaro!  HISTORY  The first-generation Camaro debuted in September 1966, for the 1967 model year, up to 1969 on a new rear-wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as a two-door coup\u00c3\u00a9 or convertible with 2+2 seating, and a choice of 230 cu in (3.8 L), 250 cu in (4.1 L) inline-6 or 302 cu in (4.9 L), 307 cu in (5.0 L), 327 cu in (5.4 L), 350 cu in (5.7 L), 396 cu in (6.5 L), 427 cu in (7.0 L) V8 powerplants. Concerned with the runaway success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet executives realized that their compact sporty car, the Corvair, would not be able to generate the sales volume of the Mustang due to its rear-engine design, as well as declining sales, partly due to the negative publicity from Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed. Therefore, the Camaro was touted as having the same conventional rear-drive, front-engine configuration as the Mustang and Chevy II Nova. In addition, the Camaro was designed to fit a variety of power plants in the engine bay. The first-generation Camaro lasted until the 1969 model year and eventually inspired the design of the new retro fifth-generation Camaro.
