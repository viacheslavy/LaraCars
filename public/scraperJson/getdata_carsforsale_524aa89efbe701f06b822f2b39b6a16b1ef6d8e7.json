In 1973 only 252 units would be produced including 180 automatics and 72 4 speed cars. Very under rated at 290hp, the SDs were producing performance numbers that everyone was more accustomed to seeing in 1969 and 1970. The SD-455 has been accurately described as Pontiac's last stand and the last real muscle car. The SD-455 was a thinly disguised race engine: four-bolt mains, reinforced block, forged pistons, forged connecting rods, nitrided crankshaft, even a provision in the block for a dry sump oiling system. The SD-455's cylinder heads were a free-breathing design patterned after the howling Ram Air IV heads, and the cam was similar to the grind used in the Ram Air IV. In 1973, the SD 455 ran the quarter mile in 13.751 seconds and at a terminal speed of 103.56 mph. That was fast. That is outrageously fast and it was done in a street legal car a 1973 street legal car with a full tank of gas (3854 lb. curb weight), street tires and, wait for it . . . automatic transmission.

present this 1969 Pontiac Firebird for purchase. The 1st generation of Camaro's and Firebirds were GM's answer to the Ford Mustang creating the desire for the pony car market. Unlike the Camaro, the bumpers were integrated in to the front end with a very unique \u201cCoke bottle\u201d styling. Although the Firebird moniker lived on in to the new millennium, 1969 models are thought of as the pinnacle of the line.", " ", "The Firebird offered here is powered by a 350 v8 paired to a column shift automatic transmission.  The car fires to life easily and goes down the road smoothly and is nice and tight.  The car has a new chrome power brake booster.  The Firebird has a new power disc brake conversion in the front and the rear and has drilled and slotted rotors.  The car also has power steering and also just had several thousand dollars spent on a new Vintage Air Conditioning system and comes with the receipts for it.  Cosmetically the car presents very well, the paint is in good condition and the black vinyl top is good condition as well.  The headliner, door panels, bucket seats and rear seat are all in great condition as well.  The car rides on 17\u201d wheels in the front and 18\u201d wheels in the rear giving the car an attractive and aggressive stance.  The tires are also new as well as the rims and calipers.

Under the hood of this beauty is the original 350 HO engine that runs like just like it should. A stout and street friendly 320 HP are sure to get this Bird flying down the road. The original 3 speed manual transmission is original to the car and shifts through the gears with out any hang ups. The black interior is fresh and clean with the bucket seats giving it that classic sporty feel. The console mounted shifter is in just the right spot and makes shifting a breeze. The wood accented center console is a nice touch and gives the Firebird a classy feel. With the first Gen Camaro\u00c3\u00a2??s being what people are used to seeing this 68 Bird is a terrific way to get that classic GM Pony car without being like everyone else. Options on this 1968 Pontiac Firebird 350 HO include; AM Radio, Seat Belts, Power Steering, Vinyl Interior, and Radial Tires.For more details on this 1970 Ford Mustang, please call our Louisville Showroom at  812-294-1555, or email Louisville@gatewayclassiccars.com."], "seller_name": "Gateway Classic Cars", "title": "1968 Pontiac Firebird ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "24995", "kilometers": 31978.875, "total_pages": 49, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/37576386", "brand": "Pontiac", "reference_id": "37576386", "year": "1968", "model": "Firebird", "specs": {"Engine": "350 H.O.", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "19,875 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Manual", "Stock #": "LOU1720", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Alpine Blue", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Alpine Blue"}},

It's slick right into the jambs. Glass, rubber, chrome and trim are excellent. Rich black German cloth top. Restored rally ll wheels on radial redlines. Beautiful pearl white interior is completely restored- cushions, upholstery, door panels, dash pad, seat belts, carpet etc. It's mint inside. Has upgraded walnut steering wheel, retro stereo and aftermarket gauges. Trunk compartment is restored. Clean metal was spatter painted, has jack, spare, tire cover and mat. Also a tub with misc new parts included. Motor compartment is meticulously restored. Underside is exceptionally clean. Mechanics have been rebuilt including motor, trans, front ends.  Has great sounding Flowmaster exhaust with splitter tips. Also has sway bars and boxed rear control arms. This car is ready to enjoy right now. Detailed throughout like it's going to a show.

HISTORY  The 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model. The Super Duty engine, Muncie 4-speed, and TurboHydramatic 400 automatic were no longer available in 1975. Due to the use of catalytic converters starting in 1975, the THM 400 would not fit alongside the catalytic converter underneath the vehicle. The smaller TurboHydramatic 350 automatic was deemed enough. The 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models.

HISTORY  The 1964 Grand Prix received only minor appearance changes from the 1963 edition. Those included a revised grille (based on the 1964 Bonneville/Catalina) with new \"GP\" logos and rear deck trim with new taillights, still hidden, again following the shape of the other big '64 Pontiacs.  Revised upholstery trims highlighted the interior, still featuring expanded Morrokide vinyl bucket seats and console as standard equipment.  Engine offerings were mostly unchanged from 1963 except that the standard 303 hp (226 kW) 389 four-barrel V8 gained three 3 hp (2.2 kW), with the extra-cost Hydra-matic transmission. The standard three-speed manual and optional Hydra-matic transmissions were unchanged from 1963, however, a new GM-built Muncie four-speed available in either a wide-ratio M-20 or close-ratio M-21 options replaced the Borg-Warner T-10.
