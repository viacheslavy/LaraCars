This new bold style featured hideaway headlights like what is equipped on this one as an option. This car specifically came from the factory with a 383 but was more recently changed to 440 cubic inch V8 that is backed up by a torqueflite 727 automatic transmission. Besides the changes to the drive train this Charger is very original and even features the optional luggage rack on the trunk lid! Other factory features that this car came equipped with are power brakes, power steering, leather interior, an AM/FM radio, and air conditioning (needs leak fixed). This classic American muscle car is ready to hit the open road and cruise in style! This vehicle is located in our Milwaukee showroom.

If you're shopping Chevelles, you're probably looking for an LS6 Super Sport. If you're shopping Mustangs, you're probably looking for a first-generation coupe. And if you're shopping Chargers, you're probably looking for something between 1968 and 1970. That's a somewhat sad, but beneficial, phenomenon. Sad because it means a lot of great cars just don't get the respect they deserve. Beneficial because a lot of fine metal, like this classy 1972 Charger SE, can be purchased for very reasonable prices. As charming as it is cool, this award-winning hardtop wraps an original 400/3-speed drivetrain in warm blue aesthetics that are guaranteed to turn heads. It's the perfect way for any enthusiast to grab a neat old car and enjoy every aspect of the hobby!    BODY    Much nicer than when it rolled off Chrysler's St. Louis assembly lines, this slick hardtop is the beneficiary of a no-expense-spared rotisserie restoration that wrapped correct Powder Blue 2-stage around a largely original profile. That profile shows no signs of significant repair, suggesting it was a straight, trouble-free canvas before the car's metamorphosis began. Panel gaps are good enough to make painted pinstripes line up exactly right. Fresh chrome and highly polished stainless look great under bright emblems and a tight vinyl top. And overall, this fully sorted Dodge is a unique representation of a more luxurious era of Motor City mayhem!    DRIVETRAIN    Lift this Dodge's long hood and you'll find Chrysler's stalwart, 400 cubic inch B V8 that, introduced to replace the firm's venerable 383, is a popular choice for high performance builds thanks to its big bore, proven strength and excellent interchangeability. Behind that original mill, an original A727 TorqueFlite spins a 10-bolt axle. That smooth drivetrain feeds a fully sorted front torsion bar and rear leaf suspension that's shackled to factory power steering. Cool and confident stops are provided by a correct combination of power-assisted discs and power-assisted drums. Exhaust floats through a factory-style pipe and traditional turbo muffler. And at the corners of the floors, Powder Blue steelies spin G78-14 BF Goodrich Silvertown whitewalls around red-trimmed poverty caps.     INTERIOR    Swivel this coupe's level doors and you'll find a correct Bright Blue interior that reflects the luxurious push of early 1970s America.

This is a showroom quality, ground up restored, Charger that will be sure to please. The exterior is coated a beautiful metallic Plum Crazy Purple with a black stripe. Looking inside, you will find black vinyl bench seats and a solid dash with original gauges. Options include: AM FM radio, power brakes, power steering, seat belts, vinyl interior, radial tires, and chrome  wheels. Under the hood you will find a 440 CID V8 engine recently rebuilt to 1970 Specs backed by a newly rebuilt 727 automatic transmission. With only 70 miles since the restoration it features  Aluminum Intake, New Carburetor, Complete Rebuilt Suspension, Bubble Hood, New Brake Lines, The 1971 model year introduced a new third generation Charger that was characterized by a new split grille and more rounded \"fuselage\" body style. The interiors were like those of the E-body and were now shared by the Plymouth B-body, the Plymouth Satellite Sebring and Road Runner. Hidden headlights were now optional. This Charger is one of the last true Mopar muscle cars produced. Moving into the mid 70s, across the board you would find low rated horsepower, highly emission controlled cars of the future. This Charger will break away from the street light at lightning speeds and is still great for  highway cruising. If you are looking for Mopar muscle car that will not disappoint, look no further. The build quality speaks for itself. To view the car in greater detail, including an HD video and HD pictures, please check out www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our Orlando Florida showroom.

Of course, perfecting that formula takes a rare combination of time, talent and vision, and this stunning Charger 500 is one of the lucky classics backed by all three. The beneficiary of a professional, ground-up restoration, this brutal road warrior is a no-holds-barred classic that's ready to parade the show field and dominate the stoplight. Every piece of the car has been carefully crafted with equal emphasis on performance and aesthetics. And if you're looking for an exhilarating way to enjoy a sunny summer weekend, its legendary Hemi V8, modern Tremec 5-speed and carefully upgraded suspension are all happy to oblige!    BODYWORK/TRIM    After spending most of its life as a solid driver, this clean coupe was the perfect starting point for a high-dollar restoration that decked a hot Hemi big block in savage MoPar attitude. To kick things off, the car's broad-shouldered body was massaged into tip-top condition. Once that metal was prepped and ready to spray, bright red 2-stage laid the perfect foundation for a traditional deck stripe. At that point, the car had been worked into a very nice classic that looked the part and drove the part. However, this Charger's current owner wanted something more than very nice, so he contacted Randleman, North Carolina's Petty's Garage:http://pettys-garage.com/g-19947-eddies-1970-dodge-charger.html and had the car freshened with a blazing coat of Viper Red 2-stage. When that brilliant profile was completely sealed and fully buffed, custom stripes were aligned around HEMI and 426 call-outs. And in early 2017, this Dodge rolled back onto the streets as a flashy, head-turning muscle car that tempers classic old school demeanor with a bit of new age panache!    The 1970 model is arguably the pinnacle of the second-generation Charger thanks to a stunning array of visual cues implemented by the good folks at the Chrysler Corporation. This 500 complements those factory pieces with a few subtle upgrades that maximize its visual appeal. Up front, a wide chrome grille hangs quick-spinning HID headlights above amber, LED parking lamps. Above that grille, a sculpted hood seats black-trimmed turn signal indicators opposite clean glass that's "], "title": "1970 Dodge Charger ", "total_results": "51", "price": "139900", "kilometers": 25520.349, "total_pages": 4, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29889314", "brand": "Dodge", "reference_id": "29889314", "year": "1970", "model": "Charger", "specs": {"Engine": "426 HEMI V8", "Mileage": "15,861 miles", "Exterior Color": "Viper Red", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

This particular Charger is very rare, she has the correct 440 V8 Engine, date code 10-27-72; this is a high performance motor, code E86, which pumps out over 375hp! I believe it to be the original engine; however the serial number is too faded to read. She is also equipped with factory air conditioning, power brakes, power steering and several other options. She still has the original fender tag and broadcast sheet, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve included pictures of, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve decoded the fender tag below. Over $7,000 was recently spent to bring back the beautiful bright blue metallic paint finish, which is the original color! The paint is absolutely beautiful, the interior is super clean, and of course, she drives out of this world! Some of the other options include a sport hood, dual racing mirrors, bucket seats and upgraded Flowmaster dual exhaust! Once again, this is a very rare Charger that not only looks amazing but drives extremely well!Fender Tag Decoder:WH23:Dodge Coronet,ChargerHigh2 Door HardtopU3A: 440 280HP(net) 1-4BBL 8 CYL1973Lynch Road, MI, USA136845: Sequence numberE86:  440 cid 4 barrel V8 (High Performance) 375hpD34:  Light Duty Automatic TransmissionGB5:  Bright Blue Poly Exterior ColorH6X9:  Trim - High, Vinyl Bucket Seats, BlackTX9:  Black Diamond Int.
