This iconic numbers-matching 1968 Oldsmobile has a 455-CID V8 Rocket engine with only 73,600 original miles. This all original survivor was a very smooth and powerful vehicle in 1968 and outputs an amazing 365 HP and just over 490 lb. ft. of torque! What makes this legend so interesting is that the Oldsmobile Rockets made from 1968-1976 tend to be more desirable engines because of their heavier castings, beefier crankshafts, and better flowing heads. This 1968 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight survivor is uniquely set off by its original factory Ivy Green exterior, pristine conditioned matching interior, traditional muscular stance , swooping rear quarters and all of the untouched originality. As you look inside this classic Olds you will notice the incredible condition of the unique interior that looks as if it has never even been sat in, and the attention to detail in the design that is the very reason that Oldsmobile luxury cars had such lasting success.  This Detroit time capsule is complete with 15'' inch chrome Oldsmobile hub-caps, radial tires, air conditioning, AM/FM radio, power brakes, power steering, power seats, power windows, tilt wheel and that vintage cloth interior. This untouched 1968 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight is an American legend and survivor that is sure to incite nostalgia and create many more memorable moments.

Oldsmobile 442s are another true muscle car and Convertibles are one of very low production, with only 2,993 Oldsmobile 442 Convertibles made for the 1970 model year. That\u2019s not many lucky people to have the chance of ownership at any given time, how many can be left? 1970 continued as a separate Oldsmobile 442 series rather than a trim package to the Cutlass models of 1967 and previous years. Power came from the 10.25 to 1 compression 455 cubic inch big block V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, originally rated at 365 horsepower. This example is coupled to the optional Turbo Hydramatic 400 transmission. The last owner of this car had the engine rebuilt, an Aluminium radiator fitted and Wilwood disc brakes fitted all around to enhance the cars already great drivability. At time of introduction, in 1964, and as an answer to Pontiacs GTO, the 442-name meant 4-speed, 4 barrel and dual exhaust. The example we have here is very nice example of a street driven vehicle, the paint, interior and chrome are all at quality level. It drives particularly well and has factory Air Conditioning. Another very rare option is the bench front seat making it a real 6 seater. The previous owner wanted this to be a great driver, we have receipts totaling almost $35,000.00 that he spent to make it that, a few items follow. The engine was rebuilt ($6,993.00), an aluminium radiator installed, the Wilwood Disc Brakes ($4,550.81), 10 Bolt Posi Diff with new axle and diff housing ($2,375.00), new gas tank, super starter, complete under dash, A/C and Power top wiring harness ($981.84), power steering pump, Decoding the Cowl Tag the car was built in Linden, New Jersey in the 2nd week of April and came as a Matador Red car with Black interior. The engine appears to be the original as the stamping on it matches with the VIN number. It has the Rally Wheels and an original AM Radio in the dash but under the dash is mounted an AM/FM CD Alpine stereo with an additional 10-disc CD changer in the trunk. To keep tabs on the engine it has had a set of Auto Meter gauges fitted to follow oil pressure, water temperature and voltage readings. Finished in Matador Red with Black interior and a White Power Convertible top. The top will be replaced with colour of your choice as it has a minor cut, or the price of the car can be discounted accordingly."], "title": "1970 Oldsmobile 442 ", "total_results": "383 .

"description": ["This is a real-deal 1970 Oldsmobile 442 at it's best.  After all, it has the numbers-matching 455 V8, four-on-the-floor, and so fresh from such a thorough restoration that it has award-winning paint.  ", "  You're going to love the paint the moment the sunshine hits this super-straight body.  This is a very well done respray of the factory-correct Bamboo Cream.  In fact, there was so much invested in the restoration, that this received top tier scores for paint and body at Oldsmobile Club of America meet in 2014.  This is the product of a large investment in the restoration of not just the paint, but of course body, and mechanical elements, but there is much more to this coupe than just a high-quality appearance.  The color nicely represents the premium Oldsmobile image, which gives the car a great dual luxury and performance personality it had from day one.  The best example of is probably the dual hood stripes.  They are usually reserved for an aggressive image, but when it combines with the premium black vinyl roof, original-style Goodyear Polyglas tires, and the pinstripes, it almost feels like this car has a subtle two-tone.  But we also know why you love this 442.  These are the sleek kings of the streets, with the fastback profile, bulging quarter panels, force-air hood, twist lock hood pins, and spoiler on the rear deck.  Plus, the nicely integrated chrome rear bumper design was one of the best to ever come out of the '70s.  ", "  The black interior is pure Oldsmobile. The handsome button-pattern buckets have to be this perfect because they attract so much attention. Of course, as an Olds, there's plenty of burled walnut applique on the dash and door panels.  And, when the wood-like appearance is this good, it does a very nice job of adding character to the interior.  There's comfortable seating for up to six, but this is a true driver's car at heart. The four-spoke sports steering wheel should look familiar to any Olds fan, and the factory gauge trio is supplemented by an auxiliary group under the dash. And of course, that Hurst shifter boldly protruding from the floor is a whole lot of fun.  ", "  Under the hood is exactly what you want to see \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a numbers-matching 455 cubic-inch V8.  The engine bay is an impressive time machine that looks like this car just left the Lancing factory.  That's all part oft the investment in this car's care.  The motor was rebuilt only about 600 miles ago, and the condition of it and the whole drivetrain is quite impressive (so don't forget to look at the undercarriage photos!) Those great hood scoops feed the massive air cleaner, and below that is a four-barrel carburetor.  The power makes a sweet rumble it connects to the dual exhaust  (Yep...400+ cubic inches, four-barrel carburetor, and dual exhaust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's a true Olds 4-4-2.)  But real 442 fans know part of the original legend includes a four-speed manual, and so this one has that, too!  It means you get complete control over this massive V8 package.  As usual with an Oldsmobile, no matter how much power it's putting down, it still has all-day usability.  This comes from features such as front disc brakes.  ", "  This is a real-deal (VIN 344) Olds 442 in amazing and distinctive paint.  It even comes with the Olds Club scoring sheet so you can show others that the beauty is more than skin deep.  So this is an award-worthy 442 with the docs to back it all up.  Yes, this muscle car is that good and that rare, so you better hurry before it's gone forever.

For the first time, there was a compact car, the F-85, in the catalog. The \u201cbig Olds\u201d models, Dynamic Eighty-Eight, Super Eighty-Eight, and Ninety-Eight, were continued but significantly redesigned. Underneath new, up-to-date sheet metal lurked a new perimeter-type chassis frame. The rear suspension replaced 1960\u2019s semi-elliptical leaf springs with a trailing-arm coil-spring arrangement. While Olds\u2019s Rocket V-8 still owed much to its revolutionary 1949 forebear, for 1961, it had grown to 394 cubic inches and developed 325 brake horsepower, thanks to 10:1 compression and a Rochester four-barrel carb. The earlier four-speed Hydra-Matic, had given way to a new three-speed Roto Hydra-Matic, which featured a torque converter in place of the old fluid coupling. Despite having the same wheelbase, the 1961 Super Eighty-Eights were smaller than the \u201960s, some five inches in length and three inches in width, making them significantly more maneuverable. Visibility improved, too, such that the driver could see all four corners of the car and thus could park more easily, while the elimination of the windshield\u2019s \u201cwrap-around\u201d made entry and exit much easier.

This car is wearing it's original black and gold 2-tone colors and looks to be a 60's or 70's repaint as it does not have a clear coat finish. The interior is in good condition for the year though not perfect and does appear to be original. This heater works properly, It has the Original AM Radio still in working condition, It has the original service and owners manual as well as the original warranty book and certificate. It has had approximately $2,500 worth of recent work done to the brakes, brake lines, and has new fuel lines. It has also had a recent transmission service. The engine starts easily and runs great(sounds fantastic too) and the transmission shifts smoothly without any hint of slip. All 4 tires are in excellent condition with a matching spare that's never touched the road. All trim pieces ie. badges, emblems, hubcaps, interior and exterior are all there and in very good condition. This is a nice very hard to find classic Oldsmobile.

So when you can find a coupe that has all the right faithful tribute looks, and at an affordable price that leaves some money in your pocket, then this one is just the ticket for the value-mined muscle car enthusiast.  ", "  Code-58 Burnished Gold is this coupe's original color, and it makes Olds/GM fans excited because the 442 often looked the best in this precious-metal hue.  Today the bright paint has a bit of extra luster thanks to a professional respray. And speaking of shine, the newer bumpers have a great mirror-like appearance, and on the Olds coupes of this era that's particularly important.  The front bumper gives this coupe the classic American appearance, and few companies were better at integrating the chrome rear bumper into the sheetmetal design than Olds.  But we really know it's the aggressive details that have you hooked on this.  The dual black hood stripes, correct badging, and the color-match large rear spoiler are great 442 touches.  And Oldsmobile's iconic Rally II wheels.  ", "  From the moment you step inside, you can instantly tell this Olds has a dual luxury and a performance mission.  This is best seen on the bucket seats.  This has a great factory-style pattern that features durable vinyl for the high wear areas and comfortable cloth inserts around the lower and upper portions so you can wear shorts anytime.  And in-between these is a sporty center console with a bold golden gearstick.  There's plenty of period-correct luxury like the burled walnut dash appliqu\u00c3\u00a9s and three pod-style stainless steel gauge faces.  These go great with the upgrades like the wood and chrome steering wheel, auxiliary gauge trio, and AM/FM/CD stereo with aux input.  It creates a total package that is vintage appeal and modern convenience.    ", "  Oldsmobile people know that a Rocket 350 cubic-inch motor is something very special.  Olds manufactured their own V8 engines during this era, and they were quite different than the Chevy version.  These golden blocks are beefy motors that have proven to be virtually indestructible out in the real world.  And we always love to see a period-correct Rochester four-barrel carburetor allowing this V8 to inhale deeply.  The Hooker Competition long tube headers contribute to the power increase as well as help make a meaner rumble out of the dual exhaust.  But even with all the added attitude, this Olds doesn't lose its premium feeling.  With features like power steering and the three-speed automatic transmission, there's an easy drive behind the aggressive appearance.    ", "  A great factory color, all the right 442 touches, and plenty of rumble from the V8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a total package kind of classic.
