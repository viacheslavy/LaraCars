It has a very clean red paint with a very nicely executed bed that is a mix of metal and wood. The wood has been stained evenly throughout the bed and has a matching luggage box stacked on top. This is one truck that was truly built to catch peoples eye going down the road. You will notice the exhaust runs straight out the back through a solid piece of diamond plate aluminum. The wheels mesh perfectly with this truck with the chrome and red lines that match the body of the truck. The tires have plenty of tread life in them and ready to hit the road and take you to your next local car meet. Moving to the interior you will find it is in great condition. The grey leather bench seat is in like new condition, with the door panels to match. The custom gauge cluster and chromed steering column assist in keep the flow of the exterior going, and truly flaunting how nice this piece of American history is.

The 3100 was the first major development after World War II and was one of the most popular trucks on the market. From 1948 through 1953 there were just a few changes to the Chevy 3100, including slight grille adjustments, while the engine gradually got stronger. The 1950 model may have been the most popular of the era, but the 1953 had a few more years of development, making it a bit more advanced. When introduced in 1948 it had a 216-cubic inch engine, but by 1953 it was sporting a 261-cubic inch powerplant with increased horsepower and more torque. This beautiful 1953 Chevrolet 3100 has been professionally restored to a concours level. \u00a0Many NOS parts were used in the restoration to complete this award-winning restoration. The truck has been finished in a stunning Red on Black interior with wood bed accents. This truck was heavily optioned including such options as Side Mount Tire Carrier, Rear Bumper, Rear Corner Windows, Truck Directional Lamps, Dual Fog Lamps, White Sidewall Tires, Accessory Hood Ornament, Wheel Trim Rings, Right Side Tail Lamp, Chrome Bumpers, Front Bumper Guards, Chrome Wheel Covers, Right Sunvisor, AM Radio, Heater & Defroster, and Glove Compartment Light. Powered by its original 261 cubic inch inline 6 and backed by a 3 speed manual transmission, this Chevrolet truck drives like the day it rolled off the assembly line. Due to its high-level restoration, this truck has gone on to win many awards such as The North-East Chevy/GMC Truck Club Truck Meet-First Place, AACA- First Place, and many more. It has also been featured in the Standard Catalog Of American Trucks. This award winning 1953 Chevrolet 3100 Pickup is perfect for the collector who is looking for a post war pickup truck to add to their collection.
