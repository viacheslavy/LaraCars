The second-generation car got its best styling update ever with nicely integrated bumpers, a sleek rear panel, and a mean blacked-out front for Z/28s.  That's why someone took the time to keep this nicely preserved and documented.  It includes all the best Z/28 elements, including the long hood scoop, wraparound chin spoiler, slotted fender vents, and full-width spoiler.  It all looks quite sporty thanks to good sheetmetal and good care to the mostly original Carmine Red paint.  And as a true Z-car of this era, you even get a full stripe package that highlight all the best Z/28 elements all around the car.  And for you Chevy fans out there, you might have noticed that the alloy wheels never look this shiny from the factory.  That's because these correct YJ8 units were powder coated.  It's the first subtle upgrade you'll spot that makes this Camaro distinctive... but it's not the only worthwhile upgrade.", "This car has averaged around 1,400 miles annually, and so low mileage means little seat time.  That's why the red bucket seats look so nice.  In fact, with the full red presentation on the inside coordinating so well with the exterior, this is one of those classic coupes that will have people talking.  But more than just impressing onlookers, you're going to love this for how comfortable it is to drive. The sporty steering wheel and full gauge dashboard gives this Z a performance feel, and you'll love resting your right arm between the center console and perfect-sized shifter.  Plus, you have all the right options like power windows, power locks, tilt wheel, electric rear defrost, cruise control and factory air conditioning.  And while the original AM/FM/cassette stereo is on display, an AM/FM/CD stereo w/aux input hidden in the glovebox means you can have modern tunes in this very vintage atmosphere.", "Under the hood is Chevy's stout 350 cubic-inch V8, and on a car that has been this authentic so far, you'll be happy to know this is the original motor, too.  Survivor people will love the authentic level of detail, right down to the factory decals.  Emissions regulations meant this powerplant didn't always have the best horsepower figures of the Camaros, but the ace up its sleeve was that the motor has similar torque figures to the Mercedes sports cars of the day.  Plus, this one gives you the most out of the V8 thanks to the correct Rochester Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor on top.  Adding to this driver's attitude are features like power steering, front disc brakes, a three-speed automatic transmission, and sway bars front & rear.", "The sale comes complete with a binder full of the right paperwork.  This includes the original window sticker, factory buildsheet, bill of sale, warranty card, owner's manual, and service manual.  So you've got a highly original and significant Camaro that looks great.  Yup, it's a dream car for a lot of us, so it won't be long before it's in someone's garage.

That's you're gateway to a ton of fun.", "The engine bay looks cool with the bright Chevy orange block and intake radiating from within the darkness.  Those call-outs on the exterior weren't lying, and so this is a 350 cubic-inch V8 that gets plenty of power thanks to a four-barrel carburetor.  Plus, this has all the right supporting components like a new alternator, brake booster, and aluminum radiator to keep it all running cool.  But your favorite part of this Camaro is when you look in the undercarriage photos.  Those headers add even more power, and they connect to a new stainless dual exhaust.  It gives this coupe a ferocious growl.  Best of all, you control this V8 and its soundtrack with a Muncie M21 four-speed manual transmission.  This celebrated stick shift has the close ratios to really let you enjoy the performance to its fullest.  Add in power steering and power brakes, and this is a true good-time Camaro.", "The distinct look of this coupe already has you hooked.  And so when you can get a stick-shift, believed to be real-deal SS like this, you know it's the Camaro of your dreams.  Don't miss out, call today!
