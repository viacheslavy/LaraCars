This red demon was recently restored and painted in 2016. With a loud and healthy 350 stroked to 383. Backed by a Richmond 5 speed. That same year Man reached the moon, and the Green Bay Packers won the NFL Championship game. One year before the first Super Bowl. The Chevrolet Chevy II/Nova was a small automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, and produced in five generations for the 1962 through 1979, and 1985 through 1988 model years. Nova was the top model in the Chevy II lineup through 1968. The Chevy II nameplate was dropped, Nova becoming the nameplate for the 1969 through 1979 models. Built on the X-body platform, the Nova was replaced by the 1980 Chevrolet Citation introduced in the spring of 1979. 1966 Chevy IIs introduced an extensive sharp-edged restyle based in part on the Super Nova concept car. In general, proportions were squared up but dimensions and features changed little. Highlights included a bold grille and semi-fastback roofline. \"Humped\" fenders in an angular rear end were reminiscent of larger 1966 Chevrolets, though the 1966 Chevy II and Nova had vertical taillights and single headlights. The \u00c3\u00a2??66 Chevy II sales brochure clearly promoted the Super Sport as the \u00c3\u00a2??Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Super Sport,\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d but the name \"Nova\" was not used anywhere on the body. Front and rear emblems displayed \"Chevy II SS.To view the car in greater detail, including an HD video and 100+ HD pictures please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com or our Denver showroom.
