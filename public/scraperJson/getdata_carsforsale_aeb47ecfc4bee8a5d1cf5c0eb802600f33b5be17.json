But the truth is, cars like this 1973 Mustang convertible are wonderful cars with a distinct style that still says Mustang loud and clear. Add in flashy yellow paint, cool black wheels, and a handsome interior, and suddenly it's a car that everyone will envy you for owning.  ", "  This cheerful Mustang convertible delivers exactly what the Mustang has always promised: affordable fun. The paint was done a few years ago in the proper code 6E Medium Bright Yellow (nice job, name-making guy), and you'd better believe it's eye-catching. It's two-stage urethane, so it'll look good for a long time, and while there are some touch-ups here and there, you can't argue with how right it looks. The sheetmetal is quite straight, a detail highlighted by the black body stripe that stretches from nose to tail. It hasn't been over-dressed with aftermarket hoods and spoilers, so it faithfully replicates what you might have driven off the dealer's lot back in the early '70s. Bright trim on the rockers makes it look even sleeker, accentuating the long nose/short deck profile that made the Mustang famous. The urethane front bumper is in very good condition with no major cracks or splits, while the rest of the chrome and stainless trim has been well maintained and shines up nicely.  ", "  The Ginger vinyl interior appears to be mostly new, and it captures the look of 1973 very faithfully. You'll probably appreciate the lighter color when you're in the sun with the top down, and the combination of Ginger and yellow works well and doesn't look dated. The factory gauges pretty much amount to a speedometer and fuel gauge, but by nestling them deep in the dashboard, Ford gave them a sporty look even in this 6-cylinder ragtop. A newer AM/FM/cassette stereo was tucked into the dash and overhead, there's a white power convertible top that's in good condition and features a glass rear window as well as a factory boot. The trunk is also properly finished with a reproduction mat and spare tire with cover.  ", "  Mustang experts will glance at the VIN and quickly see that this car has an L-code 250 cubic inch inline-6. Now before you turn away, give this car a chance, because the big six is not only thrifty, but it's also durable, torquey, and cheap to insure. It starts quickly and easily and idles so quietly most folks won't even notice it's running. The engine bay is impressively clean with nice details and lots of new equipment, including distributor, alternator, water pump, fuel pump, belts, and hoses, so it's ready to ride. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic transmission and 9-inch rear end with 2.79 gears inside, so it's a relaxed cruiser with pretty good torque. There's more new stuff underneath, including most of the front suspension, brakes, brake lines, and shocks, "], "title": "1973 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "153", "price": "14995", "kilometers": 46076.933, "total_pages": 8, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27242021", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27242021", "year": "1973", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "250 CI Inline 6", "Mileage": "28,637 miles", "Exterior Color": "Medium Bright Yellow", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Medium Ginger", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

Despite the Mustang's massive popularity, it's still possible to get into a vintage pony car for not a lot of cash, as this 1967 Mustang coupe so ably demonstrates.  ", "  Cars don't come much more popular than this handsome code Q Brittany Blue Mustang, and this neat little coupe offers a lot of pony car for the money. The paint shines up rather nicely and has a wonderful vintage patina that works well on an old Mustang, which, as everyone knows, was heavily revised for 1967. However, America's favorite pony car lost none of its classic good looks and with this car living in the same family since it was new, you know that it's had a pretty good life. Good gaps, straight sheetmetal, and crisp details like the crease that runs from the headlights to the quarter panel scoops all make this car look like it should cost thousands more than it does. There are no body mods, so it still wears a factory hood and Brittany Blue is indeed this car's original color. Nice chrome bumpers and the bright trim along the rocker panels add a lot of interest and the matching blue vinyl top is in very good condition, adding a slightly formal look.  ", "  Remarkably, the interior appears to be almost entirely original and still in good condition. Sure, there's some discoloration and some evidence that it's been driven, but it's good enough that it's worth preserving rather than replacing parts. The driver's door panel shows the most wear, obviously, but it's right on the cusp of needing to be replaced, so we'll let the next owner decide how to proceed: originality or perfection? Fortunately, Mustang parts are insanely affordable, so no matter what you decide to do, it won't destroy your budget. This '67 also features factory air, which was finally integrated into the dash instead of tacked on, and the floor-shifted automatic transmission makes the Mustang feel sporty. Original instrumentation is in nice condition with only minor fading and the entertainment system was upgraded to an AM/FM/cassette head unit some years ago. The back seat is extremely well preserved and the trunk offers a correct mat for an OEM look.  ", "  Ford's rev-happy 289 cubic inch V8 provides plenty of power in the relatively lightweight coupe. The C-code in the VIN denotes a 2-barrel carburetor, so it's reasonably economical to run, too. This particular engine is a rebuilt replacement that was installed in 1997, but it's quite stock and runs great. There's still a 2-barrel carburetor under the stock air cleaner and factory exhaust manifolds ensure that it's quiet and comfortable. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic and with tall 2.80 gears in the 8-inch rear end, this is a great choice for your next road trip. The underside is unrestored and a bit grungy, but we all know trailer queens are no fun and this just means you can get in and go without"], "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "153", "price": "14995", "kilometers": 28569.404, "total_pages": 8, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241907", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241907", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "17,756 miles", "Exterior Color": "Blue", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Blue", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
