The headliner is done in the light blue and is also very nice for its age.  Looking at the dash it all appears stock, and the dash lights are working.  The AC is mounted under the dash and is also working.", "Finally, we will look at the driveline of the Ford.  Under the hood it's been upgraded to a 302 Engine that's set up with a Ford Intake and AutoLite Carb.  It's dressed in stock style valve covers and breather.

Their prized project combined the sensibilities of a sports car with the convenience of seating for four, and the result was such a success that the Mustang carved out an entirely new niche on the automotive landscape - the Pony Car. This 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang convertible was there from the beginning of all that euphoria and now, more than a half century later, it's ready to provide plenty of enjoyment on the road to go along with its direct link to that pivotal time.", "Clad in its original shade of Pagoda green that sits underneath a very solid clearcoat, this Mustang provides visual evidence as to why Ford scored such a decided victory. It's compact, yet not cramped ... sporty, yet not at all ostentatious. Its long hood and short deck lid became a hallmark of the classic muscle cars that would follow, but at the time of its release, it was a design that boldly defied the norm. The finishing touches on this Pony have all been carefully looked after, so you'll find its bumpers both fore and aft sitting appropriately level and sporting clean chrome, its body alignment impressively tight and even, and its trim - from headlight to taillight casings - all representing well. Should you find yourself out on the road enjoying an open-air motoring session and the skies above you turn dark, there's no need to worry - the power black convertible top is in fine condition and raises easily into place to protect you from inclement weather.", "There's a very clean black vinyl interior sitting inside the doors and, from the looks of things, it's been well sheltered to keep it out of reach of the sun's harmful influence, so its upgraded Pony furnishings all look great. The low-backed bucket seats up front don't appear to have seen much use, and an expanse of clean black carpeting, punctuated by Pony floor mats up front, sits just underneath. Despite the Mustang's modest size, you'll find an unexpected amount of legroom in back. The dash area looks great, even for a restored classic. The instrument cluster is occupied by a crystal-clear speedometer and a pair of gauges to each side that sport very fresh looking silver frames, joined by a pair of aftermarket oil and water temperature gauges just below. An underdash air conditioning system has been added with an upgraded compressor running on R134a. And in back, the trunk area looks straight and the signature Ford plaid lining leaves enough exposed steel to see that the trunk floors and inner wheelhouses are well aligned and solid.", "You'll find a very clean engine compartment underneath the hood, with a smooth-running 260-cubic inch V8 sitting front and center with a chrome air cleaner on top, surrounded by fresh-looking hoses, belts and clean components. You can read every word on the oil filter sitting below - a strong indication that the gaskets just above are fresh and doing their job. The engine pairs with a 3-speed automatic C4 renowned for its durability to make for a low-effort and dependable drive train. When this Mustang debuted, front disc brakes weren't a given, but they're on board here to provide fade-resistant braking. A look underneath will reveal a reassuringly sturdy undercarriage with new-looking floor pans, suspension components and dual exhaust system. This Ford classic sits on a set of 15'' stock Mustang rims outfitted with Arizonian Silver Edition III tires.", "It's the car that started an automotive movement, and you don't often find examples as clean as this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible.

The body all appears to be rock solid and has good fit of all the panels.  It's covered in the Lime Gold paint scheme that looks great in the jams and is accented by the White Top.  The paint has been buffed and polished to a beautiful finish.  When restored, new bumpers were installed.  Also, the emblems, bezels, grill, handles and other chrome and stainless is either new or in great condition.  All the glass is in great condition as well with the vent windows having been changed.

Looking at the dash it all appears stock with the factory gauges with working speedo and gas gauge.  The oil pressure, temp and amp gauges are also working.  This Mustang has the top boot for when the top is down.", "Finally, we will get to the driveline of the Ford.  Under the hood it's all painted correct with the black inner fenders and firewall.

The body is straight down the sides and all the door, hood, and trunk gaps are great.  Also, the fit of the all the panels to the door and hood are excellent.  Everything is covered in the Nightmist Blue paint that is the factory color and it has been buffed and polished to a mirror finish that's slick as a ribbon.

All the stainless is in great condition from the window trim to the rocker trim.  You'll notice the front windshield appears replaced with a new seal installed.  The rest of the glass is in great condition and new door weather-stripping has been installed.  To finish off the look it's sitting on a set of Magnum wheels with new Red Line Tires.", "Next, we will look at the interior of the Fastback.

Also, the seat covers are new and all the padding is great.  The carpet is done in black and has been replaced along with the seal plates.  Looking at the headliner it's also been replaced and it has a great fit.  All the interior lights are working along with the emergency brake and horn.  As you look at the dash you'll see it has the 140 Speedo that's working.  Also, all the other gauges are working along with the signals and lights.  This being a 2+2 it has the fold down rear seat, and it also has seat belts front and back.  Inside the trunk you'll see new weather stripping and it has a trunk mat, floors mats, and a spare.", "Finally, we will get to the driveline of this Ford.
