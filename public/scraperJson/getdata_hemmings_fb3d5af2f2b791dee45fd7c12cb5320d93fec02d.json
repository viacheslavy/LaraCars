Without a lot of mass to push around, the built 302 under the hood is a massive over-achiever to make this neat little coupe a very dangerous adversary on the streets.", "The little Falcon gets big props for going all-in with the bright yellow paint job. If you squint just a bit, you can definitely see signs of the first-generation Mustang in its sheetmetal, particularly from the rear \u00be view, but the truth is that most folks will have a lot of questions about this car when they see it. Fortunately, it'll stand up to the scrutiny with shiny paint over decent bodywork that doesn't let you down. It's not perfect and it isn't a show car, but for this kind of money it's more car than you'd ever dream of getting. Door fit is acceptable, the final cut and buff on the paint brought out a fantastic shine, and with body-colored bumpers, it has a subtle, custom look that really works. A lot of the original chrome and trim does remain in place, and provides a nice contrast to the Chrome Yellow paint, with items like the grille being in particularly good shape. Kudos to the builder for resisting the urge to add stripes, scoops, and spoilers, making this neat Falcon a very purposeful-looking machine.", "The simple black bucket seat interior remains 100% business-oriented without losing its sense of style, New seat covers front and back have a great late-60s look and the compact interior is actually quite comfortable. The instrument panel is a neat-looking symmetrical housing with a wide speedometer in the center and heater controls on the right (note that the heater core is bypassed but the fan works). You can really tell how focused on performance these guys were when they were putting this car together, as even the original AM radio is still in place. The carpets are probably a few years old and show some light fading, but they're in good shape and I wouldn't worry about it. Auxiliary gauges under the dash monitor oil pressure, temperature, and voltage and that shifter is linked to a C4 3-speed automatic transmission that has been freshly rebuilt. No power-robbing options, no weight-adding accessories, just a clean, no-nonsense interior that's ready to rumble.", "The robust and freshly rebuilt 302 cubic inch V8 is a formidable performer anywhere it's installed, but put it in a car with a curb weight of under 3000 pounds and you suddenly have a car with the power-to-weight ratio of a Cobra Jet Mustang. Topped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an Edelbrock intake manifold, throttle response is RIGHT NOW. And you can easily see that a lot of money went into the engine bay, whose satin black inner fenders and chrome dress-up parts, not to mention the Ford Blue engine itself, all look awesome. Long-tube headers feed a custom Flowmaster exhaust system with turn-downs just ahead of the rear axle, which is a rugged 8-inch that won't sweat it when you nail the throttle. Brand new chrome torque thrust wheels totally fit the part and wear 215/60R15 radials.", "This cool Falcon represents a load of performance in a reasonably-sized package, all at a very attractive price.

We see machines like this 1969 Ford F-100 rumbling along next to us loaded with tools and ladders, we use them to haul our cars and boats, and treat them as tools more than collectables. That has always been the case, which is why finding older trucks like this is so extraordinary. Offering a few smart upgrades and more than nice enough to show on weekends, this truck is a very affordable way to get into the hobby.", "The current owner spent a lot of time straightening and sanding the panels (and they are very big panels on this truck) to get it to look this good. The glossy black paint is fresh both accentuates the truck's length and gives it an upscale look that never shouts. It's only when you get up close that you really see just how nice it its. When they built these trucks, panel gaps were not a concern, but those on this truck look like they have been trimmed and adjusted quite a bit because it fits together quite sell. The paint is fresh, and again, the goal wasn't trailer-queen perfection but it's crisp and clean with a deep shine that will definitely attract attention at shows. There's a surprising amount of brightwork and trim on this big hauler, and it's all in good condition, including the stainless side trim, the F100 emblems on the sides of the hood, and the big grille up front. And before you go thinking that this is a truck you'll have to baby, take a look at the bed, which has a freshly applied spray-on bedliner for durability.", "The interior has been tastefully reupholstered in two-tone red and black vinyl, again capturing the look and feel of the '60s. Imagine the windows down, the Beach Boys on the radio, and a cool glass bottle of Coca-Cola in your hand... that's exactly how this pickup feels. Wide enough for three across seating, the cab is surprisingly spacious, even in this age of extended and crew cab pickups. Door panels are simple affairs, with a woodgrained insert and a padded arm rest as the small but necessary concessions to comfort. The simple but easy-to-read gauges are arrayed ahead of the driver and seem to be in original condition, so the lenses are cloudy, but that's relatively easy to fix. And yes, you're seeing that correctly: this is a 3-on-the-tree truck, making it a lot of fun to drive. Updating the interior only slightly is a newer AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit (probably should be updated) and a set of heavy-duty Ford rubber floor mats.", "Power comes from a stout 302 cubic inch V8, which is plenty of engine for a relatively lightweight truck like this. It's got some Mustang DNA running through its veins, but it's modest with a 2-barrel carburetor that helps improve fuel economy without hurting torque. Simple stamped steel valve covers and lots of Ford Blue paint give it even more '60s cool, and you can tell from the condition of the firewall and inner fenders that this truck was never a rust bucket. A dual exhaust system with glasspack-style mufflers gives the truck a very aggressive engine note, and the 3-speed transmission clicks through the gears smoothly with light clutch action. Out back, there's a stout 9-inch rear that will easily handle anything you throw at this truck, and the solid condition of the chassis only reinforces that this one lived its entire life in a warm, dry place. Awesome 20-inch steel wheels (look these up, they're very expensive and well-manufactured) with hubcaps and trim rings look almost stock and carry oversized 255/45/20 front and 295/45/20 rear performance radials that look sporty and give it a perfect stance.", "From the sensible '60s, this Ford F100 Ranger is a handsome hauler that's always ready to play. Straight black trucks don't last long, especially the '67-'69 F100s. Give us a call today!"], "Exterior:": "Black", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "40302"}},

Woodstock would forever define a subculture, man first set foot on the moon and the Mets were in the process of doing what was to many, something even more improbable ... winning the World Series. Woodstock has long since given way to Burning Man and Lollapalooza and we don't get back to the moon much these days, but this car has proven itself a survivor, ably carrying on and still very much in action.", "This fastback wears the evidence of its loyal service proudly, but you can still see underlying vitality in abundance. Its factory correct candy apple red still has a shine to it and both the front and back bumpers look pretty unblemished for having nearly 50 years on them. The black vinyl top is in especially fresh-looking condition - deep black and unmarred - and the window and windshield glass is still very clear. Up front, the pair of dual headlights bracket a wide expanse of grille that's still looking good, too. It's an appreciably-sized car, especially for a coupe, with a long hood and expansive doors and that sweeping roofline and chrome trim running the length of its sides accentuate its length, but it has a definite graceful air to it, as well. The low-slung stance, maybe just a little bit lower than it had at its start, adds to that grace and gives it a very road-ready appearance.", "With an interior this spacious you'll want to invite friends along, as this would be a cruising vehicle par excellence. There are big bench seats in front and back, with both having plenty of life left in them and a LOT of legroom throughout. The dash area on this Galaxie differs markedly from most cars of its era, as it's configured with a ''single cove'' design where the driver's area is clearly differentiated from everything else up front. The classic AM radio, still in working order, resides at the left of the instrument cluster, something you don't see often. A set of Equus aftermarket gauges monitoring water temperature, oil pressure and voltage sits just above the transmission to complement the original stock instrument cluster, also functional and bearing exceedingly clear lenses. This 500 came with factory air and it's still representing itself admirably, blowing with convincing force through the vents. A couple of the items that almost always go awry on a car of this age are still very much up to par - the windows roll up and down with no complaint and the doors still close with a reassuring thud.", "The FE V8 engines Ford was dropping into many of the Galaxies, Mustangs and Torinos of the day developed a lot of torque, and this 390 is no exception. Unaided by aftermarket bolt-ons, it develops just under 400ft/lbs of twist, so expect your passengers to be pushed back into their seats when you step into it. Just as important, it still starts right up, runs smoothly and sits in a nice, clean engine compartment.  It's bolted to a C4 3 speed automatic transmission known for its trouble-free performance. Look underneath and you'll see a surprisingly unblemished undercarriage - no obvious dings on the frame rails, rust-free pans and cross-member, and a new-looking dual exhaust that picks up where the stock headers leave off. This fastback sits on a set of 15'' Keystone rims, wrapped in Futura Super Sports that give it a little aftermarket flash.", "Looking for a true numbers-matching cruiser - a survivor that's seen decades of change but still stands at the ready to take you where you want to go in nostalgic style? This Ford Galaxie 500 fastback is for you!! Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Red", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "81486"}},
