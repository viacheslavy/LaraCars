Scalloped lower door panels make it look low and sleek.  Blue pinstriping that matches the interior is a nice touch.

Gauges are easily visible under a dash that helps shroud them from the glare of the sun when the top is down.  The large thermometer between the vents looks rather unique, but is another safety item indicating when there are freezing temperatures outside.  Burled wood dash treatments add warmth and a touch of old world feel.  The removable hard top is a first-class affair.

The four-speed automatic is smooth and efficient in the way it enables the car to run at leisurely low RPMs in top gear while traveling down the highway, but remember, this is a car built to run the autobahns too, so don't underestimate what it is quietly capable of.  The fully independent suspensions and 4-wheel disc brakes have always been designed to instill confidence and provide a great ride.
