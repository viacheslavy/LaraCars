With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

Start with the best-looking one of them all, the 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1. The make sure there's plenty of V8 power, a comfy interior, and restore its legendary Wimbledon White paint to a terrific shine.  Now you've got the perfect recipe for some serious vintage fun.  ", "  This is one of those cars that impresses you in the details. The laser straight body is the perfect canvas to showcase the amazing shine of the paint.  There was a large investment to re-apply the factory-correct Wimbledon White, and you know that the moment you take this car out in the sunshine.  Plus, the bright white helps all the contrasting blacked-out details standout like the full hood treatment, ram air scoop, chin spoiler, louvered rear window, and rear spoiler.  And the full-length Mach 1 red stripe package running down the sides, as well as the one in the rear draw even more notice to this high-performance pony.  Chrome bumpers look great against the white paint, and all the stainless trim has been polished to be sunshine-ready.  And of course, if we're talking about shine, those 15-inch Mag wheels with pony center caps certainly grab your attention.  ", "  Open the door, and the first thing you'll notice are the high back bucket seats that have the cool red stripe running across the neckline.  This aggressive red streak matches the carpeting, and all of this (as well as the center console), seem to have been refreshed over the coupe's lifetime for a very vivid presentation. Plus, this one has the desirable fold-down rear seat for those times when you want to show off this sporty Mustang like a two-seater.  When you sit inside, you'll be amazed at the level of detail, right down to the working clock in front of the passenger.  The woodgrained steering wheel matches the paneling on the dash, console, and doors, which all adds to the upscale ambiance of the Mach 1.  The knob-style stereo keeps the interior looking period-correct, but it's actually a more modern unit with AM/FM/cassette and a digital tuner.  So now you can cruise to more modern tunes in your vintage 'Stang.    ", "  The hood pins look like they are tying down serious power, and that's because it is! The engine bay looks great filled with V8 power.  This Mach 1 has a 351 cubic-inch Windsor V8 as it should, and the block, air topper, and Ford valve covers all have a great original blue appearance.  And we know you love how all the decals are still in place.  But as you dig deeper, you'll discover some nice upgrades.  For example, this is a younger block that now includes a Holley four-barrel carburetor on top.  And we know you'll love the way the header-fed dual exhaust growls immediately on start up.

But even with all the modern features, you still get all the right original pieces like the iconic lines and even the numbers-matching V8 under the hood.  ", "  The idea of keeping the original spirit while adding some nice upgrades begins with the paint.  Red Mustangs are icons, but this one shines a bit brighter than the rest.  A more recent and very professional application means this one has a clearcoat shine that's miles deep.  And because the paint shines so brightly, there was also a solid investment in the bumpers and trim to get the brightwork looking just as good.  The '68 cars were a bit sportier than the earlier Mustangs, and you see that in the deeper C-channel in the profile, concave rear panel, and the deluxe hood with the cool turn signals embedded within the louvers.  This one turns that attitude up even further with cool upgrades like the darkened headlights and MB Motoring 15-inch alloys.  ", "  Inside you're going to spot plenty more worthwhile upgrades mixed in with the right vintage elements.  For example, the black vinyl interior looks great against the red exterior paint, and since there has been an investment here later in the car's life, everything feels fresher than a car approaching the half-century mark.  The Lecarra steering wheel is an upgrade to a smaller and grippier sports unit than what came from the factory, and beyond that is a full set of Dakota Digital gauges that have a modern blue glow.  And more than just performance upgrades, this interior is a great place to spend some time.  The stereo is a modern Pioneer AM/FM/CD/XM unit that has Bluetooth and an auxiliary input for modern music players.  Plus, the air conditioning is blowing cold from R134a so the miles just ease away in cool comfort.  ", "  Under the hood is the original numbers-matching 289 cubic-inch V8 block.  And you can tell from the pictures, this has received proper investments over the years.  This includes performance upgrades like a Demon four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, and MSD ignition.  Plus, there are great components for reliability like the Optima red top battery and a Champion aluminum radiator w/electric fan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so this one can run cool even if you're in traffic with the A/C pumping.  There have been more great investments that you'll enjoy out on the road.  For example, Global West suspension components, the grip of modern Yokohama tires, and traction bars really elevate the driving experience.  Add in a three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes, and you have a pony car you'll easily drive everywhere.

This 1970 Mach 1 is a bargain compared to its big block siblings, so if you're looking for a genuine Mach 1 you can drive anywhere, here it is! With a brawny 351 under the hood, a high-visibility performance look, and an easy-to-drive demeanor, it's the Mustang for guys who love to hit the road.  ", "  Few will argue that the 1970 Mustang isn't one of the best-looking designs of the muscle car era, particularly in fastback form. But before we talk about performance and engines and all that, take a look at the special Mach 1 gear this one wears, including the low-profile hood scoop, chin spoiler, rear wing, and Mach 1 rocker panel callouts. None of those parts make the car go any faster, but they sure look like they do! The bright red paint is a little brighter than the original Medium Red, but thanks to a bare-metal repaint a few years ago, it's in excellent condition. It shows only very light signs of use, but nobody's going to complain when they hear the rumble of the V8 or the black strip running down the center of the hood. We're not sure what color it was originally, but if you're going to drive a Hi-Po Mustang, you may as well show off a bit, right?   ", "  Few interiors look better than the basic black this Mach 1 sports today. High-back buckets wear Ford's patented comfort-weave upholstery which is just that: a woven vinyl that's surprisingly comfortable and helps keep you cool. Matching door panels and black carpets keep it uniformly dressed, although they might be starting to show their age. Ford's twin-cockpit design puts a quartet of gauges ahead of the driver and it sports desirable options like power steering and brakes, a woodgrained steering wheel, and a center console. Gauges are original and operational, although the gauge faces are a little cloudy and while the original AM radio is still in the dash, it's not working and is due for an upgrade. It shows well overall, further proof that the comfort-weave upholstery wears like iron and that someone took exceptionally good care of this car. The trunk is finished with what appears to be the original mat and with the fold-down rear seat, there's a surprising amount of room in this fastback.  ", "  The engine is a correct H-code 351 cubic inch V8, the standard engine on the Mach 1. It's been recently rebuilt and upgraded with a Holley aluminum intake and 4-barrel carburetor under the stock air cleaner, but for the most part it looks pretty stock. The big Ford Blue air cleaner dominates the engine bay, but there are plenty of signs of proper maintenance, including fresh belts and hoses. It starts easily and makes great torque, a muscle car trademark and the rebuilt FMX 3-speed automatic transmission makes for relaxed cruising under any conditions. In back there's a 9-inch rear full of 3.00 gears which make high-speed blasts completely effortless. The undercarriage shows off a recent Flowmaster exhaust system, rebuilt power front disc brakes, fr"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars - Phoenix", "title": "1970 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "31995", "kilometers": 30850.966, "total_pages": 28, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/34846668", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "34846668", "year": "1970", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "19,174 miles", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Stock #": "0020-PHX", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Red"}},

"description": ["This 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 is original where you want it (like the V8), upgrades where you need it (like top-loaded four-speed), and has an all-around great presentation from its restoration.  And since we know you've looked at other Mach 1s, you already know how great a deal this is before we dive into all the details.  ", "  Presented in its factory-correct Meadowlark Yellow, this real-deal Mach 1 is an instant attention grabber.  When you see that even the undercarriage is painted, you'll realize this standout color is part of a re-application during a solid investment in a full restoration.  And more than just the application, we like it because it's a subtle and classy color compared to most Mustangs we see.  But no one will ever mistake this one for a tame pony.  The hood alone is a great aggressive piece with its large scoop, hold down pins, and full blacked-out treatment.  Then add in more features such as the chin spoiler, iconic side & rear stripes, full-length rear spoiler, and this is full intimidation rolling on a set of Mag wheels.  ", "  Inside the aggressive streak is amplified even more.  It starts with the high back bucket seats that have the cool red stripe running across the neckline.  This red streak matches the floor mats, and it really gets your adrenaline pumping from first sight.  Mach 1 packaging meant some premium pieces like the wood paneling, and we all love a proper center console.  But from the moment you slip behind the three-spoke steering wheel, this Mustang is all business.  Directly in front of you is a sporty set of round gauges, including a large speedo and tach.  Plus, we know your right hand will never want to leave the Hurst shifter.  ", "  Under the hood is the original 351 cubic-inch V8, but this motor has been rebuilt for both show and go.  The long Cobra air topper and matching valve covers have bright trim that radiate from within the dark engine bay, and the upgraded blue spark plug wires are an absolute attention-grabber.  This V8 now inhales deeper through a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and so it makes a meaner growl out of the dual exhaust.  Best of all, you get full control over this V8 and its soundtrack thanks to the upgraded four-speed manual transmission.  And don't forget to check out the undercarriage photos.  They are another sign of investment in this Mustang.  We know you'll appreciate components like the newer exhaust and bushings.  Plus, with features like the thick front sway bar, power steering, and Goodyear Eagle ST tires, this is a fine cruising classic.  ", "  You're looking at a real-deal Mach 1 with all the right distinction.  So at this price you know you have to hurry to take it home.
