Power comes from a smooth running German V8 measuring 5.6 liters and producing 227 horsepower and a healthy 287 lbs./ft. of torque.  Plenty of power for this 2 door convertible.  There's something about driving a German car.  Everything fits very well, a nice thud when you close the door and a significant lack of rattles when cruising down the highway.  This was a classic the day it rolled off the assembly line.  Mercedes began production for this model in 1971 and was an instant hit.  Production went all the way through 1989 with a production total over 300,000 units!  1986 saw the introduction of the 560 that would end up becoming the most desirable of this model series.  Power was up significantly, and sales went up with it.  This beautiful example has covered 166,447 miles since it was purchased new in 1987 out in California.  Now on its third owner and with receipts for a top end engine rebuild adding new life to the smooth running V8.  The car spent all its life in California until 2010.  The red paint has a great shine, all the doors open and close very well thanks to a clean history report.  The black leather interior doesn't come close to looking old or worn out.  If you're ready to cruise in style without breaking the bank, look no further and call our St. Louis showroom at 618-271-3000 or swing by for a closer look.

This 1984 380SL is a great balance of performance, style, price, and preservation, and for open-air motoring, the SL is still pretty tough to beat.  ", "  In the mid-80s, wild colors were in fashion, but ever-conservative Mercedes-Benz always got it right. In this car's case, it's beautiful silver-blue bodywork with dark blue hides inside, a combination that has looked great for decades, if not centuries. The light blue respray gives the SL a big car look despite its rather diminutive size, and in a Mercedes, elegance is never an option but mandatory. The light color also emphasizes how straight and clean this one is, thanks to a lifetime in a warm climate and only 94,539 miles showing on the odometer (that's not many at all on a 30-year-old Mercedes-Benz). A dark blue pinstripe offers a bit of contrast and the light colors like this do a much better job of disguising the heavy federally-mandated bumpers, so it looks sleek and trim compared to many of its siblings. There's plenty of shine, but a dedicated hobbyist could really take it up a notch with a professional buff so that the car can live up to the legacy of the three-pointed star on its nose. Someone added a '560SL' emblem to the tail, as well as a center stop lamp, but that's an innocent upgrade that most folks won't notice.  ", "  Most R107 SLs received MB-Tex vinyl, but this lovely roadster wears genuine leather, which makes a big difference in the way it feels. The design is familiar, of course, but that's part of the SL's appeal, and with everything so sensibly arranged and logical, is there really any other way to do it? The upholstery's condition is very good all around, particularly for an open car, and aside from a split in the dash pad, it looks great. Big, easy-to-read gauges were a Mercedes-Benz hallmark for decades and the giant steering wheel makes this car feel substantial when you're at the helm. Features like automatic climate control, power windows, and cruise control mean it's one of the most user-friendly 2-seaters you can own and the lovely carpeted package shelf behind the seats offers good storage space when you're in a hurry. A convertible top stows neatly under the hard boot in back and looks almost new and like all SLs, it includes a removable hardtop.  ", "  In 1980, the SL switched to a 3.8 liter V8, which still delivers the kind of effortless performance for which these cars are famous. They're also quite reliable and easy to maintain, so don't be afraid of owning this one. It starts easily with a familiar V8 thrum from the exhaust and the bubbly idle and smooth torque make it feel beautifully polished from behind the wheel. The engine bay has been maintained over the years and remains clean, and it's full of correct parts, so no worries about deferred maintenance here.

Our many untouched photos say it all...this one is the real deal!  The color combinations on this Mercedes 560 SL Roadster are so stunning and luxurious. The Arctic White exterior finish has maintained (Even after 31 years!) a deep, rich and high gloss like the day it was manufactured and the laser straight lines show the unique style that has made this Benz model so popular to this day! The interior is in incredible condition and the Premium Palomino Leather is soft and supple with no rips, tears or stains. The dashboard has been designed to be user friendly and any trip in this Mercedes will be a total thrill! With no interior smoke odors, we assume a previous non-smoker.  This 560 SL Roadster has so many great features for your driving enjoyment! Ice Cold Automatic Climate Control, Premium Panasonic Audio System with CD Player, Deep Tread Yokohama Tires, Power Windows, Central Locking System, Cruise Control, Dark Brown Soft Top, Halogen Headlights, Front Fog Lights, Rear Window Defroster, Leather Covered Steering Wheel, Removable HardTop, Rear Wheel Drive, Tinted Glass, Light Mercedes Benz Alloy Wheels, Anti-Theft Alarm System, Windshield Wipers with Mist Control, Automatic Antenna, Premium Leather Seats. Carfax Certified & so much more.     This 560 SL has a tremendous powertrain combination! The 5.6L, V8, 272 HP engine combined with its Four-Speed Automatic Transmission will more than deliver all of the power and all of the performance that you will ever need. Your safety is always #1 with Mercede Benz.
