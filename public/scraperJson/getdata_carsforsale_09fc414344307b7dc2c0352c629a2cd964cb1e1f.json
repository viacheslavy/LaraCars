It's the kind of appeal that comes from a real truck that can be put to real use, but still turn heads no matter at a cruise-in or a hardware store run.  ", "  You can instantly see that this Chevy is a cut above. After all, these trucks were often used and abused, but this one has been invested in to erase its decades as a workhorse. The doors shut with authority, and the tailgate leads to a real wood truck bed... It's the kind timeless package that, just like a hard day's work, always gets respect. The bright red paint attracts attention with a more modern luster that looks great in the sunshine.  And with the contrasting white bumpers and wheels, it balances it out the appearance so that the overall impression is a standout old-school pickup instead of too boisterous.  So while others will be showcasing a whole bunch of flash, you'll quietly be gaining fans as people discover the details like how the dealer etched its name across the whole rear bumper all those decades ago.  ", "  It'll be easy to get comfortable inside with a simply and tastefully upholstered interior that is as enduring as the bodywork. Just a simple bench seat with neutral gray vinyl, durable rubber floor mats, and steel door panels that match the dash bring the interior together. A nice two-spoke factory wheel gives you a clear view of the original gauge panel and all your controls.  And an AM/FM/cassette stereo is working fine, but really you're going to love the sound of the exhaust hum piercing the morning mist even more. This is basic and functional, but that's also how it's supposed to be.  You're making a fashion statement that real pickups aren't fashion statements!   ", "  Lift the hood and see a true marvel.  Hardly any of the smooth running 231 cubic-inch straight-six engines are seen in '60s vintage Chevy trucks anymore.  Despite the fact that these anvils of a motor were the backbone for the company's dependability reputation, they get replaced by the small-block V8s.  We understand why this happens and sell plenty of those custom trucks.  But with so many of those out there, it's refreshing to see something this honest.  We're not alone.  Those who want to sneak a peek at your stalwart C10 will expect something of this caliber in the engine bay.  But beyond just appearance, at this is still ready to go to work.  It fires up easily, idles nicely, and pulls strong thanks to the control of the three-speed manual transmission.    ", "  This is the C10 that can make lumber run on Saturday, and then you can take it to the car show on Sunday.  It has been maintained correctly to remind you of a hard day's work, and best of all, you can pick it up at a workman's price.

So while it has the outstanding performance of a modified 383 stroker V8 and four-on-the-floor, you still get the Tempest's affordable pricing.  ", "  Stacked headlights, the pointed hood, and those flying buttress C-pillars make this Tempest look like a much more expensive car. In fact, the pillarless hardtop profile instantly gives this both a sporty and sophisticated appearance.  So while we love the way this one looks, we know there are many of you out there who already see the mesh grill and can see the full GTO clone potential (after all, the internal naming at GM still called it the Tempest GTO.)  Plus, the wraparound chrome bumpers, rocker trim, and iconic Rally II wheels give it an impressive presentation no matter what model you call this classic Pontiac.  ", "  It's hard not to make comparisons to the GTO when you step inside.  The black bucket seat interior with matching door panels, carpeting and headliner has the look of both premium and performance.  In fact, this is an upper level Tempest Custom, so you paid more for it than an V8 Chevelle coupe back in '67.  The interior reflects this nicely with a premium feeling such as the intricate stitching on the seats and the wood appearance of the dash.  The factory-style features are joined by plenty of  nice modern upgrades, including the cup holder center console and three-spoke woodgrain steering wheel. But what you're going to love best of all are the performance upgrades.  After all, a Hurst floor shifter and column-mounted tach are a clear indication there's something special under the hood.  ", "  One look at the tidy engine bay, and you can see it was built for performance.   The Edelbrock topper, matching valve covers, and shiny fan shroud are all great looking pieces, and when you dig deeper, you'll discover the performance of a 383 cubic-inch stroker V8.  This has been enhanced even further with go-fast goodies such as a new Holley 650 CFM four-barrel carburetor, MSD ignition, Dart heads, and long tube headers.  That last piece also enhances the rumble that comes from the dual exhaust, which makes this Tempest sound like its GTO sibling.  You get full control over this performance V8 and its growling soundtrack thanks to the Muncie M21 four-speed manual transmission.  It's the kind of total power package that reminds you Pontiac was at the bedrock of American muscle cars.  ", "  This coupe comes with a huge paperwork file that includes title docs, owner's manual, restoration photos, and build receipts.  So, you get a great classic coupe with an impressive presentation and all the right documents.  When an interesting and speedy classic like this is also so affordable, you know you need to hurry to grab this deal.

Rare Honduras Maroon exterior with black interior and a white softie/cove. Mostly original paint with what we feel is a pretty much unhit body! We got this car from an older lady who inherited this car from her father when he passed away. Her father was a Brigadier General in the United States Air Force, and also a bomber/fighter pilot in WW2 and the Korean War was the 2nd owner of this corvette! His daughter spent a lot of money making this a great reliable car but didn't want it repainted as she wanted to retain as much of the originality as she could while also making it reliable enough to drive everyday. The entire driveline and all suspension/bushings/tie rods/etc... were all redone around 2008 and I have all the receipts to go with the car! Under the hood you will find the Correct Original Numbers Matching 283ci/230hp engine with all correct components such as generator, radiator, valve covers, intake, carb, etc and the correct 4-speed manual transmission. Great running and driving corvette you can get in and go ANYWHERE! The Black interior has all the correct gauges, door panels, carpet, and wonderbar radio. The entire heater ventilation system has been restored and works as it should as do all the gauges, headlights, turn signals, interior lights, and horn. You will look long and hard to find a 1960 corvette as well taken care of and as sorted out as this one! You can jump in this car and use it the way it is with no problems or you can have it repainted and go win shows!

This vehicle is a great representation of this GM classic.  1975 saw a considerably poor year for dealers as fewer than 7.1 million cars were sold.  Adding to this issue was the overall styling evolution of most vehicles this year onward as sleek body lines shifted to boxier shapes. Emission controls were addressed with GM installing catalytic converters on all its vehicles.  While these were placed on Firebirds, it cannot be said that this vehicle underwent any poor aesthetic changes.  The power plant may have diminished from a 455 to an optional 400 or 350, but the Pontiac Firebird still was flying strong compared to its pony car rivals.  This Firebird still retains the cool factor of the mid-seventies and has some kick thanks to a 350 V8 engine and a four-speed manual transmission that rips this sweet ride down the street!  Open the hood to study the extremely clean engine bay and you\u00c3\u00a2??ll be greeted by the familiar Pontiac metallic blue engine block topped with an Edelbrock \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae performance intake manifold! Step back and take in the car with its Formula 350 badging to the period correct rubber bumpers.  A solid set of radial tires are worn by stock racing wheels and gives the car an aggressive stance. Pontiac aficionados can quickly differentiate this Firebird from other years due to the wraparound rear window with the revised roofline.  Speaking of rooflines, this Firebird features a nice black vinyl top that pairs quite nicely with the black and white interior.  Upper white door panels, headliner and vinyl bucket seats are boldly matched with black carpet and dash.  Additionally, a woodgrain panel holds the Pontiac performance instrumentation and proudly conveys that classic 70s style.  Without a doub, this is the car you need to drive at your next cruise or show.  Its stock appearance and valiant red paint ensures that everyone knows you chose wisely.  You drive a Pontiac!  !
