The TR series was much loved here in the USA with Triumph clubs popping up all over the continent. Owners formed bonds with one another and their cars were shown, raced, toured, and repaired together. Today these cars are reminders of a simpler bygone era. This Red/Black classic is a numbers-matching original. Power is supplied via the 2.5-Litre Inline-6 mated to a 4-speed manual transmission. Additional features include semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, 15-inch wheels and tires, pile carpeted floors and trunk/boot, bucket seats, and a gorgeous walnut veneer dash. The Triumph TR6 makes a great first-time collector car, parts are readily available, club support is still good, and you will experience traditional open top British motorcar touring. This beautiful TR6 is located at our Milwaukee showroom. You can view this vehicle in greater detail including HD pictures and an HD video of it running and driving at Gatewayclassiccars.som.

This Triumph has beautiful black paint and knock off wheel mounting along with a rear shock conversion.  This electronic overdrive 4 speed has great running in-line 6 powering this British sports car.  The TR6 is a big car compared to many two seaters of the era, and this helps to give it an air of solidity that can be lacking in smaller alternatives. Certainly, there are far fewer rattles than on something like a contemporary Spitfire. There was no rear seat on the TR6, but the cabin was built for two people to travel in fair comfort. There is plenty of elbow room, a convenient luggage space behind the seats and room for lanky legs to stretch.  The fixtures and fittings are not opulent, but they do have a fair sense of luxury about them. They are traditional too with the dash layout with the large rev counter and speedo dead ahead with minor gauges mounted centrally harping right back to the TR2. The seats are comfortable and durable.  The car\u00c3\u00a2??s size means there is never any danger of getting that traditional bum-six-inchesoff- the-road feeling. Instead it feels more of a grand tourer than an out and out hell-raiser. The steering is fairly accurate and light on the move. Power delivery from the six-pot engine is smooth and refined, and more than sufficient to make the tail squat down when you boot the throttle.  The front anti-roll bar helps make the handling more predictable.  The good feedback from the road to the driver is excellent, so hustling a TR6 becomes a test of driver skill and control rather than a lottery. If cruising is your game, the overdrive is geared to place 100mph easily within your grasp. And there is more than enough torque available to dispatch motorway overtaking with nothing more than a flick of the switch into direct drive.  Options include: Manual top, wire wheels, vinyl interior, radial tires.  To view the car in greater detail, including 100+ HD photos and HD video, please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com.

It has long been the favorite of British sports car aficionados around the world thanks to its good looks, great handling and solid performance. The number of car clubs dedicated to the car attest to its popularity.     This 1969 Triumph TR6 represents the breed especially well. Looking great in green and black, it draws attention without shouting. The engine moves the car with alacrity, humming smoothly under the hood and transferring power to the wheels through a well-matched four speed manual transmission. This is a driving machine, and the whole experience of the car reinforces that impression.     If you're the previous owner of a TR6, and rue the day you sold the car, this is your chance to turn back time. Live those top-down glory days once again. For those of you who have never yet owned a TR6, this is your chance to join the club--literally. You will enjoy the car itself, of course, but you might be surprised at how much you also enjoy the camaraderie of fellow British sports car enthusiasts. It's like a family, and you'll be warmly welcomed.    Don't just stand there on the outside looking in! Call Art & Speed today at (901) 850-0507. We'd love to introduce you to some friends.

This record was then surpassed by the TR7. 91,850 TR6s were built.", "All TR6 sports cars featured inline six-cylinder engines. For the US market the engine was carburetted, as had been the US-only TR250 model's engine. For other world markets including England, the TR6 was fuel-injected as had been the non-US market TR5. The Lucas mechanical fuel injection system helped the home-market TR6 produce 150 bhp at model introduction. Later the non-US TR6 variant was detuned to 125 hp in order for it to be easier to drive, while the US-variant continued to be carburetted with a mere 104 hp.", "The TR6 featured a four speed manual transmission. An optional equipment overdrive unit was a desirable feature because it gave drivers close-gearing for aggressive driving, yet \"long legs\" for open motorways. TR6 also featured independent rear suspension, rack and pinion steering, fifteen inch wheels and tires, pile carpet on floors and boot, bucket seats, and a full complement of instrumentation. Braking was accomplished by disc brakes in the front; drum brakes in the rear. A factory steel hard top was optional. TR6 construction was fundamentally old-fashioned: the body was bolted onto a frame instead of the two being integrated into a unibody structure; the TR6 dashboard was wooden (plywood w/ veneer).", "Besides the TR250 and TR5, the TR6 was also preceded by a series of four-cylinder Triumph TRs: TR2, TR3, TR3A, TR4, and TR4A. TR6 was succeeded by the four-cylinder TR7 and the eight-cylinder TR8.", "The Triumph TR6 is supported by active clubs and reliable service parts suppliers.", "This very nice example has been restored to a very nice, near show quality level. The Interior and brightwork are without fault, the top is new, the wheels and tires are excellent, and the car is rust free with a nicely detailed engine compartment and undercarriage. While the paint is quite nice, its not a concours paint job. Upon close inpection there are a few minor dings here and there, and an occassional run.", "A triple Weber Carb set up, which evidently was used in Europe for Rallying and includes a beefer Cam and dual exhaust, and a Roll bar have been added.", "This is one of the better Tr6's we have had the opportunity to represent.
