This beautiful Camaro RS not only comes equipped with hideaway lights that add to the car's appealing design, but it has also been fitted with a brand new POWER top! It also has an incredible 327 that puts out close to 300hp, enough to allow this Camaro RS to be a joy to drive. This Camaro runs good, and can function not only as an exquisite everyday driver, but is also an eligible show car.The first generation Camaro was a huge hit when it was introduced as a 1967 model, and Chevy's answer to the Ford Mustang was a big success. Our featured Camaro RS is super clean and super sharp, in this great color combination. The paint has a new car luster, and the top and interior are in excellent shape as well. These cars have become increasingly collectable as time goes on, so put the top down and enjoy a piece of Pony Car history!This incredible 1967 Chevrolet Camaro Rally Sport stands tall and proud in the owner's personal collection next to his 68 Camaro RS Convertible, 71 Chevelle SS Convertible, 97 Land Rover Defender D90, 88 Land Rover Defender 110, 96 Impala SS, 89 Jeep Grand Wagoneer, 89 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ62, and 83 Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40.

Clearly someone wanted to build the ultimate '69 Camaro, and pulled out all the stops to create this stunning resto-mod. With a modern tech LS motor under the hood, high-visibility bodywork, and a traditional black and white interior, this is the Camaro we all wish we owned.  ", "  Seriously, if you could have a vintage Camaro built any way you wanted, isn't this pretty much what you'd wish for? The bodywork is quite nicely done and doesn't change anything from the stunning 1969 factory look. The handsome white paint is pretty close to the factory Dover White and with Z/28 style stripes that adds a performance look that's practically expected on an early Camaro. A cowl-induction hood, ducktail spoiler, and proper 'Z/28' badges were added during the build, accentuating the factory styling without calling too much attention to the upgrades. There were no liberties taken with the Camaro's classic shape, and we like the addition of the gills in the quarters, which really stand out against the white paint. Chrome bumpers have been nicely refinished and all the stainless trim has been buffed to a high shine so it really sparkles. It certainly looks fast, but most folks won't know just how fast until it's too late.  ", "  From behind the wheel, there's almost no way to tell that this isn't a beautifully restored, stock Camaro. A black and white houndstooth interior always looks elegant and sporty, and the workmanship is good throughout. The seat covers are older and there's a split on the driver's side, but that's the only real blemish in an interior that's otherwise quite nicely done. The dash features new that look very much like vintage Stewart Warner dials and they seamlessly integrate original and modified components. A factory center console features a custom shifter that now manages a 4L60E 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission. That steering wheel is from a later Camaro but it sure looks right here, and you'll note that this car carries A/C which uses a modern compressor and R134a refrigerant. An AM/FM/CD stereo head unit in the original radio's location powers speakers on the rear deck, but you probably won't ever use it after you hear this thing run. In the best resto-mod tradition, this car blends the best of yesterday and today to create something truly spectacular.  ", "  Spectacular is one word for the sweet-running 5.7 liter LS1 V8 under the hood. The build takes no prisoners, and the fuel-injected aluminum motor grunts out enough power to make anything built in 1969 run and hide. It's also remarkably docile, with thanks to factory fuel injection and careful tuning so it's happy in the vintage F-body engine bay. There are no major modifications, so you get a plastic intake and a modest cam inside, but you'll never get tired of the way it pulls. Neatly dressed in Z06 style red coil covers that give it an OEM look and there's a giant aluminum radiator up front that keeps it cool without wo"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1969 Chevrolet Camaro ", "total_results": "", "price": "42995", "kilometers": 19074.695, "total_pages": 21, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/31114718", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "31114718", "year": "1969", "model": "Camaro", "specs": {"Engine": "5.7 Liter CFI V8 L83", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "11,855 miles", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Stock #": "3660-ATL", "Interior/Exterior": "Black & White Houndstooth / White", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black & White Houndstooth / White"}},

The 1967 Camaro launched the icon, so it's great to see it shining brightly in its original interesting color combo.  It might even have its original V8, too!  But as you pour through the details on this coupe, it's the subtle upgrades that make it irresistible.  ", "  It's hard to resist a Camaro in its original shade of Marina Blue. With nice gloss on this distinctive paint, it recalls feelings of those days when you saw your first Camaro. This is the model that truly started the pony car wars.  It ignited something in you, because the styling was more aggressive, but just as affordable as the Mustang.  In fact, this one has a few interesting upgrades like the cowl hood and the D91 bumblebee stripe that looks great coordinating with the white vinyl roof.  These upgrades combine with the iconic Rally wheels, complete factory trim, and bright wraparound bumpers to be a symbol of how the Camaro stole our hearts all those decades ago.  ", "  One of the best features of this coupe is revealed when you open the door.  The blue bucket seat interior looks great against the coordinating blue exterior hue.  This is the kind of color that could have only come from the '60s, and we believe all the major components are original.  In fact, the only two pieces that are non-standard are the upgrades like the AM/FM cassette stereo and auxiliary gauge package.  Everything else, from the door panels, to the carpeting, to the steering wheel is quite original, and it feels as deep and blue as an ocean.  ", "  The 327 cubic-inch V8 was the heart of the early Camaros, so we love the honest presentation of this one.  With the correct air topper, correct bold orange block paint, correct dual barrel carburetor, and so much more, it really showcases what an authentic classic Camaro V8 is.  In fact, the date code on this block leads us to believe it could be original to the car.  But more than just history, a classic like this was meant to be driven.  That's why it also has great features like the Powerglide automatic transmission and a newer aluminum radiator to keep everything cool.  ", "  Complete with owner's manual, this is the kind of Camaro that gets everyone excited.  After all, it's original in the right places, upgraded where you want it, and absolutely distinctive.  So if you're bold enough, it's time to take home a legend.

With a 383 stroker under the hood, a 5-speed manual gearbox, and 4-wheel disc brakes, this Camaro was built to do more than just look good.  ", "  No other car wears racing stripes as well as a Camaro; they practically define the brand. Originally code 55 Azure Turquoise, the brilliant yellow paint is an outstanding choice for your high-performance F-body. Projecting an image that says it takes no prisoners, the paint looks right on the aggressive-looking Z/28, especially with the usual Z/28 styling upgrades. This car was repainted several years ago and still looks pretty good overall, showing a few signs of age and wear but nothing that'll stop it from being the center of attention. Black SS stripes are almost mandatory, just like the cowl-induction hood and ducktail spoiler out back, all of which give this Camaro traditional good looks that never go out of style. Details like the blacked-out grille, polished stainless wheel moldings, and black vinyl top elevate this Camaro above some of its stripped-down brothers, creating a wonderful contrast between the race-ready Z/28 gear and the high-impact color.  ", "  Houndstooth upholstery is a great choice for a 60s Camaro like this, and the look is purely OEM. Like the dark paint, the upholstery gives the Camaro a great deal of style that suits its price and reminds you why the '69 Camaro is an icon. The carpets are so nice that they're surely replacements, and the carpets, door panels, and even the dash pad appear to be newer. The gauges are cool Auto Meter dials in custom inserts that replace the factory dials, offering both more information and more style. And while it's kind of typical to have a Hurst shifter in a Z/28, note that this one shows five gears on the cue ball, not the usual four. A modern digital AM/FM/CD stereo system fits into the original radio's slot and with a tilt column, it's easy to get comfortable for the serious business of driving. In back, the trunk is bare, but that means it has nothing to hide and you can see how solid the sheetmetal really is.  ", "  That's a built 383 cubic inch stroker motor that puts big block power in a small block package. It dyno'd at 390 horsepower at the rear wheels, so it's definitely got the firepower to match its look. Many enthusiasts prefer the small block cars for their superior handling and generally more nimble demeanor, and this Camaro is no exception. It's nicely finished with some chrome dress-up and matching yellow paint on the block, along with finned valve covers and a big aluminum radiator up front. Long tube headers dump into a cool-sounding dual exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers, and the transmission offers crisp shifts and low effort, not to mention that towering overdrive gear, so it just loafs along with 3.55 gears in the 10-bolt "], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1969 Chevrolet Camaro ", "total_results": "", "price": "45995", "kilometers": 40130.069, "total_pages": 21, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/34184138", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "34184138", "year": "1969", "model": "Camaro", "specs": {"Engine": "383 Stroker V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "24,941 miles", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Stock #": "3856-ATL", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Yellow", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Yellow"}},

And beyond the best look out there, this coupe has plenty of small-block power to make sure it's as mean as it looks.  ", "  They really did quite a nice job of building a Z/28 tribute. The paintwork will easily be one of your favorite elements.  The deep red has the kind of gloss and shine that lets you know someone cared how this coupe looked in the sunshine.  And with the iconic black Z/28 stripes added before the whole car was cleared over, the sunlight rolls off the entire body with a quality and even shine.  This is a great mix of sophistication and aggressiveness that's heightened by the custom cowl hood and full-width rear spoiler.  Plus, those 15-inch Weld wheels add plenty of performance stance as well as some nice shine.  And speaking of brightwork, we love how the chrome bumpers follow the form of the car \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the sharp point in the front to the dip for the license plate in the rear.     ", "  The interior is the right mix of stock components and upgrades to focus all your attention on performance.  The high-back bucket seats, door panels, dash, carpeting, and upgraded headliner create a full black appearance that gets right down to business.  Your left hand will love the Grant GT sports steering wheel, and your right one rest comfortably on the performance shifter.   The auxiliary gauge trio and large column-mounted tach tell you there's something special under the hood.  So while this one has an upgraded AM/FM/cassette stereo, we really know your favorite soundtrack is created by the dual exhaust.   ", "  The bright orange block and shining valve covers look like they are radiating power from within the dark engine bay.  But more than look cool, this 350 cubic-inch V8 has been given plenty of go-fast goodies.  This includes a four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock aluminum intake, large K&N air filter, and long tube headers.  It's a total package that roars to life and offers plenty of performance for the streets.  Supporting this muscular package is a sway bar in front, traction bars out back, and the grip of wide Hankook Ventus H101 in the rear.

With a bold yellow exterior, custom interior, overdrive transmission, and performance-built ZZ4 350 small block under the hood, it's everything you love in one turnkey package.  ", "  This coupe has all the best features.  The Z/28 dual stripes and badging are iconic.  The hidden headlights of the RS package made these the most menacing car of the '60s.  And if that didn't intimidate everyone already, the Super Scoop cowl hood and D80 rear spoiler will.  Plus, this one even has a premium touch with the black vinyl roof.  You can see all of this so well because the Daytona Yellow is such a bold canvas.  And not only is this a correct color for 1969, but the investment in a modern application allows this sunshine-style color to really pop in the sunlight.  In fact, the only thing bolder on this coupe is the brightwork.  Freshly re-dipped chrome bumpers and upgraded 17-inch American Racing Torq Thrust wheels give this iconic American a proper mirror-like shine.  ", "  All those dark accents on the outside were really just a preview of the interior.  You can tell a lot of thought went into this one from the first moment you lay eyes on the interior.  The black bucket seats are correct for the year, but have the feeling of fresh investment.  The same goes for the matching door panels, headliner, and carpeting.  And while the wood paneling on the wheel and center console are a nice factory premium touch, you can instantly tell there are a lot more modern upgrades.  The full bow tie gauge package, shift light, and B&M shifter get your heart racing the moment you come in contact with them.  So, while this one is upgraded with an AM/FM/CD stereo, you really know your favorite soundtrack happens when you twist the key.  ", "  That might be a small-block V8 in the engine bay, but the flame-etched valve covers should be a nice indication that you're about to experience big block performance.  It's a 350 cubic-inch ZZ4 crate motor from Chevrolet Performance.  This juggernaut has been further upgraded further with a Procomp breather, four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock hi-rise aluminum intake, MSD ignition, and long tube headers.  That last one not only adds power, but also contributes to the thunderous sound of the dual exhaust.  And more than offer serious power, this Camaro is also an easy cruiser.  That's why it has power steering, upgraded four-wheel disc brakes, and a four-speed automatic transmission with highway-friendly overdrive.  ", "  Complete with maintenance records and restoration photos, this is a mean muscle machine that offers the best of everything.  And it's ready for the first person to get here and grab this deal.

Seats are a more modern sport seat, which are very comfortable and supportive. There are no stains or tears anywhere on the seats or carpet; there is virtually no wear inside the cabin. The car is fitted with Vintage Air, which blows cold, in addition to a serious sound system \u2013 an Alpine e12 subwoofer with two Rockford Fosgate Punch amps and an Alpine CDA 9825 head unit. All gauges, lights, and powered systems work as they should. The interior, while somewhat modernized, has a retro styling to it and doesn\u2019t look out of place, which we really like.", "Underbody / Under the Hood:", "Underneath, the car looks absolutely phenomenal. Having seen little road use since being restored, the car presents largely as-new. There is absolutely no rust, evidence of shoddy repairs, or anything of the sort. On the road, the car feels great. It starts right up every time, pulls hard, stops extremely well, and shifts very smoothly. There are no concerning noises or tendencies whatsoever. This is a car that you can reliably drive out to a show and enjoy. The under-hood presentation is fantastic. Everything is polished, and really pops against the yellow engine bay.

Take one gorgeous 1969 Chevrolet Camaro, and leave the look alone (because you're not going to do better than this). Add a strong-running LT1 with fuel injection, a 6-speed gearbox, and a pavement-hugging suspension. Finish with a tasteful, yet functional interior that keeps everything that was great about the original design but adds a splash of modern tech. This car totally nails it.  ", "  The bright red paint is the first thing that grabs you about this car, but it isn't the only thing that's impressive. It's nicely done and shows the result of many hours of labor-intensive ministrations with a deep shine and excellent finish work for a distortion-free surface. On brightly-colored cars, gaps are important, and they're pretty darned good here, and the silver pinstripes are a nice alternative to the usual look. Regardless of whether it's a real SS, all the classic SS details are there, from the chin spoiler and blacked-out grille to the proper emblems to the ducktail spoiler out back, so it's got a great performance look, and electric RS headlights are always welcome. The performance look is enhanced by that stock hood with the chrome velocity stack inserts, a ducktail spoiler out back, and a nearly perfect stance. This car nails it.  ", "  The black interior is anchored by a set of custom seats which are aggressively bolstered but also cleverly reupholstered to mimic the original vertical pleats so they fit right in. A factory-style steering wheel is the most visible upgrade, but it's a nice alternative to the original plastic tiller. Updated Dakota Digital gauges monitor the engine, and they fit neatly in the original pods, so the modification is nearly invisible. An AM/FM stereo system sounds great thanks to plenty of sound insulation in the body and you'll note that the shifter now manages six gears instead of the usual four. Cold A/C is a nice side-benefit of using late-model running gear and the trunk is correctly finished with a reproduction mat and spare tire, adding to the blurry line between stock and modified.  ", "  The engine is an 350 cubic inch LT1 V8, and obviously it's a neat fit in the Camaro's engine bay. Transplanted from a C4 Corvette, it makes big power and loves to rev, and with fuel injection good road manners are a given. There's also a big aluminum radiator with electric fan, a serpentine belt drive system for the accessories, and OEM-style wiring to ensure it stays reliable. It's backed by a 6-speed manual transmission with two overdrive gears as well as a 10-bolt rear end with a Posi limited slip and just enough gear to make it entertaining without getting annoying on the highway. The front suspension is augmented with tubular A-arms and new shocks, while the stock leaf springs manage the rear. A recent dual exhaust system gives it that characteristic rumble while keeping the stock-style transverse muffler.

", "  It's safe to say that we like the way this Camaro looks. A lot! It's got the right stance, the right color, and the overall look of the second-generation cars is quite aggressive.  That's especially true thanks to upgrades like the big block Corvette-style hood and Z/28-style full-width spoiler.  But that's not what first grabbed you attention.

The Camaro was GM's answer to the popular Ford Mustang which garnered significant attention and sales to the general public. This pony car was different from the competition in design, performance and even its name which supposedly was chosen after Chevrolet's marketing team wrote down more than 2,000 words beginning with \"C\" in order to keep the tradition going with its cars starting with the letter.  While the true definition of the name was debated, Chevrolet countered with this, \"\u00c3\u00a2??A Camaro is a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs.\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d  In respect to this statement, the car you are viewing is truly that and then some.

Take a seat in the handsome light blue interior and wrap your hands around the steering wheel that provides an excellent view of the sporty instrument cluster.

The rebuilt 350ci and 4 speed are a great platform for you to start your custom build or leave it alone just like it sits.  It is hard to find a first generation Camaro these day that isn\u00c3\u00a2??t highly custom and price to boot.  Take advantage of this nice clean example and begin with one of the iconic muscle cars of all time. The styling of the 1968 Camaro was very similar to the 1967 design. With the introduction of Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system, the side vent windows were deleted. Side marker lights were added on the front and rear fenders which was a government requirement for all 1968 vehicles. It also had a more pointed front grille and divided rear taillights. The front running lights (on non-RS models) were also changed from circular to oval. The big block SS models received chrome hood inserts that imitated velocity stacks. The shock absorber mounting was staggered to resolve wheel hop issues and higher performance models received multi-leaf rear springs instead of single-leaf units. Options include: Performance tires, rally wheels, power brakes, seat belts, vinyl interior.

"description": ["Big block power wrapped around a distinctive color package... So while all 1969 Chevrolet Camaros are desirable, this one has the look, sound, and power to make it always memorable.  ", "  Freshly painted this shade of dark green, this coupe has a crisp and clean appearance with a hint of metallic element.  The shiny paint works with super straight bodywork, to offer a combination that truly stands out on arguably the most iconic body style for the Camaro.   This distinction is only heightened by the iconic dual stripe package that has been rendered in a cool metallic silver and clear coated in with the rest of the paintwork.  The result is a coupe that makes a stellar first impression.  Plus, all of your favorite first-gen Camaro elements are in place like the cowl induction hood and D80 rear spoiler.  Of course, it wouldn't be a true 60s machine without plenty of bright work.  It's everywhere, from the factory chrome bumpers, to the hood pins, to the upgraded 17-inch Boyd Coddington alloy wheels.  ", "  While the exterior is impressive, the interior might grab the most attention.  Most other cars from this era have been altered to black, but this one stands out because it retains its original distinctive green.  The interior feels like a precious emerald with the vinyl bucket seats, carpeting, door panels, and even the headliner all in this coordinating hue.  The driver gets some breakup from the green with the wood inserts on the dashboard and center console.  Then again, you probably weren't paying any attention to the color of the console because you were too busy noticing how it has the factory features everyone wants.  Yes, that's the horseshoe shifter and the iconic (and fully-functioning) quad gauge set for the oil, fuel, temperature, and battery.  You get a grippy Grant GT steering wheel, and beyond that is the dual pod for the large speedo and tach.  All of this tells you senses that there's something special under the hood even before you twist the key and hear it roar.  ", "  The 454 callouts on the fender are not lying.  This is a larger big block than Chevy ever installed on their own for the first-gen, but it looks right at home in the engine bay.  It has a nice presence with polished components like the Moroso valve covers, air topper, alternator, and pulleys.  But more than just looking nice, this big block was built to be a seriously mean machine.  Besides the monster displacement, it has go-fast goodies like an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock RPM air gap intake, and MSD ignition.  Plus, those long tube headers that add even more power as they contribute to the rumble of the dual exhaust. But all this serious power is nothing without control.  That's why you also have upgrades such as modern performance tires and four-wheel disc brakes.  Add in power steering and a stout three-speed automatic transmission, and you soon realize this is a beastly Camaro that's easy to tame.  ", "  Kermit the Frog says it's not easy being green...but that's only because he didn't have the perfect '69 Camaro like this one.  If you like to stand out in all the best ways, don't miss out on this one.
