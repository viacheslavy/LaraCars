Especially dressed in classic Guards Red, with a G50 transmission, whale tail and that Targa bar! What a jaw dropper!The 3.2 Carrera was introduced in 1984 while replacing the 911 SC, which had its run from 1978-1983.  The Carrera name was revived in this generation of 911, Carrera meaning \"race\" and \"career\" in Spanish suited this 911 well as it did win many achievements in its run of endurance championships and races.  Most can say that this shape of 911 lasted for over three decades, but the final years of 1987-1989 were the pinnacle years for that infamous 3.2 silhouette. What makes a G50 3.2 special is the transmission.  This transmission replaced the earlier 915 gearbox, allowing for easier throws due to more modern synchros, and a hydraulic throwout on the clutch pedal allowing for more responsive clutch feel.  Last but not least let's discuss how infamous the 911 Targa is.  The first 911 was produced in 1963 since that point Porsche wanted to create an open top experience without compromising the structural rigidity of the chassis. In 1967, the first Targa was built.  The nomenclature of the Targa was derived and used to commemorate Porsches victories in the Targa Florio road race. The wheelbase featured a full roll hoop replacing the b-pillars. The aforementioned interpretation of the Targa remained this way until the 993 chassis was introduced with a full glass roof utilizing the 993 convertible chassis.  This makes the 3.2 Targa even more special and collectible since it remained true to its roots and proudly displays that Targa bar!This 3.2 Targa oozes character, functionality, and style everywhere it goes.  We love the Targas here at RFMC, and look forward to sourcing this Targa to a new home!Please call Louie for more information.  516-784-9619."], "Exterior:": "Guards Red", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "85836"}},

This immaculately maintained coupe was only offered for one year, and so it still commands respect wherever it goes.  Which is good, because it's also a blast to drive.", "The 944 Turbo S continued Porsche's tradition of building serious driver's cars. The ''S'' model was a rare upgrade for the 1988 model year, and so that's why you're looking at such a cherished example.  The factory-correct Silver Metallic Rose was given a professional respray in 2014 to keep this distinct hue looking its best.  In fact, a great color always has extra merit on a 944 Turbo because of its updated styling w/integrated bumper. The practical side of this front fascia carries large fog lamps and extra cooling ducts.  Fit and finish are typically Porsche excellent and even the black rubber trim like the rear spoiler and weather stripping is smooth and supple. And because this is the top of the 944 line, Porsche also upgraded the Turbo S with a distinctive set of 16-inch Club Sport wheels.", "Not only do we like how distinct the exterior color is, but also the hint of red really looks great against the burgundy plaid interior.   The tartan pattern is part of a great performance tradition at Porsche, and so it offers extra distinction to the Turbo S.  And with so few miles on this coupe, it remains fantastically well-preserved today.  A limited edition also means a loaded vehicle.  You get air conditioning, power windows, power locks, power seats, sunroof, cruise control, and the correct Blaupunkt AM/FM/cassette stereo. There's even modern safety with anti-lock brakes and dual front airbags.  In fact, the only piece that we can find that's not from the factory is a well-integrated K90 radar detector system.  That's just another reminder that Porsche builds performance machines.  That's why the steering wheel has the perfect grip; the tach is large and prominent; and the gearstick just seems to be located in the perfect position for your right hand.", "What makes the S model so special is this is when Porsche fitted a larger turbocharger to the motor.  That means you could get 247 horsepower from just 2.5 liters. The lightweight nature makes these cars a little pocket-rocket.  Plus, it was engineered to be a terrific handling machine with the motor canted over at an angle for a lower center of gravity, and the rear-mounted five-speed transmission means that the car has almost ideal 50/50 weight distribution. Plus, the Turbo S fully independent suspension received upgrades from its 928 big brother.  Add in features like four-wheel disc brakes, power steering, and Porsche's legendary engineering prowess, and you realize this is blast to drive anytime.", "The sale comes with all the right paperwork, including the owner's manual packet, maintenance records folder, title documentation, and a reproduction window sticker. And because this one-owner car has always been babied (even the clutch and flywheel were replaced in 2015) is more proof that the car has led an easy life as a fair-weather toy.  So if you're a true connoisseur this pampered Porsche is ready right now.  Call today!!!"], "Exterior:": "Silver Metallic Rose", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "16949"}},
