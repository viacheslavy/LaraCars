The second thought in reference to the car in this ad is that color is always very important and XKE's in cream just have a certain amount of extra \"POP\"!   As you can see from the photos of this 1969 Jaguar XKE coupe that is listed it is strikingly beautiful. It is interesting to note that a previous owner who appears to have had much experience with the early XKE's with their 3.8 engines, decided that while he loved the lines of his 1969 Jaguar coupe, he much preferred the early 3.8 engines to the six cylinder engines that were factory installed in the 1969 Jaguars.  With that in mind he proceeded to replace the 4.2 engine with a 3.8 engine.  The current owner has had the engine super detailed.  It is our understanding from the private seller that the 3.8 engine has under 500 miles since 1988.  Actual mileage unknown.The current owner has driven this car on trips up to about 50 miles and has indicated that it drives just as it should. The manual transmission operates as it should.The cream paint is complimented by the red leather interior. The current owner would like to make note that the radio is currently not working and he believes that it is not the original radio. The 1969 Jaguar XKE coupe in this listing has been fully detailed with all engine and body parts cleaned.  Take a look at the photos to see how exceptionally well that the car does show. The current owner describes the appearance of this car as a beautiful driver but certainly not a trailer queen. Considering how the XKE's have been escalating in price, the reserve is very conservative and you can certainly feel free to bid to win and be happy that you did."], "Exterior:": "White", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "473"}},

Current owner is a lifelong Jag enthusiast and member of the Jaguar Owner's Club of Los Angeles (affiliated with Jaguar Club of North America).

Previous registered owner (whom I am informed was just the second registered owner) died in 1987 shortly after paying off the loan on the car. His widow was not able to care for the car, and when it failed a California emissions inspection in or around 1990, it was mothballed and passed from one family member to the next.

Thousands invested in mechanicals to bring this beauty back to life and now she runs like a champ. New wiring harnesses for main engine compartment and alternator completed in March 2018, with extensive other electrical work performed (condensers, relays, fuses, starter rebuilt) in 2016. All new OEM belts and hoses, new aluminum radiator by Cool Cats of NJ, new power brake servo, new master/slave clutch cylinders, entirely new exhaust system including shiny new black manifolds and stainless Bell exhaust pipes and mufflers which sound beautiful and gurgle with joy on the downshift. Mechanical speedometer and dash clock were rebuilt by a recognized expert in Smiths gauges; the clock now works beautifully with a quartz movement for improved accuracy and reliability. Original 4-speed manual gearbox (Gearbox No. 1KE1979) paired with the original 4.2L inline six-cylinder engine. Original Engine No. of 7R4828-9, but this engine is unstamped, possibly indicating that the original engine was swapped out by a dealership under warranty early in its life and the original engine number was not re-stamped onto the new engine block. No air conditioning for the perfect analog driving experience free of complications. Upgraded RetroSound stereo head unit with full Bluetooth connectivity and new speakers for period-correct appearance but modern soundtrack for your weekend canyon drives.  Original copper radiator and Sanyo stereo cassette head unit (non-operating) have been retained in case the new owner wishes to restore them. All records for the last two-year restoration have been maintained and go with the car to the lucky new owner.", "Aesthetics", ". Dark blue leather interior is like a time warp, having been covered", "and", "garaged in drought-ridden Southern California for 30+ years.  Silver paint appears to have received a respray sometime in the 1980s prior to being garaged. Paint has a few superficial nicks and scratches. Typical parking lot door dings on the passenger side. One hard-to-discern concave dent on the nose near the grill opening (likely where a small can of paint or a like heavy/blunt object fell on it while in storage), and less than a foot north of that, one convex dent where a mechanic may have closed the bonnet on his tools, leaving a mark in the steel. There appears to be no rust on the car except possibly some superficial surface rust in some crevices.  New Hankook whitewall tires on original chrome wire wheels show their age but are still usable and could benefit from re-chroming at some point. Original spare tire (appears to be unused, with chalk still on the tire) in the boot with tool roll (no jack or knock-off tools, sorry).  Bumpers show well, with some superficial pitting visible upon close inspection. Boot hatch window has received new rubber and chrome trim and is solid and leak-free. Driver's door window received new rubber as well.  Remaining rubber along windows and bumpers is intact but aging.", "In short, this is a period sports car with appropriate patina and targeted upgrades that runs like a champ. This car gets more attention wherever it goes than any car I've previously owned. It is a wonderful work of art.
