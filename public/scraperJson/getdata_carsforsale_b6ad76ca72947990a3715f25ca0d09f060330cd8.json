HISTORY  Ford introduced a dramatically new style of pickup in 1961 with the fourth generation F-Series. Longer and lower than its predecessors, these trucks had increased dimensions and new engine and gearbox choices. Additionally, the 1961-1963 models were constructed as a unibody design with the cab and bed integrated. This proved unpopular and Ford reverted to the traditional separate cab/bed design in 1964.

THIS IS THE BRONCO YOU WANT! Restored, power brakes, 302 V8, uncut, red, etc. A dream come true!   HISTORY  The original Bronco was an ORV (Off-Road Vehicle), intended to compete primarily with Jeep CJ models and the International Harvester Scout. The Bronco's small size riding on a 92-inch (2,337 mm) wheelbase made it maneuverable for some uses, but impractical as a tow vehicle. The Bronco was Ford's first compact SUV.  The idea behind the Bronco began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey, who also conceived the Ford Mustang; and similarly, Lee Iacocca pushed the idea through into production. In many ways, the Bronco was a more original concept than the Mustang; whereas the Mustang was based upon the Ford Falcon, the Bronco had a frame, suspension, and a body that were not shared with any other vehicle.

The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00c2\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964\u00c2\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

Production of the Thunderbird began later on in 1954 on September 9 with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model on October 22, 1954. Though sharing some design characteristics with other Fords of the time, such as single, circular headlamps and tail lamps and modest tailfins, the Thunderbird was sleeker and more athletic in shape, and had features like a hood scoop and a 150 mph  speedometer hinting a higher performance nature that other Fords didn't possess.This 1957 Thunderbird has Starmist Blue Paint with a matching two tone interior. It also has a navy blue soft top and a Starmist Blue Hard top with Stand. This car has aftermarket AC that blows cold. This beatuy is powered by 312 cubic inch motor with a 3 speed transmision.

Frey was the head engineer for the Mustang project - supervising the development of the Mustang in a record 18 months from September 1962 to March 1964 - while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. One of the design requirements established by Ford for this Mustang was that it should be a 4-passenger car and this has been neatly accomplished while still retaining much of the ''coupe'' look. The 1966 Mustang debuted with moderate trim changes including a new grille, side ornamentation, wheel covers and gas cap. Ford's new C-4 ''cruise-o-matic'' three-speed auto transmission also became available for the 225 hp V8. This '66 Mustang Hardtop has lots of appeal, from it long, low lines to its recognizable engine growl it's what made this ''America's Favorite Fun Car''. There is plenty of room for the driver to get into the Mustang, the door being well placed in this respect, the bucket seats are above average and the shift lever is within comfortable reach. We're offering this 1966 Ford Mustang Hardtop adorned in RED over BLACK VINYL. This classic comes with $472 (in 1966) dollars in Extra Charge options including the CRUISE-O-MATIC 3-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, 289CID-2V 200HP V-8 ENGINE, POWER STEERING, RADIO & ANTENNA, TINTED GLASS WINDSHIELD, 2-SPEED ELECTRIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS & DAY/NIGHT REARVIEW MIRROR.

Rather than continuing to grow, the Thunderbird, like much of the domestic product line, shrunk in size as a response to growing concerns about fuel costs. The car was nearly 1,000 pounds lighter than the 1976 model, and rode on a wheelbase that was 6 inches shorter. In addition to size, the 1977-79\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Thunderbird\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price was reduced as well, now with a $5,000 base price. The car was still Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entrant in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal luxury car\u00e2\u20ac\u009d market, however, despite the smaller package.The Thunderbird\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new look was similar in spirit to earlier models, only now it featured concealed headlights, a more square grille, and a glassier cabin, with opera windows.The car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 302-cid, 130-hp V-8 was standard and 149- and 161-hp versions of the 351-cid V-8 were optional. Regardless of engine choice, shifting was managed by a three-speed automatic transmission. This particular example is equipped with the optional 351 V8 and has optional Factory Air Conditioning. The car hails from Arizona where it has only been driven 30,803 since new. From the outside to the inside, every corner of this Thunderbrid is absolutely impeccable. The original owner took extremely good car of his Thunderbird and did not let her go until 2 years ago. We also have all the original paper work for the car including Protect-o-Plate, Warranty Car, Sales Receipt and Owners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Manual. Overall, the car is in superb condition and belongs in a museum. For more information or to make an offer, give Austin a call at 863-226-8590.
