Although its overall size and character was largely unchanged, the 1969 Cadillac was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like front fender treatment evolved and helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all-new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. Stretched body and trim; Fleetwood emblems and embellishments; doors cut into a formal, high-headroom roof, and generally higher appointment and trim levels continued to mark Cadillac's most luxurious line.

Appearance was smoother and more rounded, thanks in part to the division's first use of curved side glass, and the tailfins - a Cadillac tradition since 1948 - were gone. The big V-8 was repositioned six inches forward of its previous location in a new box-section perimeter frame, replacing the old X-type. A completely new four-link rear suspension system combined with front suspension refinements for an even smoother ride, and a revised exhaust setup brought an already quiet automobile even closer to silence. It had been a long time since Cadillac had made so many significant advances in a single model year. Naturally, the Fleetwood Eldorado convertible shared in these. Like the Sixty-Special, it was again bereft of bodyside trim apart from the wide rocker moldings, but the fender skirts were back once more as standard. Predictably, Eldorado sales, like those of the entire Cadillac line, increased markedly.", "This is a beautifully restored Eldorado convertible in its original color Hampton Blue in base/clear coat.

Reserved only for the top elite, these always command respect.  So to find one so complete and with a few nice modern upgrades makes this a true upper-echelon stunner.", "You instantly knew someone special was arriving when you saw one of these long-wheelbase Caddys pulling up.  These Series 75 sedans had a distinct look and tall roof line that instantly conveyed opulence.  In fact, the same money at the Chevy dealership in '62 could have bought a top-of-the-line trio with an Impala wagon, sport coupe, and convertible \u2013 all with V8s.  And there would have been enough left over to fill the gas tank a few times!  Because of this pricing level, these Fleetwoods were sold as limousines.  That means a sedan like this is the rarest Cadillac they sold with less than 700 examples made in 1962.  So just imagine how many have survived to be this complete over 55 years later!  The wide grille, form-fitting bumpers, rear fender skirts, and iconic tailfins \u2013 it all shows you this example has been treated with care.  The original black has been traded in a while ago.  But it's hard to tell it this long sedan was anything but Woodrose Pink all its life, because all the details were covered - from the full-length side trim to the slats in the factory wheel covers.  And let's face it, who doesn't love a premium pink Cadillac?", "The consignor states that $13k was invested in updating the interior, and we think it was money well spent.  The gray leather seats with exterior-matching inserts kick off a fully coordinated package with the door panels, carpeting, headliner, trunk, and dash.  The front gets plush power adjustable bucket seats with an armrest and cup holder center console.  There's even an AM/FM/CD/XM stereo with modern Bluetooth.  But even with all these upgrades, nothing really beats the view from Cadillac's classic skinny dual spoke steering wheel.  It gives you a terrific view of everything from the ultra-wide speedometer, to the power window switches at the base of the wraparound windshield.  But in a car like this, the rear is just as important as the front.  There is a limousine level of legroom, and it even has great vintage elements like the provisions for rear air conditioning.  But just like the front seats, there's also modern conveniences, too.  The custom storage cabinet, cup holders, and overhead DVD player mean this classic Caddy is still ready for a comfy road trip.", "Cadillac's 390 cubic-inch motor fills this engine bay properly with big power.  This V8 looks fantastically well presented with the blue block and valve covers hiding under the tidy black belts, hoses, and air grabber.  The consignor states that the motor was rebuilt less than 700 miles ago, and the way it fires up with ease backs that up nicely.  With an advertised 325 horsepower, it has the kind of legs to be strong around town and cruise at 70 MPH on the highway.  Plus, with a Hydramatic transmission, new power brake booster, new rear air shocks, new universal joints, and power steering this has the right features to continue the Series 75 Fleetwood's tradition of opulence.", "Complete with build receipts, this is an exceptionally rare classic that we know won't stay available for long.

I was told it was the longest, heaviest car General Motors ever manufactured. Sherman is white with black interior that has some silver thread in it. Sherman arrived at our house in approximately 1961. My family consisted of; my banker father,  my homemaker mother, my little sister and myself. Mom drove my sister and I to school, she made us sit in the backseat. One day on the way home, I saw smoke coming out under the passenger side of the front seat. My mom pulled over and got us out of the car. Later that night, after being told the motor under the seat overheated, she told dad that she wanted cars that had no electrical seats that might endanger us girls by catching on fire. Dad was about ready for a new car and told his brother, a car dealer, the new requirement. Since dad was a banker, he wanted a nice car to take clients to meals and etc. My uncle said he had just the car for him. A 1959 Cadillac that had no power windows or seats. Dad brought the car home and I don't remember which parent said \u201cit's as big as a Sherman tank\u201d. We all piled in for a ride. We went a couple of blocks and it stopped. We walked home, called Uncle Ed and mom said she never wanted another car from him. It turned out that when the gas gauge showed a quarter tank, it was empty, It also had a speedometer that didn't register the correct speed. Dad thought than would come in handy if he got stopped for speeding. He could then have it fixed. Dad loved the new car and mom liked Cadillacs so all was well. I remember the family driving up to the World's Fair in Seattle Washington in 1963. My sister and I split the back seat and it was packed with all my Barbies and my sisters Troll Dolls, each on there respective sides. I always sat on the passengers side and my sister behind the driver. To make the trip more affordable, they though we'd camp on some nights and stay in motels the other nights. We had never camped before so off to Sears we went for camping things. The latest in a tent, no center pole, was purchased with all the other stuff like a camping stove, lanterns, sleeping bags etc. Dad loved to BBQ so he got a small habachi for BBQing. On the way north, we stopped in Yosemite to stay for about a week. When we stayed in Tuoluomne Meadows, it was cool at night. He BBQ'd something for dinner and we turned in for the night. At some point, he woke up and it was cold in the tent. He brought in the smoldering habachi to warm up the tent. A couple hours later my mom woke up coughing. She woke everyone else. My sister wouldn't wake up so they carried her out to the fresh air. My dad had never camped and didn't know that he tried to kill us with carbon monoxide fumes. My sister did come to and we never camped again. We made it to the Fair and home without other incidents. Dad drove Sherm until the late sixties. I took my driving test in Sherm. The man at DMV told me that he wouldn't make me paraell park the car, if I could do a K turn I'd pass. I'd take Sherm cruising the Esplanade in Redondo Beach and up through Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. I could fit all my high school friends in it at one time.I started working in a bank and Sherm became my car. I did run out of gas on Hawthorne Blvd.after work one day, it was tricky to judge the gas gauge. You didn't push Sherman far. The traffic was backed up for miles. After that, I got gas whenever the gauge was at half full. I moved to Santa Barbara in 1971 and the place I rented had an old barn that I used as a garage. I did screw up one there time with the gas gauge. I was on my way to work, it was potluck day and we all dressed up for Halloween. You guessed it, I ran out of gas. I went to a house near by and rang the doorbell. The person wouldn't open the door but did offer to call my work. When the Assistant Manager came to get me, she couldn't stop laughing. I was dressed as a little girl, had my casserole dish in hand and waiting on a street corner. Good ole Sherm. That was the last time I ran out of gas! I was dating a guy that threw the Javelin for UCSB. We could go to track meets with his javelin in the car slanted with the tip out the window. When we got married, we got a newer sports car. What a difference! My dad took Sherm  home, as I said he loved that car. He kept it until I bought a house in 1980. He said now I had a garage and it was my turn to house Sherm. I used Sherm to drive a bride and groom after their ceremony, take friends cruising State street in Santa Barbara, and driving him when I wanted to feel like I was in high school again. Old time rock n roll playing on the radio. My husband makes me back  it in the garage. With a long drive, curving drive way, I'm tired of twisting around to do that. The steering wheel had an inside silver ring, which you used to honk the horn. My dad broke the top half when he hit it too hard and I broke the bottom half doing the same thing. You know press the bar that goes across instead of the silver ring. One year I bought a Christmas tree from the Boy Scout lot. When the guy helping me asked if I wanted it tied on top, I told him no. I told him it would fit in the trunk. He offered me the tree free if it did. It fit, but since it was a Boy Scout lot I didn't take him up on his offer. Since about 1995, Clark Motors in Santa Barbara has done all the servicing on it. It is fun to drive, I mean float down the road. People look and smile and give a thumbs up. You just feel good driving Sherman. It's time for someone else to enjoy Sherman and I hope he gets a good home.", "For additional information please phone Dave Henry at 805 705-4924.", "__________________________________________________________", "Spokemotors.com is not a dealer but a marketing and advertising firm.

The fuel and temperature gauges are inoperable.", "In overall terms, 1963 Cadillac was essentially the same as the previous year. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625 inches further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body-side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A DeVille signature script was incorporated above the lower beltline molding near the rear of the body. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with wool, leather, or nylon upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors, and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices.
