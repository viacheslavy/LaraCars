The car was bought new at Rocket Olds/MB in Abilene, TX on June 14th 1979. It was sold to its second owner 10 years later in 1989 with only 20k miles on it. The most recent owner had it here in Phoenix, and only put 26k miles on it during the next 28 years! It is rare to find these SL's with this kind of low mileage because once you drive this car you won't want to get out. Here is your chance to own the Mercedes flagship for a fraction of its original sticker cost.", "The list of some of the equipment:", "-4.5L V8 Engine -Automatic Transmission -Power Windows -Power Door Locks -Brand New Soft Top -Removable Hard Top -Original Becker Mexico Cassette -Ice Cold A/C -Beautiful Original Tobacco MB Tex Interior -Beautiful Original Bundt Alloy Wheels The body on the car is in very good condition and was extremely well maintained. The paint on the car is still its original coat of Maple Yellow and is in awesome condition and looks as good as the day in rolled of the lot. The car has been completely inspected underneath from front to back and is solid as a rock as a west coast car should be. The car is riding on gorgeous original 14'' Bundt alloy wheels with radial tires. All chrome trim, glass, and rubber seals are in great shape. The black soft top is brand new and also had the seals replaced with the top. The hard top has good seals and the headliner is in awesome shape. Overall the exterior appearance of this car is a 9 out of 10. The interior is in great shape all around. The dash and door panels are in perfect condition. The MB-Tex seats are all in very good condition and look absolutely as good as the day it was new which shows the quality of material used in this car. The wood grain is in excellent condition. The carpets are all very nice and have been professionally cleaned. All dials and controls function as they should; power windows and antenna also are fully functional. The sound system is also very nice with the original Becker Mexico Cassette still in place and sounding great! Mechanically, this SL runs GREAT! The car starts right up and shifts smooth as silk. The V8 engine is surprisingly quick and responsive. Many Mercedes experts and mechanics stand behind the 4.5L as the best engine Mercedes ever made. It is reliable, easy to fix, and parts are readily available. The suspension is very tight and feels solid even at autobahn speeds above 90mph. The car has all of its service stamps up to date and all mechanical systems are top notch. The climate control system functions great and the notorious climate control servo box under the hood has been updated. All in all, this is one of the cleanest and nicest SL's that I have had the privilege of being associated with. It has been professionally maintained and truly loved by its previous owners. These cars are only original once, and getting ultra-hard to find in this unmolested condition. This Mercedes is a fantastic car for the price and includes every option offered in this car. This is your chance to get an almost new 450sl convertible for a fraction of the original cost and super well maintained. The car has a clean Arizona Title. Any further questions please call Jon at 480-703-2337. The car is located in Sunny Scottsdale, AZ!"]}},
