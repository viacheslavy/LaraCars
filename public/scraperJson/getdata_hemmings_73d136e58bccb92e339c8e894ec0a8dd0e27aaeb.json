After all, we bet you'd expect to pay much more for a 1965 Ford Mustang with a wild paint job, custom interior, four-on-the-floor, and an upgraded V8 under that cool Cobra Jet hood.", "We could tell you this is a red-hot deal, but you already know that from the paint.  The custom flames make a bold first impression as they consume the front end and make their way down this first-year Mustang's iconic profile.  But don't let that be your only deciding factor on this coupe.  Take a look at the rest of the quality work.  For example, the gray paint that covers the rest of the car has a great metallic element and plenty of shine to make sure that the whole body looks great.  And you have great iconic details like the fog lights from the GT package, and GT wheels from the later pony cars.  And speaking of those muscle Mustangs, don't you just love how this one utilizes the Cobra Jet shaker hood?", "Inside, the custom performance feeling continues with a leather bucket seat interior borrowed from a later-model Mustang.  That means you get upgraded comfort, while still getting the iconic pony embroidered on the seatback.  Plus, the cup holder center console is a great place to rest your elbow when your right hand is on the Hurst stick shift.  And your left hand is going to love the grippy Gant GT sports steering wheel.   While this has an upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo, all these performance pieces are a clear sign your favorite soundtrack will really be the rumble of the dual exhaust.", "While the interior and exterior have a bold standout presence, the engine bay is all about getting down to business.  Within the black walls you can see the 289 cubic-inch motor's bold blue block radiating power.  Plus, with the fresh air topper feeding the Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, you know there's extra power coming from the V8.  You have complete control over this motor thanks to the four-speed top loader stick shift.  As you look over all the photos, you're going to spot all the right supporting components, like front disc brakes and an adjustable coilover rear suspension.  There's even a Champion aluminum radiator w/electric fan to keep this whole package running cool.", "So beneath the cool custom appearance lies the right pieces for a sturdy performance machine.  It's amazing all of this can be so affordable, but you're not the only one who thinks so.  That's why you need to hurry to grab this deal.

The car has a custom stance since it has a 1'' drop with new shocks and coils.  This is a great price for a very nice Mustang. We have many receipts from the restoration.

It was an interesting idea. Due to the harsh driving conditions that these cars were subjected to by rental drivers, many were taken out of commission and did not survive. Years later, originals that did endure are extremely valuable and easily net $150,000 or more at auction. Our 1965 Mustang coupe is a tribute to this Ford/Hertz concept. When it was restored 10 years ago, the exterior was refinished in Raven Black with GT350H gold accent stripes. Mustang GT steel wheels with radial tires and a classic GT hood scoop provide nice finishing touches to the exterior. The black vinyl interior was restored back to original. Some new elements include: seat upholstery/foam, carpeting, headliner, door panels/armrests, windshield glass and weather-stripping. The Mustang three-spoke wheel/horn components are also new and a Sony stereo furnishes your sounds. A Ford 302ci small block that is upgraded with an aluminum intake, Holley carburation, MSD ignition and tube headers w/2-1/2'' pipes powers our Mustang. It is backed by a 3-speed automatic transmission. The factory differential has new ring and pinion gears and new bearings. Brakes are standard 4-wheel drum units with new shoes and cylinders. This is a very nice Mustang GT350H tribute car that will sell quickly. ALL VEHICLES SOLD ''AS IS''."], "Exterior:": "Black", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "29650"}},
