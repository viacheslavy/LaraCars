The engine was de-bored to (66.8x71 mm) 2.0 L (1991 cc) V8 resulting in the smallest production V8 in history for a road car.Power output is 170 PS (125 kW) at 7700 rpm for a top speed of 137 mph (220 km/h). Smaller Weber 34 DCNF carburetors a lower final drive ratio and skinnier tires completed the technical changes for the 208. Chrome (rather than black) accents outside and the lack of fog lights were external visual indicators of the smaller-engined GT4. Inside the 208 GT4 featured a black rather than silver dash facing.

This 400i was delivered new to its first owner on April 9, 1985 and sold by Walnut Creek Ferrari INC in California. The car remained in the Bay area until moving to Palm Springs with the second owner in 2007 where it has been ever since. The original Grigio Metallic paint still shows very nicely with a very nice shine and luster. There are a few stone chips in the front nose and a couple small hairline cracks that has started in the edged by the headlights and hood lines. There is one area on the passenger fender that looks as if something has stained the paint (pictured). All of the exterior glass appears to be original even the front windshield with its original 400i specs. The interior of the car is all original and in lovely patina'd condition. The driver seat does show creasing but absolutely no tears or damage. The leather is still very soft and supple with no dye work. All of the carpets and dash are all original and show very well with no damage or excessive wear (The automatic gearbox selector guide trim piece has been replaced since the pics). This 400i starts right up and idles with ease and does not smoke under start up or acceleration. The car pulls smoothly and strong through all of the RPM range and shifts smoothly through all of the gears. The suspension feels very smooth and solid and sits at correct ride height (not sagged out like a lot of 400 series cars). The front end is nice and tight and does not pull or wonder. The car has newer correct factory Michelin TRX tires and rides beautifully. All of the electronics are operating as designed including the pop up headlights, exterior lights, interior lights, power antenna, factory radio, all dash lights and gauges. The power mirrors, windows, locks, AC is cold and the boot and front bonnet release buttons are also functioning. There is absolutely no rust on the car and the undercarriage is all original and untouched. This is a very original and unmolested 400i that is rarely seen in this well maintained original state. Accompanied with the sale of this car are the original Ferrari books in their original Ferrari pouch, the original Ferrari keys, the original jack and spare and a very large file of service records dating back to when the car was new. Thousands of dollars in recent work has been done by a specialist and servicing and repair work has been very consistent. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a very rare well maintained 400i with an excellent consistent service file and excellent provenance."], "Exterior:": "Grigio Metallic", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "36968"}},

I had the car looked over by a seasoned Ferrari mechanic and he was impressed with how well it has been preserved (especially since so many Mondial 8's have rotten away or have been used for parts). The car had a belt service and fluids changed in April of this year. It runs and drives great. The paint is a respray and has some small imperfections at close inspection, as well as some very small dents/dings that paintless dent removal could handle. There are a couple non-stock details like window tint and black painted wheel centers that could be \"undone\" if it doesn't suit the next owner. The engine bay looks immaculate, and the underbody looks clean. The interior is very clean, and it looks like the black leather was redyed during the restoration.
