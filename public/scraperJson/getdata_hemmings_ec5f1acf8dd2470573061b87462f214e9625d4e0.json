After all, it was the style that looked like it had the most gallop in all of the pony car crowd.  In fact, this one was given some great GT-style upgrades like the fog lights in front and the trumpeted dual exhaust coming out of the rear valance.  Mustang people love to point at correct styled steel wheels.  But the most impressive part of the car is the paint.  A red Mustang can always attract attention, but this one does it even better.  The paint was applied within the last year, and the investment in the cherry hue gives this the kind of gloss and shine that you couldn't even get if you picked this up from the Dearborn factory on day one.  Add in exceptionally straight bodywork and mirror-like chrome, and it's exactly what you want from this icon.", "This special feeling continues inside.  A pristine black interior is always desirable in a classic, and this one really goes the extra mile.  The seat look crisp; the door panels feel confident as you pull them closed; and the center console is equal parts elegant and sporty.  The feeling is everything you want from classic motoring as you sit behind an upgraded Lecarra wood and chrome steering wheel, rest you hand on the chrome shifter, and look out at the full round gauge panel.  And this one has all the right extra touches, too.  Everything from classic pieces like the Cobra tach that's on display in the center console, to the modern AM/FM/CD stereo with aux input so you can listen to the most modern tunes in your very vintage ride.", "If you were paying attention to the fender badges, you would know the engine bay keeps with this car's theme of tasteful upgrades.  This one is powered by a 302 cubic-inch V8 motor, which is larger than anything you could get in a Mustang for 1966.  It's presented quite nicely with the Ford racing valve covers as well as all the bright elements like the air topper, bracer bar, and Monte Carlo bar.  Beyond the style is some nice performance substance with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, and Mallory ignition.  Plus, this has some great investments for those who like to drive their classics.  This includes newer bushings, sway bars front & rear, and the hypnotic rumble of the newer dual exhaust.", "Complete with maintenance records, this always in-demand fastback has all the right features to be more aggressive without losing that original pony car spirit.

It's certainly highly coveted simply by virtue of its status as a first-generation Mustang, one of the most influential models ever introduced to the car buying public - a model that enjoyed such spectacular sales success that it earned a classification all its own. The Pony Car. But even among its celebrated brethren, it would stand out, as it not only carries a tasteful, yet eye catching exterior, but is also well-equipped to provide a great driving experience.", "While it's not all that uncommon to see a classic Mustang decked out in red paint, when you see one like this, where that coloring lands on just the right variation, you can't help but take notice. It's a bright shade, but doesn't veer into orange territory, and has a great ''wet look'' shine to it. The straight and unblemished front and rear bumpers, level and unmarred chrome trim and clear windshield and door glass all combine to give this classic Mustang a very vital look - a look that provides abundant evidence as to why this car caused such a stir when it was introduced and continues to draw the enthusiasm of collectors today. Through the ages, pretty much every photo of convertible vintage Mustangs shows them in open air configuration, but rest assured (should the weather warrant), you can rely on the power black convertible top as it's in fine shape, raises into place smoothly and even features an impressively clear plastic window in back.", "A very fresh looking black interior replaces the parchment original. It includes a pair of custom TMI bucket seats up front that very effectively recap the factory stitching and look, but feature a more bolstered, aftermarket shape, and a rear bench seat that shows very little wear. Just underneath, you'll find an expanse of clean, black carpeting. The stock steering wheel sits on a tilt column for additional driving comfort, while just beyond it, the dash area looks particularly good, with an instrument cluster filled with easily readable gauges that are rimmed in chrome, and a straight dashpad sitting over the top. A full-size spare with a lot of tread showing sits in the very tidy trunk area in back, whose floor is lined in Ford plaid.", "This is a classic car that's every bit at home on the road as it would be on display. A 302-cubic inch V8 sits underneath the hood in place of the factory issued 6-cylinder engine, offering far greater performance than its predecessor. It's carrying an Edelbrock intake and 4-barrel carb to up its game even further and offers impressive acceleration and a great sound as it exhales out ceramic coated headers into its Magnaflow exhaust. Ford's power steering was considered by many at the time to be superior to its counterparts as far as road feel was concerned, and that feature combines with slotted front disc brakes to make for a truly road-ready car that will certainly turn heads on the asphalt.  This highly coveted Ford classic sits on a set of 15'' steel rims, outfitted with BF Goodrich TA radials.", "Looking for an iconic vintage droptop that merges great curb appeal with the road manners you're looking for in a frequent driver?

This car originally came in white with black interior but was painted Burgundy with matching burgundy interior when it was restored in 2000.   The most recent owner had the car for 18 years here in Georgia and was purchased from an owner in Florida before that.  The odometer shows 74,164 which we believe to be original but we don't have the paperwork to confirm the actual mileage. The remanufactured engine was installed in 2011 and has barely been driven with only about 100 miles on the engine since the engine was installed.  The interior looks great with no tears or rips.  The doors are in excellent condition as well as the headliner and dash.  The back seat folds down and looks excellent.  All gauges are in operable condition.  A current radio was installed and additional oil pressure, temp gauges were wired in and are laying on the floor in front of the shifter.  They were not attached to the dash to preserve the original dash. This car comes with a spare tire and jack.   This is a driver.   We can organize the shipping to your location.

It's hard to find a more desirable first-gen pony car than a factory built K-code HiPo 289 with four-on-the-floor.  And now with a high-quality restoration, here's a rare opportunity at your dream turn-key classic Mustang.", "The name Vintage Burgundy for this car's factory-correct code X paint is a bit of cool foreshadowing.  When this one was built, they must have known how much of an extraordinary classic it would become. You have also picked up on all the correct GT exterior enhancements, including the fog light grille, GT side badging, rocker stripe, GT gas cap, and trumpeted dual exhaust mounted in the rear valance.  And someone spent the time and money to get this one right.  The paint has a high-gloss shine, and the light rolls evenly across it as it passes over the super-straight sheetmetal.  And on a car this good, only the best brightwork will do.  You see it everywhere from the mirror-like bumpers to the styled steel wheels.  But even if you strip away the rare packaging and solid investments, you'd fall in love with this pony car anyway.  After all, this is the exact car you picture when you close your eyes and dream about vintage motoring.", "If you think this looks sophisticated with the maroon paint against the parchment roof, then you're going to love it even more when you take the power folding top down.  Not only do you get more of the great parchment color, but also this is accented by burgundy.  And while this is the factory-correct colors right from Ford, it's such a well-coordinated and fresh presentation that people will ask you if it's custom work.  Plus, it includes the ultra-desirable ''pony'' package on the seatbacks. This one is so authentic that even the AM radio still works! We also bet you just love the way the wood paneling on the center console matches the steering wheel, glove box, and gauge panel.  And speaking of the gauges, you get the five-round readout cluster with large speedometer that makes the 1966 cars so desirable.  And yes, this one has the sought-after Rally-Pac.  This tach/clock combo is not only a great performance option, but it's also quite handy on a stick shift car like this.", "As much as you'll love the interior and exterior, it's the rare K-code HiPo 289 cubic-inch V8 under the hood that will impress even the ficklest Mustang enthusiast.  It's the motor that took home the trophies around the globe, and so to have a date-correct block with correct heads in this K-code car means this one will always be in-demand.  The V8 shows all signs of great care, and even has a hint of flash.  But more importantly, it's a very stock and tidy appearance that impresses true enthusiasts.  With the turn of the key, the dual exhaust gives a high power V8 symphony, and the four-speed manual transmission makes you the conductor.  That's the key to this car.  It might be a valued classic, but it's also an irresistible cruiser.  That's why you also have great driving features like more modern tires and front disc brakes.", "Complete with a reproduction owner's manual packet, K-code '66 Mustangs were quite rare.  And so to find one so complete in such a desirable droptop form, you soon realize rare opportunities like this are fleeting.

Plus, in-between them is an upgraded center console with an armrest and cup holders.  Even the steering wheel has been upgraded to a cool wood and chrome unit with a pony etched in the center.

However, the 260 engine was notoriously problematic so they were often replaced.

They also added a new radiator. The engine compartment is tidy with a Cobra intake and chrome cross brace.  The motor runs strong and true. Mated with a 4-speed manual gearbox and the tribute GT350 black with white stripes paint scheme, this car is a real head turner. Not only fun to look at but even more so to drive. It also features a hidden Bluetooth stereo. Be sure to check our website for all photos and video of it running. Call or e-mail if interested.
