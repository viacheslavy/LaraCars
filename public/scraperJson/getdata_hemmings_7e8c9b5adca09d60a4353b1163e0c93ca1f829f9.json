That run ended some 35 years ago and you don't see CJ5s on the road all that often nowadays, making this 1977 Jeep CJ5, with its rugged, timeless looks and sure-footed nature, all that more of a great find.", "It may have been designed with practical utility as a priority, but this CJ5 also greets the present day looking great. Its red paint is in consistently nice condition, covering the Jeep's relatively compact form with a great shine that prompts you to take a second look to distinguish this classic all-terrain vehicle from its more modern counterparts, as its fresh appearance is completely at odds with its more than 40 years of service. The clues to its more vintage military lineage are there - in the more narrowly set headlights and relatively modest wheelbase that adds to its obstacle-surmounting prowess. Of course, the sturdy winch mounted on its front bumper provides an unmistakable clue that this 4-wheel mountain goat was designed for rigorous service in often unforgiving conditions. The beneficiary of a thorough restoration, it cuts an impressive figure with new black doors and stone guards decorating its sides, fresh looking bumpers in front and back, and a new-looking hard top resting securely in place above.", "A very freshinterior sits inside those new doors. The two-tone front bucket seats are nearly new, sporting a decidedly modern look and, as is the case with the bench seat in back, are well-padded and comfortable. They straddle a center console that's also been refurbished and features some lockable storage space for valuables. The seating is just above a floor and interior wheel wells that feature a spray-on liner for durability that has done its job well, as there are no glaring imperfections to be found inside. Up front, the dash area has been rebuilt from scratch, featuring smooth red steel and a chrome-framed instrument cluster that harbors an assortment of gauges with an original look and very clear lenses. While the CJ5 certainly has a ''no-nonsense'' heritage, there are some welcome comfort features included, in the form of air conditioning that will certainly come in handy whether you find yourself on the asphalt or off, as well as an AM/FM/CD player to provide the tunes for your adventures.", "A 4.2 liter inline 6 cylinder sits under the hood to power this Jeep over any terrain you might wish to conquer. The engine is in good form, starting up promptly and running strong. Should you decide to take temporary leave of the road, with a flick of the lever just in front of the distinctive Hurst shifter, you can engage 4-wheel drive and, with this CJ5's generous wheel clearance and travel, its ability to handle obstacles is substantial. There are accommodations for more civilized conditions, as well, as power steering and front disc brakes help provide the road manners you'd want in a frequent driver. This timeless 4-wheel drive classic sits on a set of 15'' M/T wheels, outfitted with sizable 33x12.5x15 Goodyear Wrangler MT/R tires.", "Refurbished to an impressive level both inside and out, but retaining heaps of nostalgic appeal, this Jeep CJ5 would be a great acquisition for collector and off-road enthusiast alike.

Both the floors and bed have been spray-lined to protect them from the elements and maintain the rugged good looks of this unique off-road machine. You'll feel right at home as you're covering ground in this heavy duty machine. So strap yourself in and get ready to feel the power!", "A quick survey of the engine bay and undercarriage reveal that a significant investment has been made in the running gear to ensure dependability. The original straight six has been swapped out in favor of a Chevrolet 350 Vortec motor. Make no mistake about it, the Chevy small block that powers this machine is more than up to the task. Fired by an MSD distributor and high performance wires, it has been outfitted with an aluminum intake and Rochester carburetor. Here you have the perfect balance of brute horsepower, relentless torque and long term reliability. You'd be hard pressed to find a more worthy motor combination for this application.  Another compelling component of the drive train is the Borg-Warner T-18 four speed transmission. Revered by off-roaders as one of the best transmissions ever produced, the tough-as-nails T-18 is a steadfast favorite among enthusiasts when choosing a gear box for climbing the steepest inclines and negotiating the most treacherous landscape. It's the transmission they all want! Of course, the transfer case, differentials, and all of the other 4x4 and suspension parts have been well-maintained and are in good working order. The ever-popular manual locking hubs are employed on the front.", "This Jeep CJ-8 Scrambler has a lot going for it. It is equally at home on the highway or in the wilderness. This a truly fun ride that can easily double as both regular transportation and an over-the-top recreational machine. Not many vehicles can pull that off as easily as this one.

Take a good, close look at this 1984 Jeep CJ8 Postal Scrambler, which isn't your run-of-the-mill off-roader. Originally used for mail delivery in Alaska, it's got a unique look and a funky panel van vibe that will make it stand out at any Jamboree or cruise night you attend. And it's still a blast to drive!", "The Scrambler was a slightly longer CJ7, ostensibly a mini Jeep pickup. And by adding a custom panel van top and unique steel doors with straight window frames, it has an industrial look that is insanely appealing. Along the way, it lost its utilitarian paint job and gained a glossy coat of black that makes it look far more contemporary than it must have delivering the mail. Silver Scrambler decals and sport stripes dress it up properly and chrome pieces like the bumpers, grille, and mirrors add some much-welcome flash. But it remains a Jeep at heart, so things like the big fenders with rubber flares, round headlights, and a set of step plates mean that it's ready for just about anything. That fascinating panel van top fits beautifully and includes a large rear door, making this a lot like a vintage Land Cruiser and if you squint just right, maybe even a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen. Whatever the inspiration, I promise you'll have the only one at any event you go to and someone spent a ton of money to bring it up to its current fantastic condition. Not perfect, but pretty darned nice for a Jeep made to go anywhere.", "The interior remains basic, but in Jeep world, that's a virtue. High-back bucket seats have original-looking two-tone gray covers and yes, you're seeing it correctly, it's right-hand-drive (because it was used for delivering mail, of course). In application, it's easy to get accustomed to driving on the other side and after 10 minutes, you'll forget all about it. That is, until you show up somewhere and EVERYONE wants to know just what this Jeep's story really is. If you don't like attention, this isn't the right Jeep for you. But if you like to drive, this one has goodies like an automatic transmission, a full set of gauges, and carpets on the floor that make it feel reasonably civilized. The entire floor is protected with a spray-in bedliner, and even the large cargo hold has a nicely fitted carpet that makes it feel a little less bare.", "Jeep's bulletproof 258 cubic inch inline-6 provides plenty of power to have fun in the dirt and it's reasonably thrifty out on the road. With a fresh carburetor and lots of recent service work, it's ready to play and the durability is legendary. You'll note that there are additional changes under the hood to accommodate the right-hand-drive setup, but nothing too radical and almost everything is still available from the usual sources, so don't worry that this one is made of unobtainium. The 3-speed automatic transmission makes sense for mail delivery and it's linked to the same rugged transfer case and axles that all CJs carry, so it's ready for an adventure. There's a slight lift on the chassis to clear those giant tires, as well as a set of recent shocks and a newer exhaust system, so someone invested time and money here. 15-inch Blade blacked-out wheels look suitably industrial and carry huge 33x12.50-15 BFGoodrich All-Terrain tires.", "Everyone you know will do a double-take when they see this cool Jeep, and compared to most Scramblers of this quality, it's a bit of a bargain, and highly-collectable. And at its core, it's still a Jeep, so you know exactly what you're going to get. Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Black", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "184"}},
