Wearing brilliant Guards Red paint and a classic black leather interior, it has a very modern look with plenty of performance to match.", "Guards Red is the quintessential 911 color, and given Porsche's legendary quality control, it shouldn't be a surprise that it still looks fantastic more than 30 years later. It's always in fashion, but on a Porsche, it's something else entirely. Despite the reasonable price, this car still looks expensive and remains on many enthusiasts'' must-have list. Of course, like any high-end sports car, the shine is critical, so the fact that this 911 is ultra-straight and still fits together with typical German precision makes things that much more dramatic. It's showing a few signs of age, of course, because there's no way to hide from time, but things like the chin spoiler, color-matched mirrors, and flat, smooth flanks all look great and haven't been abused by the daily grind. There's no ''whale tail'' spoiler out back, so it has sleek, classic 911 look. All the black trim is likewise in good order, showing no UV damage and little fading. This sucker still looks like a million bucks.", "The black leather interior looks far more contemporary than the car's age would suggest. The high-back buckets are supportive but not constricting, perfect for high-speed blasts along your twisting mountain road or a long distance trip to the coast. The seat covers are a bit tattered, with some splits and scuffs, but fortunately replacements are relatively inexpensive and would really pay big dividends in terms of resale value. The instruments, with the big tach front and center in traditional Porsche fashion, are in excellent shape and there's a fat steering wheel with the traditional Porsche floating horn button. A Pioneer AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit dates the car a little bit, but again, upgrades are cheap and easy. But the important thing is that this car delivers a traditional Porsche feel with floor-hinged pedals, a 5-speed shifter that takes a firm hand to master, and a rear seat area that's more for storage than passengers. Up front, the boot is finished in gray fabric and there's a factory sunroof to help open things up inside.", "The SC came with a robust 3.0-liter air-cooled flat six engine, which, thanks to several durability enhancements, was one of the better Porsche products of the 1980s. It's insanely torquey and with smart gear ratios in the transmission, it screams out of the hole with a tenor wail that any car guy can recognize a mile away. Unlike most of its siblings, it's quite stock, which is important for both longevity and drivability, and there are signs of proper maintenance throughout the engine bay. The A/C has been converted to R134a refrigerant (it needs to be serviced), but otherwise the engine bay is as Porsche engineers intended and you'll never hesitate to turn the key and head out on the road. Traditional Fuchs alloys with black centers and polished rims give it a familiar Porsche look and carry staggered 205/55/16 front and 225/50/16 rear BFGoodrich radials.", "Any 911 is going to be an awesome car, but if you're looking for one with movie star looks, a bargain price, and has the performance to make you smile, look no farther than this SC.

Several early notations of services performed are recorded on the vehicle's Kardex, with Porsche Car Pacific, Burlingame is recorded as the handler. It's believed the 911 spent the majority of its life in California and Washington State. In recent years, the Porsche received a ''driver's'' restoration, the goal was not to produce a concours candidate, but rather a solid and reliable example to drive and casually display at the local cars and coffee and club events. The resulting car is just that. A great looking ''wood dash'' 911 capable of many more years of driving enjoyment. In August 2017, a thorough mechanical service was commissioned for 302811, inspecting and freshening all systems, including the brakes, suspension, exhaust and intake. The 911 retains its original numbers-matching engine and 5-speed transmission, both in excellent working order with solid compression from the fully-rebuilt 2.0 liter powerplant.", "Verified by its Porsche Factory Kardex and Certificate of Authenticity, the car is also complete with an original Driver's Manual, jack and tool kit. A recent surge of appreciation for 1964/5/6 ''Wood Dash'' 911s has been well deserved, and this late 1965 humbly displays the model in its purest form. Porsche's one-millionth 911 even celebrates early design with tributing finishes on its special edition car. 302811 is now available for Worldwide purchase and delivery from our Houston, Texas showroom, to learn more about this vehicle, please contact our sales department at (281) 497-1000 or", "[Email Dealer]", ". *please note this car is titled as a 1966", "$162,500.00", "Offers Welcomed", "SELLING YOUR CAR?", "Our Philosophy is Selling Made Simple!
