HISTORY  Starting in 1969, to aid sales and continue the winning formula of the Mustang, a variety of new performance and decorative options became available, including functional (and non-functional) air scoops, cable and pin hood tie downs, and both wing and chin spoilers. Additionally, a variety of performance packages were introduced that included the Mach 1, the Boss 302, and Boss 429. The two Boss models were to homologate the engines for racing. The 1969 Mustang was the last year for the GT option (although it did return on the 3rd Generation Mustang for the 1982 Model Year). A fourth model available only as a hardtop, the Grande, saw success starting in 1969 with its soft ride, \"luxurious\" trim, 55 pounds (24.9 kg) of extra sound deadening, and simulated wood trim.

This 1970 Mach 1 is a bargain compared to its big block siblings, so if you're looking for a genuine Mach 1 you can drive anywhere, here it is! With a brawny 351 under the hood, a high-visibility performance look, and an easy-to-drive demeanor, it's the Mustang for guys who love to hit the road.  ", "  Few will argue that the 1970 Mustang isn't one of the best-looking designs of the muscle car era, particularly in fastback form. But before we talk about performance and engines and all that, take a look at the special Mach 1 gear this one wears, including the low-profile hood scoop, chin spoiler, rear wing, and Mach 1 rocker panel callouts. None of those parts make the car go any faster, but they sure look like they do! The bright red paint is a little brighter than the original Medium Red, but thanks to a bare-metal repaint a few years ago, it's in excellent condition. It shows only very light signs of use, but nobody's going to complain when they hear the rumble of the V8 or the black strip running down the center of the hood. We're not sure what color it was originally, but if you're going to drive a Hi-Po Mustang, you may as well show off a bit, right?   ", "  Few interiors look better than the basic black this Mach 1 sports today. High-back buckets wear Ford's patented comfort-weave upholstery which is just that: a woven vinyl that's surprisingly comfortable and helps keep you cool. Matching door panels and black carpets keep it uniformly dressed, although they might be starting to show their age. Ford's twin-cockpit design puts a quartet of gauges ahead of the driver and it sports desirable options like power steering and brakes, a woodgrained steering wheel, and a center console. Gauges are original and operational, although the gauge faces are a little cloudy and while the original AM radio is still in the dash, it's not working and is due for an upgrade. It shows well overall, further proof that the comfort-weave upholstery wears like iron and that someone took exceptionally good care of this car. The trunk is finished with what appears to be the original mat and with the fold-down rear seat, there's a surprising amount of room in this fastback.  ", "  The engine is a correct H-code 351 cubic inch V8, the standard engine on the Mach 1. It's been recently rebuilt and upgraded with a Holley aluminum intake and 4-barrel carburetor under the stock air cleaner, but for the most part it looks pretty stock. The big Ford Blue air cleaner dominates the engine bay, but there are plenty of signs of proper maintenance, including fresh belts and hoses. It starts easily and makes great torque, a muscle car trademark and the rebuilt FMX 3-speed automatic transmission makes for relaxed cruising under any conditions. In back there's a 9-inch rear full of 3.00 gears which make high-speed blasts completely effortless. The undercarriage shows off a recent Flowmaster exhaust system, rebuilt power front disc brakes, fr"], "title": "1970 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "221", "price": "39995", "kilometers": 30850.966, "total_pages": 11, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29049879", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "29049879", "year": "1970", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 V8", "Mileage": "19,174 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

And for many of us, there's one in the past that got away, and now with prices on these cars skyrocketing, we thought we'd never get to own one of these awesome cars. Well, this 1969 Boss 302 tribute offers a more affordable way to own a legend, one with a few smart upgrades that you'd never find in an original Boss, and a high-dollar rotisserie restoration to boot, making this car the best of both worlds.  ", "  Now, we're not going to tell you that this is a real car, because you've already figured that out by the price. It's a very fresh restoration that's built for showing and driving, and if you've experienced a Boss 302 already, then you know that driving is what they do best. Grabber Orange isn't this car's original color, but it's the right color on a Boss, so that's what went on when the car was refinished. In fact, the paint is only six months old and has about 14 miles on it, so it's incredibly fresh and bright and done to a very high standard, completed by one of the most respectable shops in Atlanta. The Boss graphics are expertly applied and the body doesn't show any critical issues that would suggest a checkered past and the blacked out hood and deck lid are painted satin black for effect. Factory rear window louvers, a factory rear spoiler, and the blacked-out tail panel all work well with the bright orange paint and gorgeous chrome bumpers to give this Boss just the right look.  ", "  The black interior is especially nice, with new seat covers on the original buckets, correct door panels, and the critical Hurst shifter. The seats look upscale in the Mustang's all-black interior, and you can see why this was such a great place to do the serious business of driving fast. Factory gauges are original, but they work just fine and there are new bulbs inside, so they light up brightly at night. The original AM radio is gone, replaced by an AM/FM/iPod stereo that fits like it was born there. The shifter is a proper Hurst unit, complete with cue ball knob, but you'll note that it now manages five gears, not four, making this Boss a weapon on the street yet comfortable on the highway. The back seat looks almost new, and the neatly finished trunk offers a correct plaid mat that fits rather well.  ", "  The 302 cubic inch V8 that is the heart of the Boss looks awesome in the engine bay and even though it's not the real thing, it sure looks convincing.  It's correctly dressed in Ford Blue with a big air cleaner and proper reproduction decals, all of which make the 1969s unique. Upgrades include an Edelbrock intake manifold and Holley 4-barrel carburetor, and there's a Comp Cams bumpstick inside that gives it that famous cackling boss idle. It starts easily and runs great, pulling the car around with genuine authority. The 5-speed transmission doesn't mind the e"], "title": "1969 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "221", "price": "45995", "kilometers": 22.526, "total_pages": 11, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241841", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241841", "year": "1969", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "302 V8", "Mileage": "14 miles", "Exterior Color": "Grabber Orange", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

And smart hobbyists who like actually driving their vintage hardware are beginning to buy slick, fully-sorted weekend cruisers like this 1969 Mustang Mach 1. After all, these classics were built to be seen and enjoyed on the open road, not garaged and dusted with an air compressor. And with a fire-breathing stoker motor that's centered in a fully restored body and a virtual foundation of modern technology, this pro-touring pony will have you smiling and waving all day long! Looking for an awesome road warrior that's as livable as it is lust worthy? With this awesome Mach 1, you won't even give the word original a second thought!    BODYWORK/TRIM     Steal one glance at this Mach 1's super slick fuselage and you'll see what top notch craftsmanship truly looks like! A product of a high quality restoration, and a complete pro-touring build that was performed by a dedicated group of Mustang enthusiasts, its solid body was stripped to bare metal, thoroughly reworked and transformed from a tired old mare into a thoroughbred cruiser. Once that intense labor and tedious detailing resulted in good panel alignment, custom red base was accented with glossy war paint, sealed in a durable clear and buffed to a fantastic shine. The result is one mean looking pony car that looks good, runs great and has the macho bark to match its razor-sharp bite!      Ford designers made sure every year of the first generation Mustang had plenty of visual appeal. But, in our opinion, it doesn't get much better than 1969's masterful combination of aggressive accents and well-placed trim. At the front of this red hot coupe, a stainless trimmed grille hangs a prominent galloping horse emblem between traditional headlights, a thin bumper and a fierce chin spoiler. Behind that grille a stainless-pinned hood, which is complete with a functional Boss 429 scoop, visually balances glossy rear window louvers while well-maintained trim combines with bright chrome drip rails, familiar stainless wipers and body-matched racing mirrors to frame like-new glass. Below that hood, correct chrome door handles combine with fresh marker lamps, traditional stainless rocker spears and deep-set quarter scoops to add detail to the car's sinister mug shot.
