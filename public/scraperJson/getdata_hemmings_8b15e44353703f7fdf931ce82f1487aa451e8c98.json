Its gorgeous design, technological innovation, and racing achievement is unprecedented. First introduced in March of 1961 at the Geneva Auto Salon, the E-Type captured the hearts and minds of the entire automotive community. As oft quoted, Enzo Ferrari would even say it was \u201cthe most beautiful car ever made.\u201d After nearly 60 years, Jaguar\u2019s E-Type remains one of the most dramatic automobiles in the world.", "The E-Type\u2019s 14-year production run evolved over three major iterations. The extremely desirable first series lasted from 1961\u20131967. The second series E-Types were produced between 1967\u20131971, while the V-12\u2013powered third series cars were produced from 1971 until 1975. While 1961\u20131967 E-Types retain the Series 1 designation, a number of improvements were made for the later cars. First and foremost, engine size was enlarged to 4.2 liters, increasing the engine\u2019s output to a then powerful 265 hp and 273 foot-pounds of torque. The larger engine also featured a fully synchronized four-speed manual transmission, resulting in one of the finest driving sports cars ever produced.", "This beautiful Series 1 4.2-Litre Roadster is an exceptional example of the model. It was originally finished in Carmen Red over a black interior with a black convertible top. Its accompanying Jaguar Heritage Trust Certificate also records the E-Type as being dispatched on 11 November 1966 and then delivered through Jaguar Cars in New York. The original owner is noted as Roland M. Scott. While little is known of its intervening history, the car was owned for an extended period by Thomas Whiteside of North Attleborough Massachusetts before it was subsequently acquired by the current owner, still finished in its original color.", "Looking for an exceptional example to restore, the consignor sent the E-Type to marque expert Dave Ferguson in Campbell, California. Dave Ferguson, a Jaguar Association chief judge, executed the 18-month, nut-and-bolt rotisserie restoration starting in September of 2012, finishing in December 2013. Finished in beautiful and period-appropriate Cotswold Blue over a red interior, the thoroughly documented restoration incorporates several subtle upgrades in an effort to improve drivability, including a 3.07 rear-end for highway driving, Dynamat sound and heat insulation, an aluminum radiator with a 12-blade cooling fan, a lightened flywheel, and sport camshafts. Furthermore, the car features a full set of tools, jack, and spare wheel as well as an owner\u2019s manual, service manual, and period documentation.", "This particular example will not fail to impress, as it did when it placed 2nd in class at the 2014 Hillsborough Concours d\u2019Elegance.
