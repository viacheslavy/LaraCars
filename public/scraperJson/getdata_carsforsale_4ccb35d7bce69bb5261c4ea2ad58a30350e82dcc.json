Specially built for (obviously) California, it has a number of Shelby-inspired design features, and this particular Meadowlark Yellow coupe shows just 56,265 original miles and comes with a long list of options, including factory A/C.  ", "  You might want to brush up on your GT/CS history because everyone is going to ask you about this car when you're out driving. We're guessing that's why the current owner put the details right there on the windshield. That's the short version, but the long version is that this GT coupe includes a set of Marchal driving lights in the grille, a set of hood pins, side scoops in the quarters with GT/CS right on them, and a Shelby-style ducktail spoiler and Thunderbird sequential taillights out back. There are rumors that this car is based on a coupe that Shelby intended to build but never did, but at every show you're going to get at least one wise guy who will tell you that Shelby never built a coupe. That's when you point at the GT/CS emblems and tell him the story. In the meantime, he can admire the beautiful yellow paint, which was done a few years ago and while not perfect, looks pretty darned nice with those black decals on top. You also get nice chrome, surprisingly good panel fit, and unique California Special emblems on the quarters. This is a car that stands out.  ", "  The interior is a little less unique, carrying black bucket seats and a neatly restore black interior. Fresh carpets, correct door panels, and a deluxe steering wheel make this California Special feel, well, special, and the original owner saw fit to load it up with options, including A/C (could use a recharge), power steering, power brakes, and upgraded gauges that include all the auxiliary dials. An AM/FM/cassette head unit replaces the original AM radio, which is always a nice upgrade if you're going to go driving, and the automatic transmission shifter right there in the center of everything looks great. We're guessing it's a combination of restored and original equipment, but it has a nice all-of-a-piece look. Even the trunk is neatly finished with correct mats and what might even be the original spare tire under its own matching cover.  ", "  A glance at the VIN indicates that this car carries a C-code 289 cubic inch V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor, and that is indeed what you'll find under the hood today. It starts easily and runs great, offering plenty of torque and a smooth demeanor. It's also very well detailed, with Ford Blue engine enamel, a correct air cleaner, and that big A/C compressor up top. This is the car's original, numbers-matching engine, but with so few miles, we're guessing that it has never been opened, just detailed. The C4 3-speed automatic transmission shifts cleanly and with 2.79 gears in the 8-inch rear end, this California Special is built to cruise the highways.

Fresh tires, good interior, super clean paint laid over a rust free body all contribute to a very nice car for a great price. Brand new Vintage Air brand A/C installed and ready to use!!! Heat cool defrost with brand new Factory 68 vents (extra $400)."], "title": "1968 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "110", "price": "29000", "kilometers": 8.045, "total_pages": 6, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27832030", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27832030", "year": "1968", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "V8 5.0L", "Mileage": "5 miles", "Exterior Color": "White", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "RWD", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

with the American Pony Car was born. The Mustang was smaller, lighter, and more nimble that any American manufacturer had produced thus far. This coupled with its fresh design, the Ford Mustang became a must have among the American public. 1967 marked a pivotal year for the Mustang, as this was the first time since the first generation made its debut that vast changes were made to the Mustang. Making it larger and having many more engine options than before. It also eliminated some things that did not make sense. 1968 was just the same and by this point, Ford had found the next best thing and had very little for competition comparatively. So iconic is the Highland Green fastback that Lieutenant Frank Bullitt drove through the streets of San Francisco, that Ford itself has done two modern versions of the Bullitt Mustang--the first in 2001, the second in 2008.", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this recently completed 1968 Ford Mustang GT tribute. It is hard to overlook all the details this car has had done to it. Starting with the exterior the paint has been done impeccably in recognizable and famous Highland Green, with Gold striping that follows the body lines on both the drivers and passenger\u2019s side of this Mustang. According to the owner, no parts of the body have been replaced and the original metal is still intact and looking beautiful. All of the chrome accents look to have a mirror finish including the bumpers and accents around the whole car. Once you are done being in awe of the exterior the interior has been done to the same standard, coming in a new Ivy Gold with the carpet and seats looking like it rolled right off the line. The new and fully functioning gauges, as well as the Philco radio, pumps out the sound. Powering this time machine is a crate 302ci V8 that has all the getup and go, with added HIPO exhaust manifolds, an aluminum intake, and an upgraded AOD 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. This nut and bolt restoration was finished this year and is ready to get back on the road with a new owner, don\u2019t pass this one up!

Bristling with more than 350 horsepower and a Tremec 5-speed transmission, this pretty pony represents an A-list piece of muscle with the goods to deliver on the promises its bodywork makes.  ", "  Finished in a handsome shade of medium green that looks an awful lot like original Lime Gold, this fastback looks exactly like the kind of car that would be prowling Woodward Avenue back in the late-60s. It's subtle but there's no mistaking a predatory Mustang fastback, and we do have to say that it's nice to see one that isn't Highland Green for a change. Build quality is great, with straight sheetmetal, great gaps, and sharp details, all topped by an paint job that's holding up well and has a correct look. Experts will spot the scoops in the quarter panels, which are an aggressive look borrowed from the Shelby parts book, and the dual exhaust protrudes through the rear valence, which is always an awesome look. The chrome bits, including front and rear bumpers, the pony emblem, and the lovely taillights, all appear to be in original condition and look great.   ", "  Two-tone buckets have been restored to factory specifications using correct reproduction seat covers, and thanks to new foam underneath, they're supportive and comfortable. Matching door panels are in great condition, and there are recent carpets on the floor, so it all has a consistent look. That fat wood-rimmed steering wheel isn't stock, of course, but it looks great in the vintage Mustang's interior and shows off the gauges to great effect. Auxiliary gauges have been mounted under the dash in the usual spot, just ahead of the shifter for the Tremec 5-speed manual gearbox, which is a massive improvement to any early Mustang. A new AM/FM stereo head unit has been expertly massaged into the dash, and feeds speakers discreetly hidden out of sight. Open the trunk and you'll find a correct mat, clean sheetmetal, and a full-sized spare with cover.  ", "  According to the extensive receipts that accompany this car, the 351 cubic inch Windsor V8 comes from Fetters Racing Engines, and features World Products heads, a Comp Cams camshaft, an Edelbrock carburetor and intake, and all-new components throughout. Making a dyno-proven 350 horsepower, it barks and snarls like there's a big cam inside and it has been expertly tuned so it runs right. Dress-up pieces include the valve covers and air cleaner, and the ignition system is by MSD. While they had it apart, they also installed a giant aluminum radiator, fabbed up new fuel and transmission cooler lines, and repainted the crossmembers and installed a new oil pan. A rebuilt front suspension and fresh shocks all around improve handling (this might be the best handling fastback we've ever driven), and the ceramic-coated long-tube headers and a new dual exhaust system with X-pipe and stainless mufflers sounds m"], "title": "1968 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "110", "price": "67995", "kilometers": 110826.311, "total_pages": 6, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/28116238", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "28116238", "year": "1968", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 V8", "Mileage": "68,879 miles", "Exterior Color": "Green", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

Getting its horses from a small block Ford V8 and putting power to the rear wheels thanks to a 3-speed automatic transmission, this is what pony cars are all about!  A quick spin of the key fires this baby right up, and boy does she sound angry!  A few quick stabs of the throttle would be sure to gather a crowd at almost any show.  The torque thrust wheels and red stripes on the white paint really complete the look for this classy clone.The interior looks to be the original burgundy vinyl, and it has held up over the years.  No rips or discoloration can be found in the cabin, and the seats feel as comfortable as if they were new.  The music playing from the tailpipes is thrashy and staccato, like that of an 80\u00c3\u00a2??s hair metal band, yet is very welcome, given its origin.  This \u00c3\u00a2??68 Mustang truly is the complete package; all of the sounds, sights, smells, and feelings of a true GT500, but without the hefty price tag!For a real iconic heard-turner, it is hard to pass up on such a clean Mustang.  Options on this \u00c3\u00a2??68 GT500 clone include: AM Radio, Seat Belts, Radial Tires, Vinyl Interior, and Alloy Wheels.  For more information on this beautiful \u00c3\u00a2??68 Ford Mustang GT500 Tribute visit www.GatewayClassicCars.com.
