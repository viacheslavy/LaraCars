The love for jeeps has spanned generations and it still continues to this day.  This one is in great shape for the age.  Yes it has some nicks and chips here in the paint, but nothing major.

The floors are also in great shape in this Jeep.", "Under the hood sits the original 4.2 Liter straight 6.  Jeep people know this motor and love it.  It has been around forever and they ran a couple variations of it all the way up to 2006.  Most die hard jeep people wish they would have never gotten rid of it.  This motor is only rated at about 112 HP but a stump pulling 210 ft lb of torque at  just 2000 RPM.  This motor keeps up with things with 2 more cylinders for about 40 feet out.  The one under this hood runs and drives beautiful mated to a 5 speed manual transmission and the clutch is right and tight.  This jeep does everything that it was meant to do and probably more.  The tires are in great shape as you will see in the pics and this is not a rust bucket with the mud holding the rust together.", "This truly is a jeep that you would be proud to own.  Drive it everyday or make it your trail or beach cruiser, either way, this one needs to be on your property today.  We offer classic car financing for those that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms with as little as 10% down and no prepayment penalties.
