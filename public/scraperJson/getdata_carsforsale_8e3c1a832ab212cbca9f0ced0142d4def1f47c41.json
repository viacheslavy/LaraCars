This V8 powered Mustang is an original, numbers matching \u00c3\u00a2??C\u00c3\u00a2?? Code 289 and Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission, rated at 200 horsepower from the factory. Options on this beautiful coupe include Power steering, Power Brakes with front disc brakes, vinyl interior, Cragar SS wheels, radial tires, seat belts, and it was an original AC car (AC parts are included in the sale).  Stopping power is provided by a slew of new parts including drilled and slotted rotors, master cylinder, brake booster, brake calipers, and brake lines. Other new parts include water pump, aluminum radiator with electric fan, wiring with modern fuse box, fuel tank, Dakota Digital dash that lights up in Indigo Blue, headliner, seats, and more.  Under the hood the 289 is mildly built with Hooker Super Competition headers with dual exhaust and Flowmaster mufflers, Edelbrock 650 CFM 4 barrel carburetor with electric choke sitting on an aluminum Edelbrock Performer series intake manifold, and electronic ignition. The Silver Frost metallic paint was sprayed over a very solid body on this Florida Mustang. The 1967 model year was a redesign of the first generation Mustang and the first year that it had a sister model in the Mercury Cougar. 1967 was also the first year that anything bigger than a 289 was offered in a Mustang, with the introduction of the S code - 390 V8 powered Stangs which are popular for making into Shelby GT500E fastbacks, known as Eleanor from Gone in 60 Seconds. She is ready to cruise or show in style and runs great and has the desired options to be used as a frequent driver as well.

Despite the Mustang's massive popularity, it's still possible to get into a vintage pony car for not a lot of cash, as this 1967 Mustang coupe so ably demonstrates.  ", "  Cars don't come much more popular than this handsome code Q Brittany Blue Mustang, and this neat little coupe offers a lot of pony car for the money. The paint shines up rather nicely and has a wonderful vintage patina that works well on an old Mustang, which, as everyone knows, was heavily revised for 1967. However, America's favorite pony car lost none of its classic good looks and with this car living in the same family since it was new, you know that it's had a pretty good life. Good gaps, straight sheetmetal, and crisp details like the crease that runs from the headlights to the quarter panel scoops all make this car look like it should cost thousands more than it does. There are no body mods, so it still wears a factory hood and Brittany Blue is indeed this car's original color. Nice chrome bumpers and the bright trim along the rocker panels add a lot of interest and the matching blue vinyl top is in very good condition, adding a slightly formal look.  ", "  Remarkably, the interior appears to be almost entirely original and still in good condition. Sure, there's some discoloration and some evidence that it's been driven, but it's good enough that it's worth preserving rather than replacing parts. The driver's door panel shows the most wear, obviously, but it's right on the cusp of needing to be replaced, so we'll let the next owner decide how to proceed: originality or perfection? Fortunately, Mustang parts are insanely affordable, so no matter what you decide to do, it won't destroy your budget. This '67 also features factory air, which was finally integrated into the dash instead of tacked on, and the floor-shifted automatic transmission makes the Mustang feel sporty. Original instrumentation is in nice condition with only minor fading and the entertainment system was upgraded to an AM/FM/cassette head unit some years ago. The back seat is extremely well preserved and the trunk offers a correct mat for an OEM look.  ", "  Ford's rev-happy 289 cubic inch V8 provides plenty of power in the relatively lightweight coupe. The C-code in the VIN denotes a 2-barrel carburetor, so it's reasonably economical to run, too. This particular engine is a rebuilt replacement that was installed in 1997, but it's quite stock and runs great. There's still a 2-barrel carburetor under the stock air cleaner and factory exhaust manifolds ensure that it's quiet and comfortable. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic and with tall 2.80 gears in the 8-inch rear end, this is a great choice for your next road trip. The underside is unrestored and a bit grungy, but we all know trailer queens are no fun and this just means you can get in and go without"], "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "46", "price": "14995", "kilometers": 28569.404, "total_pages": 3, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241907", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241907", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "17,756 miles", "Exterior Color": "Blue", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Blue", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

This 1967 coupe is a lovely car that's a pleasure to drive and delivers a fun V8 Mustang experience that you'll definitely appreciate once you get behind the wheel.  ", "  The Mustang's success was based primarily on its ability to be almost all things to all people, and coupes like this one were the reason why the less profitable and more expensive Mach 1s and Shelbys could exist. Nicely presented, the body is straight with no major signs of repair through the years. The bright Springtime Yellow finish looks authentic and shows a few signs of use and age but nothing that would stop you from jumping in and going for a ride. There are a few touch ups and we do like the recently-installed black stripes along the rocker panels that coordinate well with the matching black vinyl top.  Details are correct throughout, including the grille, emblems, and trademark Mustang gas filler cap out back. Chrome on the bumpers is very nice, and the stainless around the windows has a wonderful patina that looks totally authentic. The aforementioned black vinyl top makes this yellow car look masculine and shows none of the usual signs of trouble underneath. There's no question that this is a very handsome car.  ", "  From behind the wheel, you'll be hard-pressed to determine what's living under the hood, since all Mustangs had beautiful bucket seat interiors. However, this one carries a set of modern chairs that fit so well most folks won't even notice that they're not original equipment. They work well with the new carpet and upscale door panels with woodgrained appliques. The fat steering wheel looks sporty with its three spokes, which also give a great view of the stylish Mustang dashboard full of functional original gauges. Although this car probably came with an AM radio originally, it now carries a Sony AM/FM/CD unit that fits in the original location, so nothing was cut or modified in the process. A slender chrome handle with a wooden knob controls the automatic transmission, and the lack of a console seems to be perfectly appropriate in this pony. You also get factory A/C, which wasn't all that common back in 1967 but is quite welcome here. The trunk is neatly finished with correct mats and a full-sized spare tire with matching cover.  ", "  The engine is a C-code 289 cubic inch V8, which was a popular choice and offered a great balance of power and good manners. Although there's no way to be sure, we're fairly certain this is the car's original engine and it looks quite correct in the Mustang's engine bay with Ford Blue paint, a chrome air cleaner with reproduction decals, and original ignition equipment. It's almost completely stock, which means a thrifty 2-barrel carburetor and standard exhaust manifolds, so it's easy to live with on a daily basis. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic that snaps off quick "], "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "46", "price": "19995", "kilometers": 3636.34, "total_pages": 3, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241734", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241734", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "2,260 miles", "Exterior Color": "Springtime Yellow", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
