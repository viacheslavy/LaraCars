The details: matching-numbers 428 Cobra Jet. Factory A/C. Meadowlark Yellow. 100% ready to rock.", "This gorgeous fastback has been restored to stock specs and that's a good thing when you're talking about Mach 1s. With prices spiking up each year, now is the time to grab one, and this is only the latest in a long line of quality Mach 1s we've seen come and go through our showroom. Code W5 Meadowlark Yellow was rather rare back in 1969 but that rarity makes this car really stand out today. With the restoration on this one being a few years old, you won't be afraid to drive your investment, but it's still nice enough to show up at a regional Mustang Club event and be competitive; it's that nice! Authentic Mach 1 details include the blacked-out hood with scoop, front and rear spoilers, and rear window slats, not to mention the black and yellow graphics along the sides and surrounding the taillights. The chrome, stainless, and Mach 1-specific badges are all in good shape, too. And the combination of the soft color and massive performance is just too cool.", "The interior is correctly restored, too, featuring black Comfort-Weave buckets with red stripes, just as when it was new. It shows a few signs of use, but overall it's quite impressive with no rips or tears, correct red floor mats, and a center console. Ford's mission for the Mach 1 was to be both luxurious and sporty, so options like factory A/C (system works but could use a top-off on the refrigerant) and lots of woodgrained appliques give it a more mature look and feel. The gauges are probably original, but they look great in the deeply-set round pods that house each one, and the 72,890 miles shown are authentic. The AM radio and automatic transmission make this car easy to live with, and perhaps more closely matches the luxury/performance mission Ford envisioned for the Mach 1. Fold-down rear seats also make the Mach 1 sportsroof surprisingly practical, and the trunk is nicely finished with a correct mat and spare tire with cover.", "For your Mach 1, if you wanted the ultimate in performance, you checked the box marked '428 Cobra Jet.' This is the car's original, numbers-matching engine, and it's grossly under-rated at 335 horsepower. It's also surprisingly smooth and torquey, again befitting the Mach 1's split personality. The engine bay is nicely detailed, a result of a high-quality restoration in 2001, and it hasn't been driven much since then. The carburetor is an aftermarket Holley 4-barrel, there's an MSD ignition system, and an aluminum radiator up front, but beyond that, it's quite stock, from the air cleaner showing original decals to stock exhaust manifolds feeding a rumbling Flowmaster dual exhaust system. A C6 3-speed automatic is heavy-duty enough to handle the horsepower and feeds a 9-inch rear full of 3.91 gears, so this is a brutally fast weapon around town, even today. Power disc brakes and power steering are critical to a big block Mustang like this, and the undercarriage shows signs of detailing even though the restoration is older. Modern 17-inch aluminum wheels are replicas of the original Magnum 500s and wear 235/45/17 front and 255/45/17 rear Nitto performance radials.", "Buy this car now or regret it later. Big block Mach 1s are the closest thing to a sure bet in the old car world, and this one is just right for driving while it appreciates.

Their values have been on the rise for years and while that's going on, you have one of the most beloved cars of all time in your garage. This convertible features all the important stuff, ranging from an A-code 289, 4-speed manual transmission, and an awesome color combination, making it a terrific summer cruiser that will make you smile every time you drive it.", "If you're going to have a Mustang convertible, it may as well be a high-visibility GT, right? This one is a real-deal GT and has all the proper hardware to back it up. Painted in 2013, the spectacular black finish is holding up superbly. Sure, it shows a few extremely minor signs of use because nobody can resist the siren song of a V8 pony car in the garage, but this is the kind of car that makes men and women, young and old look appreciatively as it drives by. You'll park it in parking lots and walk away backwards to admire it as you go. Fit and finish are excellent with doors that don't sag and decent gaps all around that closely approximate how the factory did it. It shines up nicely so you'll enjoy waxing it almost as much as driving it, and with red GT stripes running along the rockers, everyone will know this isn't a garden-variety pony. It has also been recently treated to a Sapphire ceramic coating, so it should look this good for years to come. Other GT features include the twin fog lamps in the grille area, shiny chrome exhaust trumpets poking through the rear valence, and, of course, the GT gas cap, all of which give it a slightly more aggressive look than your standard Mustang.", "The red Pony interior was obviously restored not too long ago and you'll find it's easy to get comfortable behind the wheel, like seeing an old friend. The handsome color combination is a nice complement to the shiny black paint, an elegant two-tone look that makes the Mustang feel more expensive than it is. It's fitted with desirable options like a center console and Rally-Pac clock/tachometer on the steering column, plus the interior d\u00e9cor group that includes a wood-rimmed steering wheel and dash panels. The only noteworthy upgrade is an AM/FM stereo in the dash that expands your entertainment options beyond the original AM setup. The original gauges show very good faces and clear lenses, and they all seem to be working the way they should. Overhead, there's a recent white power convertible top that uses a red boot to give the car a trim look, top up or top down. In addition, the trunk wears correct plaid mats and a spare tire with its own cover.", "This is a real A-code car and carries what we believe is the original 289 cubic inch V8. It's still wearing proper Ford Blue paint, a chrome air cleaner with decal, and a set of finned valve covers, all of which are period pieces that still look great. This A-code V8 offers a 4-barrel carburetor and 225 horsepower, making this a sweet-running pony that can still slice through traffic with the best of them. It also includes a big aluminum radiator, a Monte Carlo bar, as well as front disc brakes that were part of the GT package. The ''Toploader'' 4-speed manual transmission shifts cleanly and powers an 8-inch rear with 3.00 gears inside, making this a nice car to drive around town or on the highway. There's also a recent gas tank and a great-sounding dual exhaust system with proper trumpets out back.

The Boss edition mustangs are highly sought after and have been a iconic car for over 5 decades running. There are some great names from the Muscle car era with Pontiac having The Judge Molar and its Super bee yet still I would have to say Ford wins with Boss. Signified mainly by their aero package which included a front splitter a nice wing on the trunk. Powering this beauty down the road is freshly rebuilt 302 CiD V8 which was grossly underrated at 290 HP. Later tests would reveal a 360+ HP number.  The engine has right at 5k miles on it since it was rebuilt & reinstalled into the car to give it plenty of show & go.  The engine is paired to a smooth shifting 5-speed manual transmission that gives this beauty plenty of torque in each gear to making rowing those gears a lot of fun.  The engine bay is very clean and tidy.  All wires have their place and everything looks like it should from the factory.  The engine does have the shaker hood that is functional and it is securely mounted to the air cleaner which also helps with performance.  Those Boss 302 valve covers look awful nice and really give the car a nice look & feel.  The car has undergone a full & complete restoration.  The car is seen in a beautiful color correct Ford yellow with black stripes on each side of the car to give it that authentic & original look.  The paint condition is show car quality and our pictures really do not do this cars finish justice.  The grill bumpers trim lights & glass are all in fantastic condition and need nothing.  All body panel gaps are even & parallel.  The doors open & close with ease along with the trunk & hood.  The rear louvers spoiler & hatch are in like new condition.   There is zero rust on this car and no evidence of any rust repair or body work to be seen.The all black interior is beautiful and contrasts great against the yellow exterior.  The seats are comfortable and free from any tears or rips.  The carpet is very clean and appears brand new.  The dash door panels head liner & center console are all in like new condition.  The rear seats are also in great shape and they fold down easily in case you need to load up some extra tires for the track.  Car retains its original radio with some additional gauges under it to keep an eye on engine management. This car is as clean on the under side as it is on top.  The owner has spent a lot of time & money to bring this car back to its original glory and it is ready for a new home.  This car comes with a Marti report as well.
