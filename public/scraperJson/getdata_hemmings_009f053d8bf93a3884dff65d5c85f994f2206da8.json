This 1968 Camaro is in its original color of Palomino Ivory with the black vinyl top.  It's been dressed up a little with the SS badging making it a nice looking tribute.  It's now powered by a healthy 383 paired with a 3 speed automatic and sounds great through a recently installed dual exhaust.  The interior has had new carpet installed and still has the vinyl bucket seats with a console just as it would have been originally.   The front brakes have been upgraded to  power disc with drums in the rear.  The paint and vinyl top are in very nice shape and would be very presentable whether you're going to a car show, local cruise in or just out for that Sunday drive.  Take a look at the pictures of the underside and you'll see the floors and frame are both in great shape. The engine bay and trunk are both nice and tidy on this car also.  This classic Camaro definitely has some great looks and an outstanding sound. all it needs is a new home and somebody to get it out and enjoy it!
