Take this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible just about anywhere this side of a Super Chevy show, and it'll find a large group of enthusiastic admirers and the new owner will quickly discover that everyone is your friend when you drive a drop-top pony car.", "The bright red paint looks right on the tidy, trim first-generation Mustang shape. While this one was originally Silver Blue, there's no sign of it anywhere, inside or out, suggesting a full disassembly during the restoration and the results were worth it. The finish highlights the car's important parts such as the crease along the tops of the fenders and the famous ''C-scoop'' on the flanks. Fit and finish are pretty darned good for a car that's built to cruise, and you can see even at a distance that the doors and hood fit quite well. The two-stage urethane finish has a decent shine that shows a few swirls and polishing marks, but with a professional buff, this car will sparkle on the show field. Nice chrome bumpers were surely replaced during the cosmetic stages of the restoration and while it packs a V8, it doesn't advertise beyond the usual '289' badges and twin exhaust pipes out back.", "The black interior is correct and replaces the original code 22 Blue upholstery, so you know it has been restored. Handsome bucket seats flank a nicely restored center console, giving this bright ragtop a very upscale look. The '65s still used the wide central speedometer with outer pods for fuel level and temperature, and we're guessing that the instrument panel is original albeit in good shape. A matching black steering wheel works rather well in the monochromatic interior and there's an AM radio head unit in the dash that's probably due for an upgrade for cruising this summer. The dash pad, carpets, and door panels are all in excellent condition and there's a very nicely done white convertible top that folds flush and disappears under a matching black boot. The trunk is also correctly finished with a new reproduction mat and full-sized spare tire assembly.", "Experts will already have glanced at the VIN and noticed that this is a C-code car, meaning a 289 cubic inch V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor and 200 horsepower. You're in luck, because that's what's in there today. Looking quite tidy under the hood, it brings a fat torque curve to the game which makes this Mustang far more entertaining to drive. With chrome valve covers and a matching air cleaner, it has a neo-GT look and those fender braces do make a noticeable improvement in front-end stiffness. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic transmission and an 8-inch rear end which are rugged enough to handle the V8's horsepower, and the car has been fitted with power steering that makes it very easy to handle. The underside of the car is remarkably clean and there's a new gas tank and a recent dual exhaust system hanging out back. It rolls on optional styled steel wheels and they're wrapped in fat 195/75/14 whitewall radials.", "Affordable fun in the sun, that's the Mustang.

For millions, it's probably a 1966 Mustang convertible just like this. With a bubbly 289 V8, classic color combination, and that vintage Mustang charm, it is one legend that certainly lives up to the hype.", "Mustangs always work best in bright, sunny colors and red certainly qualifies. It was repainted at some point, but the color is pretty close to Signalflare Red, which was on the color charts in 1966, so it looks right. It appears that the bodywork underneath was in great shape and nothing has changed in the intervening 50 years, with crisp lines, good alignment, and doors that open and close with reassuring precision. Not trying to be something it isn't, there are no Shelby stripes or even fake GT badges, although it does have a GT rear valence with exhaust trumpets poking through, a look that really should have been standard equipment. There's the grille with running pony emblem, '289' badges on the fenders, and the three-element taillights, all of which make it perhaps the most recognizable car on the planet, and with shiny chrome bumpers it still looks bright and nicely detailed.", "The black interior is the right choice with the red bodywork; red cars with white interiors always look like candy canes or an ambulance. Low back buckets wear correct reproduction seat covers with pleated inserts, and they flank a factory center console with the T-handle shifter. The carpets, dash, and door panels are equally nice and don't look like they've spent decades in the hot sun, so they have surely been replaced along the way, too. Factory instruments in the 5-gauge panel that became standard in '66 look good, and that's a correct 3-spoke steering wheel grip. The factory AM radio is still in the middle of the dash, but it's ready to be replaced by something a bit more contemporary. The black convertible top is in decent shape but looks like it's spent a lot of time folded under the contrasting white boot. Open the trunk and you'll find a reproduction mat, which is sitting on top of a brand new gas tank (yes, the gas tank is the floor of a Mustang's trunk).", "Ford wasn't doing the matching numbers thing in 1966, so we can't tell you whether this is the original 289, but it looks quite correct and has that wonderful small block Ford sound that is a big part of the Mustang's appeal. This is a real C-code car, so all the hardware around it is suitably beefy for the V8's power output (unlike the converted 6-cylinder cars), and it has been smartly upgraded with a 4-barrel carburetor for a bit more power. A few dress-up items like valve covers, red wires, and an open-element air cleaner give it a slightly custom look. It's backed by an effortless C4 3-speed automatic transmission and 3.00 gears out back, so cruising is low-effort, but the engine's torque makes it a lot of fun, and a fresh front disc brake set-up helps you stop. The underside is unrestored, but you can see what we mean about this car taking it easy for the past few decades, and a burbling dual exhaust system gives it just the right soundtrack to earn its Mustang credentials. Factory steel wheels with wire hubcaps and 195/75/14 whitewalls add to the cheerful look.", "This is the new baseline for V8 Mustang convertibles, and they're only going up from here.

Finding one with its rare numbers-matching V8 under the hood, four-on-the-floor, and a premium presentation inside & out means you're looking at rare pony car royalty.", "A high-performance Mustang is often rendered in red or black, but this one goes for a more premium feeling with its factory-correct Caspian Blue.  Only available on 1965 cars, this is an attractive way to stand out.  There has been an investment in a professional respray that gives this one an added depth when the sunlight hits the modern application.  Bodywork is excellent with straight panels and good alignment throughout, which means you can shut the doors with confidence every time.  The brightwork is complete and straight on everything from the mirror-like chrome bumpers to the iconic 289 badges.  And you can really tell this is a first-class pony car by more than just its interesting paint and trim.  The styled steel wheels and are white vinyl roof are part of a total package that announces its premium presence while remaining period-correct.", "There's even more period-correct distinction when you open the door. It starts with the factory-correct blue crinkle vinyl seats.  They coordinate nicely with the side panels, carpeting, dash, and even the exterior paint to give this coupe the appeal of a deep blue ocean.  You get all the great iconic features like the bucket seats, dual cowl dash, and the three-spoke sports steering wheel with pony logo center cap.  But then there are also nice subtle upgrades like the retrosound radio that keeps the classic knob-style appearance while upgrading you to a digital AM/FM tuner with cassette player.  But from the moment you spot the rare Rally-Pac and rest your right hand on the chrome gearshift, you begin to realize how special this '65 Mustang really is.", "As much as you'll love the interior and exterior, it's the rare K-code HiPo 289 cubic-inch V8 under the hood that will impress even the most seasoned Mustang enthusiast.  It's Ford's racing motor that took home the trophies around the globe, and so it's fantastic to have the original numbers-matching powerplant still living in this engine bay.  It has the right amount of flash on the air topper and valve covers that also proudly announce its high performance heritage.  But more importantly, you can see that everything has been maintained correctly on this significant motor \u2013 from the belts & hoses, to the correct decals in the engine bay. With the turn of the key, the dual exhaust gives a high octane V8 symphony, and the four-speed manual transmission makes you its conductor.  The Ford nine-inch rear end has versatile 3.50 gears to give it plenty of punch around town but still cruises reasonably at highway speeds. Plus, the thick sway bar up front is great for handling, and the wide set of BF Goodrich T/As keeps plenty of rubber on the road to truly enjoy this rare performance pony.", "There were only 7,273 K-Code '65 Mustangs ever made.  Just think about how many have been harvested or abused over the last half-century, and then you realize what a treasure a complete and cared for car this coupe really is.

Their values have been on the rise for years and while that's going on, you have one of the most beloved cars of all time in your garage. This convertible features all the important stuff, ranging from an A-code 289, 4-speed manual transmission, and an awesome color combination, making it a terrific summer cruiser that will make you smile every time you drive it.", "If you're going to have a Mustang convertible, it may as well be a high-visibility GT, right? This one is a real-deal GT and has all the proper hardware to back it up. Painted in 2013, the spectacular black finish is holding up superbly. Sure, it shows a few extremely minor signs of use because nobody can resist the siren song of a V8 pony car in the garage, but this is the kind of car that makes men and women, young and old look appreciatively as it drives by. You'll park it in parking lots and walk away backwards to admire it as you go. Fit and finish are excellent with doors that don't sag and decent gaps all around that closely approximate how the factory did it. It shines up nicely so you'll enjoy waxing it almost as much as driving it, and with red GT stripes running along the rockers, everyone will know this isn't a garden-variety pony. It has also been recently treated to a Sapphire ceramic coating, so it should look this good for years to come. Other GT features include the twin fog lamps in the grille area, shiny chrome exhaust trumpets poking through the rear valence, and, of course, the GT gas cap, all of which give it a slightly more aggressive look than your standard Mustang.", "The red Pony interior was obviously restored not too long ago and you'll find it's easy to get comfortable behind the wheel, like seeing an old friend. The handsome color combination is a nice complement to the shiny black paint, an elegant two-tone look that makes the Mustang feel more expensive than it is. It's fitted with desirable options like a center console and Rally-Pac clock/tachometer on the steering column, plus the interior d\u00e9cor group that includes a wood-rimmed steering wheel and dash panels. The only noteworthy upgrade is an AM/FM stereo in the dash that expands your entertainment options beyond the original AM setup. The original gauges show very good faces and clear lenses, and they all seem to be working the way they should. Overhead, there's a recent white power convertible top that uses a red boot to give the car a trim look, top up or top down. In addition, the trunk wears correct plaid mats and a spare tire with its own cover.", "This is a real A-code car and carries what we believe is the original 289 cubic inch V8. It's still wearing proper Ford Blue paint, a chrome air cleaner with decal, and a set of finned valve covers, all of which are period pieces that still look great. This A-code V8 offers a 4-barrel carburetor and 225 horsepower, making this a sweet-running pony that can still slice through traffic with the best of them. It also includes a big aluminum radiator, a Monte Carlo bar, as well as front disc brakes that were part of the GT package. The ''Toploader'' 4-speed manual transmission shifts cleanly and powers an 8-inch rear with 3.00 gears inside, making this a nice car to drive around town or on the highway. There's also a recent gas tank and a great-sounding dual exhaust system with proper trumpets out back. Classic styled steel wheels with 195/75/14 redline radials complete the classic Mustang look.", "A wonderful vintage ragtop that is still as in-demand today as it was 50 years ago and if you're paying attention, this is the Mustang to own.

It's got all the features you want (power top, power steering, A/C, and a 289) plus a color combination that looks great and stands out in a crowd.", "Quite honestly, there's nobody out there who doesn't like the early Mustangs. Even Camaro guys have to admit that they're neat little cars and whenever you're driving one, well, life seems a little brighter. That's why we like this one so much, because the bright yellow paint is impossible not to love (it was originally code R Ivy Green). It embodies the spirit of the Mustang, playful and fun, without taking itself too seriously. Fortunately, the bodywork is quite good underneath and it appears to have lived its entire life down south, so it's tidy underneath. Mustang convertibles can sometimes be tricky to restore with their unit-body structures, but this one fits together quite nicely and with a relatively recent repaint, it shines up well. Is it perfect? No, of course not. But it does have a wonderfully casual look that's a big part of its appeal.", "The black Pony interior contrasts brilliantly with the yellow bodywork and remains as inviting as ever. Given that it was originally equipped with a standard interior, almost everything is new and today it shows only very minor signs of use that are more about character than show-worthiness. The GT-style dashboard covers the vitals and a correct early-style Rally-Pac has been fitted to the steering column. The shifter for the 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission sits proudly on the transmission tunnel, sans console, and there's a period aftermarket A/C system hanging under the dash (needs to be serviced). The woodgrained finish on the dash is in remarkably good condition given the age of the car and the only major modification inside might be the newer AM/FM/cassette radio in the center of the dash. Other neat features include a aftermarket cruise control and a white power convertible top that's in very good condition and offers a matching boot for when it's stowed. The trunk is correctly outfitted with a reproduction mat and spare tire cover so it looks right.", "There's no way to determine if an early Mustang like this is ''matching-numbers'' in the technical sense, but the C-code 289 currently living under the hood looks quite correct and brightly detailed. The C-code cars had 2-barrel carburetors, but this one now carries a fresh 4-barrel, perhaps in the quest for more horsepower, which is never a bad idea. It's quite neatly done, with finned Edelbrock dress-up parts and chrome Monte Carlo bar atop a correct black engine block. It starts easily and feels smooth and torquey, so this Mustang is a great travelling partner no matter where you're going. Power steering is a rather important option, even on a lightweight Mustang, and the automatic transmission teams up with 2.80 gears to make it an awesome highway cruiser. A proper dual exhaust system has a nice V8 burble to it and thanks to a lifetime in a warm climate, the undercarriage is in very good original condition. Handsome styled steel wheels with 205/70/14 blackwall radials are the perfect rolling stock on this bright little ragtop.", "This car gets a lot of things right, and we can guarantee that if you like the color, you're going to love the rest of the car.

As you gaze across the full dash, everything works as it should \u2013 from the heat/defrost sliders to the horn.  But don't forget to spot one nice upgrade.  The radio that looks correct with its bright knob-style appearance, but it's actually a modern AM/FM digital tuner with cassette player.  So cruising with your favorite tunes is a lot easier.", "This is a factory A-code car, which puts it in the heart of GT production.

Even the three-speed automatic transmission is date coded to fit in an originality timeline.  One turn of the key, and the dual exhaust let's people know it's the big dog V8 with its rumble.

There are a few nice touches like gold valve covers and master cylinder cap along with a polished air filter housing dressing up the engine bay.  The power it makes flows back through a 4-speed transmission letting you pick the gear you want to be in for cruising, and a leaf spring rear end gets the power transferred to the ground.   Front disc brakes provide great stopping power to reign in those ponies as needed, and steering control comes from a control arms suspension with coils springs and a sway bar to keep the front end planted on twisty back roads.
