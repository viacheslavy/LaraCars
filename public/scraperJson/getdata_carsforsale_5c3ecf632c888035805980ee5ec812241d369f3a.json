With a smooth running small block, a Hemi Orange paint job that just screams performance, and enough room for the whole family, this bargain-priced piece of muscle is worth a second look.  ", "  This slick 4-door does a great job of disguising its daily-driver roots; with the door handles shaved, a lot of people probably won't even notice the extra two doors! That's purely intentional here, where they took a plain-Jane sedan and gave it a thorough makeover that turned it into a car that earns more of its share of double-takes. Hemi Orange obviously isn't this car's original color, but nobody's going to argue with the finished look of this Coronet, because it looks downright predatory today. Finish quality is extremely good, particularly for a car in this price range, and aside from a few signs of use, it looks quite fresh indeed. Gaps are good, too, and there are twice as many of them here so you know there was plenty of time invested in getting it right. To help with the illusion, most of the emblems were shaved, as were the side marker lights, and with a blacked-out grille, it seems to earn its seat at the muscle car round table. From the back, it looks very much like its brother, the Charger, and the big chrome bumpers are in excellent condition, adding a bit of sparkle that really works.  ", "  The interior got a muscle car makeover, too, complements of a pair of high-back bucket seats that appear to be from another Chrysler product. There are matching gray cloth inserts on the door panels and back seat, so it wasn't a halfway-done conversion and from behind the wheel, this car looks and feels like one of its more sporting 2-door siblings. The original steering wheel is pretty tired, so look into replacing that to help with the illusion, but everything else can stay, including the instrument panel, which is identical to other B-body performance machines. The back seat is notably massive and makes for comfortable seating for real-sized adults, something that can't be said for the 2-door models. There's no radio, but you could easily add one if that's your thing and the giant trunk with a full-sized spare makes this a great candidate for long-distance cruises.  ", "  When you fire it up, there's no question that this Coronet sounds and feels like the genuine article. The 318 small block has about 6500 miles on the rebuild and runs every bit as smoothly as it should. Upgraded with a Holley 4-barrel carburetor and Edelbrock intake manifold, some chrome valve covers, plus long-tube headers, it's definitely got the juice. The massive engine bay leaves plenty of room for service access and they kept it pretty much the way the factory would have done it, including the alternator, radiator, and TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic tra"], "title": "1969 Dodge Coronet ", "total_results": "874", "price": "17995", "kilometers": 19233.986, "total_pages": 38, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/31183498", "brand": "Dodge", "reference_id": "31183498", "year": "1969", "model": "Coronet", "specs": {"Engine": "318 V8", "Mileage": "11,954 miles", "Exterior Color": "Hemi Orange", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Gray", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

Originally this RT/SE was powered by a 383 and a 4-speed.  That drivetrain is long gone and in place is a frightening 600+ horsepower 440 6 pack and a Dodge Viper 6-speed manual transmission.  This wild engine features Indy aluminum cylinder heads and modern Demon carburetors mounted on top of an Edelbrock high rise aluminum 6 pack intake manifold.  The engine was built by well-known Mopar engine builder Muscle Motors out of Lansing, Michigan.  An MSD 6AL brings the engine to life with assistance from a MSD Pro Billet distributor.  Keeping a high performance big block cool can be a tricky one but is no problem for this power plant thanks to an oversized aluminum radiator and a high flow aluminum water pump.  It all breathes through a set of trick headers and stainless steel exhaust tubing, H pipe and Flow Master mufflers.  All 600+ horsepower is sent through a Viper 6-speed and a Dana rear-end.  All this power needs a special suspension and some serious rubber for it to be useable.  The front tires measure 225/70R15 and the rears 295/50R15, both are BFGoodrich Radial T/As and are wrapped around Mopar rally wheels, the rears being a few sizes larger than stock but still retain an original look.  The suspension is by Cal-Trac and certainly makes putting the power to the ground an easier task.  With this much power, you're going to need some serious brakes.  Accomplishing this job is thanks to four-wheel disc and a Wilwood master cylinder.Inside, is a very stock appearing interior.  A beautiful blue vinyl interior greatly compliments the popular B5 Blue exterior.  Stock gauges and bucket seats and a center console housing the pistol grip shifter. If you look closely, the six-speed shift pattern has been added to the shifter.  The shifter is very direct and easy to use and is a significant improvement over the more common shifter ball that you find on other muscle cars.

Take something like this 1974 Dodge Charger SE: it's still fast, fun, and well-equipped, and even at its current price, it's cheaper than almost any new car you'll find. Best of all, you can drive it without losing money, because unlike a new car, it'll still be worth about this much five years from now. How can you lose?  ", "  It's a good-looking car, no doubt about that. Chrysler's fuselage styling has aged well and the classic Sherwood Green and white color combination defies the period in which it was born and will look great for years to come. Proportions are classic muscle car, with a long hood and short deck, and it looks fast even sitting still. While it's got plenty of signs of age and use that come from 40+ years of fun, it also means that you won't mind subjecting it to the rigors of the daily grind and it would make a great candidate for an all-out restoration. The paint has a decent gloss and just a hint of metallic in it, so you'll get admiring glances at any traffic light and the chrome details make it look unlike anything else on the road today. Both bumpers are neat designs that were some of the first to be integrated into the body's shape rather than tacked on, and combined with the unique padded roof treatment, the sucker looks long, low, and sleek. The unique vinyl top is definitely original and showing its age, so it'll be up to you to decide whether to live with it or get it replaced.  ", "  The wild green fabric interior is what makes this car especially cool. Sure, it's a little 1970s funky, but isn't that the whole point? It has to be original, strongly suggesting a very well-maintained car and once you're situated behind the wheel, you'll find that this car feels more modern than its age would suggest. The split bench does a decent impersonation of bucket seats and there's enough room in back for passengers who won't complain about the accommodations. It's got a complete Rallye gauge cluster and it still has its factory-issued AM/FM stereo in the original slot, complete with both knobs on the left side. How cool is that? This car also features factory A/C (needs to be serviced), and a factory Tuff Wheel that is still one of the best designs of the era. There's also a good-sized trunk with what might just be the original spare tire, plus a jack assembly and original mat.  ", "  The relatively potent 360 cubic inch V8 is a great choice if you're going to drive the car regularly (or even just on weekends, for that matter). Torquey and smooth, it remains unobtrusive in traffic but makes great V8 sounds when you open it up. It was the top engine in 1974, and with a 4-barrel carburetor, it's plenty punchy. It's pretty stock, including the air cleaner assembly and corporate turquoise engine enamel, although it looks like the alternator is recent. The 737 TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic powers a set of tall highway gears whi"], "title": "1974 Dodge Charger ", "total_results": "874", "price": "21995", "kilometers": 8125.45, "total_pages": 38, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/31183500", "brand": "Dodge", "reference_id": "31183500", "year": "1974", "model": "Charger", "specs": {"Engine": "360 V8", "Mileage": "5,050 miles", "Exterior Color": "Sherwood Green Metallic", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Green", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

Yes, this 1972 Dodge Charger is everything you want, and more!   ", "  Long, lean, and truly its own car, the 1972 Charger has one of the meanest lines to come out of Detroit.  FE5 Bright Red is such a great color of distinction on these coupes, so it's great to see it in its factory-correct hue shining so brightly.  This Charger's design might be distinctive, but it's also easy to see the legendary DNA running through this car's veins in the hidden headlights, chrome bumper surround, and all the badging.  And speaking of the insignias, you'll showing off the Special Edition script and logo that's on the factory-correct premium vinyl roof.  And premium with a sporty flair is what this coupe really does best.  You can see it in all the details, like the wide dual exhaust tips and Mopar's Mag wheels.  ", "  Black is beautiful, and that's what this highly original interior offers.  You always find interesting components in a Mopar, and it starts here with the front seats.  The button-top design is one of the most distinct and plushest you'll find in a coupe from this era.  And speaking of luxury, the black interior is tastefully broken up by wood paneling on the door panels and all across the dashboard.  The factory three-spoke steering wheel gives you a great view of the dash, which is important, because everything is focused on the driver.  And while everything looks quite period-correct, right down to the AM/FM radio, you'll also pick up on a few nice upgrades.  For example, the Rallye gauge package has had a SunPro tach neatly installed.  And while you won't see your favorite upgrade, you'll certainly feel it with the modern R134a air conditioning.  ", "  Under the hood is a Mopar's 360 cubic-inch V8.  While this motor is already quite powerful, this one has a cool secret.  According to the consignor, this is a '72 Police Interceptor motor.  In fact, it's believed that the cop motors were running the Quadrajet four-barrel carburetors like this one wears today.  This not only makes for a great story at the car shows, but also you'll love it out on the road.  The V8 was rebuilt with plenty of new parts, including a new camshaft.  So this powerful cop motor is running at its finest.  Plus, the growl of the new exhaust confirms your V8 prowess.  And because this SE has been so good at being both sporty and luxurious so far, you're going to enjoy easy driving features like power steering, a Torqueflite 727A three-speed automatic transmission, and front disc brakes.

More subtle than aggressive, it still delivers a big block punch with a stout 383, suggesting that if you have the proverbial big stick, walking softly is purely optional.  ", "  First things first: we dig the Dark Burnt Orange paint. It isn't for everyone and it's certainly very 1970, but on the Chrysler E-bodies, it always looks awesome. We also like the cool combination of the white R/T stripes and blacked out hood treatment, adding to the aggressive look. The paint is in good condition and might just be original, although we're pretty sure the nose has been repainted at some point. Either way, it's a very good foundation for a fast car that's used to getting attention. Panel alignment is quite good and the owners over the years resisted the urge to stick a Go-Wing on the deck lid, so as this car pulls away, you can see how clean it really is. All the original chrome remains in place and in good shape, and the white vinyl top adds a big of sophistication to the brute-force Challenger.   ", "  The interior is pretty stock, and again, we're pretty sure it's mostly original. The seats are miraculously well preserved, with no split seams, no crushed padding, and a minimum of wear marks. Very impressive! A center console is another welcome upgrade and the original dash now carries a full set of factory Rallye instruments including a tachometer and clock. Nice carpets, a dash pad that's in excellent condition, and there are more woodgrained accents on the door panels and center console. The steering wheel is a little washed out, but that's an easy sin to forgive in a car that's this well preserved. FM radio was a big deal in 1970, so this one carries a fully operational factory AM/FM head unit that's a bit of a rare find and the trunk is very neatly outfitted with a correct mat and full-sized spare tire assembly.  ", "  But the real story on this car is underneath all that Burnt Orange paint, a thumping 383 cubic inch V8 that pulls hard and loves to rev. Lifting the hood on a compact muscle car and finding this much engine underneath is always impressive, and with the nicely dressed engine, there's a lot to see. It's likely that this is the original engine, but we haven't confirmed, and it certainly looks the part with a correct twin snorkel air cleaner and Hemi Orange paint on the block. There's an Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor under that air cleaner and finned Mopar Performance valve covers were added at some point, but that seems to be the extent of the modifications. The TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic transmission happily churns the power aft to a beefy 8.75-inch rear end, so you probably don't have to worry about breakage unless you do something crazy. Long-tube headers and a rumbling dual exhaust system provide a spectacular engine note and it's tidy if not detailed for show underneath"], "title": "1970 Dodge Challenger ", "total_results": "874", "price": "43995", "kilometers": 104893.928, "total_pages": 38, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/31114716", "brand": "Dodge", "reference_id": "31114716", "year": "1970", "model": "Challenger", "specs": {"Engine": "383 V8", "Mileage": "65,192 miles", "Exterior Color": "Dark Burnt Orange Metallic", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Brown", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

That's exactly why you're attracted to this 1973 Dodge Challenger R/T tribute.  But more than just a sleek and sinister appearance, this one backs up its muscle machine looks with a big Magnum 440 V8.  But we suggest you look over the great paint and nicely coordinated interior first, because once you heart the big block roar, you'll instantly fall in love/lust.  ", "  This coupe is out to get all the right attention.  Its blue has a metallic hue to give it an electric-level shine the you know will look great no matter if its reflecting the car show sunshine or midnight neon.  Plus, the complete set of black R/T stripes accents the curvaceous rear end sheetmetal.  We know you love the shine that comes from the re-dipped bumpers, hood pins, and those 15-inch REV alloys (that are larger in the rear to tell everyone that serious power is meeting the pavement.) But the most aggressive elements are in satin black.  The hood treatment highlights the ram air openings, and the large rear wing and matching tail panel offer a menacing finishing touch.  ", "  Mopars of this era have always been a nice place to spend some time, but this one goes the extra mile with a well-coordinated black and blue interior.  This Challenger goes for both a premium and a sporty feeling with all the right elements.  It starts with bucket seats and desirable center console. The woodgrain in the center nicely coordinates with the dash for the right period-correct feeling.  In fact, this one goes for so much originality, that even the AM/FM 8-track stereo is still working!  But this cool Mopar does also have a nice upgrade.  When you look through the factory sports steering wheel, it gives you a clear view of an upgraded full gauge package, including a large tach.  This has a cool blue glow in the darkness, which reminds you that even this upgrade was part of a thoughtful package.  ", "  When you look in the engine bay, you'll be happy to know that the bright air topper isn't lying.  This really is powered by the almighty Magnum 440 cubic-inch V8.  And more than just having the famous performance big block, this one is enhanced with a four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock aluminum hi-rise intake, and Edelbrock aluminum heads.  And because the headers add power as well as contribute to the rumble of the dual exhaust, this screamer of a motor can be used to intimidate the rest of the muscle car crowd.  But if all you want to do is take your Challenger on a midnight cruise, then you'll be thankful for features like the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and front disc brakes.

"51933", "description": ["This is one of the most desirable muscle cars you can find.  The 1970 Dodge Super Bee is rare, fast, and has one of the most unique styles to come from Detroit's days of street domination.  So when you can find one with its correct Plum Crazy paint, 51933 actual miles, and the original 383 under the hood, you realize this is exceptional muscle car fruit that's ripe and ready to be picked.  ", "  The styling for 1970 was pretty unique for this one model year.  The super-hot Super Bee packaged muscle cars had a seriously mean appearance with the wide dual grille that truly looked a bit like bumble bee wings.  These separated grilles are particularly great on this muscle machine because they drive attention to the aggressive dual hood scoops.  Straight bodywork is especially critical on Mopar's iconic block B-body cars, because while these were the midsize offering, the stylists knew how to give them the look of unflinching full-size authority.  And you can see from the unbroken curves on this one's flanks that the bodywork was done well. These Mopars had a long list of fun and funky paint options, and arguably none were better than this factory-correct Plum Crazy.  It looks especially great today thanks to an investment in a modern respray that knows how to shimmer in the sunshine.  But more than just the High Impact color, this one has all the great details, such as the Super Bee white striping, matching white roof, Mopar Mag wheels with Goodyear Polyglas tires, and the Super Bee mascot properly placed all around the coupe.  ", "  We love it when the exterior trim color is a preview of the interior color.  It gives a car the kind of uniform feeling that will have plenty of people sticking their heads into this pillarless hardtop to get a closer look.  When they do, they'll see a solid investment in getting this Dodge looking right.  The driver and passenger get high back vinyl bucket seats that are a nice reminder that the Dodge Coronet (basis for the Super Bee) was an all-day cruiser.  The rest of the interior is fresh and clean, which makes it all feel like a 1970s time capsule.  There's plenty of wood paneling on the center console and dash, and the factory three-spoke steering wheel is equal parts grippy, and artful.  ", "  You've already seen those racing hood pins on the front of this car, and you already know Super Bees only came with serious power, so you must know that this coupe doesn't disappoint.  The 383 cubic-inch big block V8 does a good job of filling every inch of the very tidy engine bay.  It's painted in the correct shade of Hemi Orange, and as you can tell from the state of all the components, the powerplant has had a lot of service and care.  In fact, this V8 is believed to be the original motor, which always adds serious value to this Mopars.  It inhales deeply through a Holley four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority from the newer dual exhaust.  Out on the road, you have comfortable features like power steering and a three-speed automatic to make this muscle machine a comfortable cruiser, too.   ", "  Mopars are already some of the rarest muscle cars on the scene, and this coupe is one of the scarcest desirable Dodges around.  The paint says, Look at me! but the low production numbers and throaty exhaust screams, You will remember me!

Nice Driver Quality paint showing nice gloss & shine. The color is consistant on all panels,...but this is only a Nice Paint Car,...not show quality.  I think a Wet Sand would do wonders,...and bring it up several notches on the Quality Ladder.  Otherwise,...expect a good lookin' car that while may not be perfect,...it's nice enough to be very proud of.   The Vinyl Top is full color and nice.   The Chrome Wheels are a great look.   The Street Stance is Mean.   The Chrome Trim & Monikers & Emblems are nice.   Grill & Rear Panel Inserts are nice as well.   The Glass is Clean & Clear.   Overall,...and still allowing for the average paint,...this Challenger still gets all the attention,...it's a good lookin' Muscle Car.   The Interior.   Beautiful inside,...one of the better Mopar Interiors I've seen in a while.   Nice Seats.  Nice Original Dash Pad.   Nice Headliner.  Nice Door Panels.   Clean Rugs & Mats.

Factory Undercoat Saved this E-Body!  In Closing.   This is my favorite body Challenger. I like the approach the last owner took to bring some performance with the 340....it's a great color and it's solid.  Above all,...this car drives really well.  Okay,...so the paint is not show car like,...but like I said,...a wet sand would take it there,...or close enough.  Please expect a very nice car without it being perfect.  I'm pretty picky,...and I'd love to own it.   Schroeder Motors is located 1 mile south of I-70 on Hwy. 94 in St. Charles, Missouri...and only 10 minutes from the St. Louis International Airport.
