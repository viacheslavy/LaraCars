When's the last time you saw one of these Swedish sports car rolling around at the local show? With smooth and sexy lines, this '72 Volvo for sale is one lovely looking European cruiser. Powering this little Volvo is a 1800 cc inline 4-cylinder engine fitted from the factory with dual carburetors. Opening up the engine bay, the side mounted carbs are truly a sight to see, encouraging others to gather around and stare. Backing the 4-cylinder is a 4-speed manual transmission with overdrive. A fun revving 4-cylinder euro sports car with a stick shift transmission, does it get any better than this? The exterior is borderline exotic, due to a couple of custom pieces that really make this Volvo pop! Adorned in a lovely shade of Red, this P1800 almost has a Ferrari type appeal. Staring at the front of this P1800 for sale, you're taken back by the custom hood scoop, which also gives this Volvo a dash of British appearing flair. The smooth lines work their way to the rear, becoming sharp and abrupt, trickling off out back like a cascading waterfall. With just enough chrome and polished trim to add some class to this ride, this Volvo is the best of both worlds. The class and luxury factor is continued throughout the cab. The Tan vinyl interior is clean and smooth, covering the front bucket seats, which just beg to be sat in. With  shifter jutting back just begging to be shifted, it's hard not to want to drive this P1800. Options on this Volvo P1800 for sale, include: A/C, AM/FM radio with Bluetooth, power brakes, seat belts, vinyl interior, and aluminum/alloy wheels wrapped in radial tires. Now's your chance to get into one cool and custom Swedish collector car! To see more HD pictures and video please visit GatewayClassicCars.com.

HIS LOSS, YOUR OPPORTUNITY.", "We are pleased to offer this 1982 Volvo DL (240) two door.  It is famous in Volvo collector circles.  One owner, it was in Canada and when it went to Volvo car shows, it always came away with a trophy for originality and  condition.  The maintenance records are intense and complete.   This car has never missed any maintenance and has always had its oil changes ahead of schedule.   There are no aftermarket parts on this car, as the owner would only use parts from the Volvo dealer.  The body and paintwork are as new. The interior is all original and incredible.  Mechanically, this has to be the most coddled Volvo in North America.   Interestingly, it was built in Nova Scotia and has a large label in rear window indicating that it is a Canadian built car.  The Canadian spec car for 1982 had a single carburetor and points ignition. I have put an electronic distributor from a USA spec car for maintenance purposes, but the points distributor is ready to reinstall in minutes and the wiring is intact.  It is hard to believe that a 33 year old car can look like this and run like this, but it is a tribute to the appreciation Volvo owners can have for their cars. It is ready for display, touring, or just driving around town.  Everything from the tires to the brakes to the cooling system and more are all ready for what every you hand to this exceptional car.   More photos will be posted later.  Please call ahead for your preview of this car, as we do not have it in the display in front of the shop   989 835 4430"], "title": "1982 Volvo 240 ", "total_results": "39", "price": "11770", "kilometers": 225260.0, "total_pages": 3, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/11848581", "brand": "Volvo", "reference_id": "11848581", "year": "1982", "model": "240", "specs": {"Engine": "Overhead Cam 4", "Mileage": "140,000 miles", "Exterior Color": "Burgundy", "Transmission": "5 Speed", "Interior Color": "Grey", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

It has lots of cargo space for groceries and even the extra 3rd seat to provide seating for up to 7. (My kids think it's fun to ride there.) Here is the work we have done Replaced the Gas tank and Fuel Line to Engine Fuel pump Replaced new headlight switch New alternator New battery in 2014 New exhaust in 2016. It has AC added by its original owner but it presently doesn't work. We haven't looked into what is wrong with it. When our mechanic replaced the fuel pump he converted it to that of a 1997 Bonneville. It is cold-blooded so you must give it a couple of minutes with your foot on the gas to warm it up. I suspect that a mechanic familiar with this Volvo engine could tweak the fuel mixture to help it out. The glass is all in very good condition as is the interior. (It was re-upholstered in 2014.) Apparently the previous owner replaced the dash with that of a GT. The odometer reads 38000 but I suspect that it may not be accurate though it was sold to me as accurate. It must be noted that this is an old car (in car years) and as such it will continue to need things restored. I am hoping that someone who loves the classic Volvo automobiles will adopt this very special example of one and continue its restoration.Vehicle is located in Richmond MO.

The sloping lines of the PV444 were similar to a pre-WWII Ford, but the series made huge waves with the reliability and performance of the mechanicals. So much so, the 544 was even used in the American SCCA racing class and also won the Safari Rally in 1965. This car is certainly a rare and fun vehicle for collector's who thrive on having something different to cruise in and show off. According to the Volvo sales brochure from 1963 \u201cThe Volvo 544 is incomparable in its class. It is economical and east to drive but at the same time has a high degree of comfort with plenty of room.\u201d ", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this frame-up restoration example of a 1963 Volvo 544. Since the restoration was done in the past decade the car was not driven much, just shown off and deserving so! Coming in a brilliantly done Red exterior with mirror like finish on the bumpers and accent pieces this is certainly an eye catcher. The interior is in a like new Red and Cream vinyl with no visible rips, tears or marks. When the car was released it came with an instrument cluster that included speedometer, fuel gauge, odometer, and trip meter as well as warning lamps for charging, oil pressure, high beams and turn signals. During the restoration, these have all be updated and are functioning, including the windshield wipers, AM/FM radio, and heat which blows hot.  According to the owner, the 1.8L inline-4 has been rebuilt and using a fully synchronized 4-speed manual transmission with a floor-mounted shifter. The era correct 15\u2019\u2019 wheels have BF Goodrich radials that have front independent suspension with coil springs and control arms.

Now having the car here in Chicago, we wholeheartedly agree with his assessment.", "Exterior:", "Looking at the color codes on the VIN tag under the hood, the car was originally pearl white with red interior. Now, fifty years later, the car wears teal metallic paint with tan interior. While they couldn\u2019t be farther apart, both are excellent color combos. Metallic has a nice deep sparkle to it under direct light. Paint is the textbook definition of a ten-footer. Looks phenomenal from ten feet away, but under close inspection has some faults. There\u2019s some bubbling around the driver\u2019s side headlight, as well as a handful of rock chips and light scratches scattered around the car. Chrome is very nice throughout; front and rear bumper appear to be new, as does the chrome trim around the lights. Front grille has some dings in it. Lights are all intact and functional, roll up windows all track well, and glass is all clear and crack-free, with the exception of a tiny nick on the lower windshield. Wheels are in nice shape; there are some very light dings on a couple of the chrome hubs, but no curb rash.", "Interior:", "We really like the interior of these cars, they\u2019re ergonomically perfect. The driving position provides good visibility, and the placement of the gear lever feels just right. Brake pedal and accelerator are perfectly staggered and close, making for some great downshifting. Another thing we really like about the interior of this car is the rubber floormats in place of carpeting. This just adds to the \u201cdriver\u201d nature of the car, hop in with muddy shoes and don\u2019t think twice about it. With the exception of the leather dash cover peeling up off the metal dash, the interior is in very nice shape. Tan leatherette seats are comfortable and free of any scratches, scuffs, or tears. Both front and rear seats are very nice, but the rears are so mint they look to have never seen use. White headliner is tight and in as-new condition. Original steering wheel is in nice shape. Gauges are all functional. The original radio remains in place, though there is a Kenwood KDC152 mounted below the dash, Quinn speakers sound great. Wipers, lights, and fan are all functional. No air conditioning. Doors open and close without any fuss.", "Under the Hood / Underbody:", "This is where this car really shines. First off, it\u2019s in excellent shape underneath. Having been in the dry, no-salt state of North Dakota, the car hasn\u2019t suffered from rust issues. Please take a good look through the underbody photos \u2013 there isn\u2019t even surface rust to note. I continuously say that this car is a \u201cdriver\u201d\u2026.it\u2019s truly a blast to drive. The car starts right up, idles cool, shifts buttery smooth, and stops very well. It\u2019s surprisingly peppy too; while the car was originally equipped with the somewhat anemic B18 motor, the car now runs a fuel-injected B20, which was a larger, more powerful evolution of the B18 first introduced in 1969. Now with around 130hp on tap and a four-speed manual, this little Volvo really gets moving. Odometer reads 40,654 miles, though the motor is not original to the car.", "Overall, this is an interesting car with serious charm. It truly needs to be driven to be understood and appreciated. I cannot stress how good this car feels on the road. The smiles-to-dollars ratio is STRONG.

The P1800 featured styling by Pietro Frua and mechanicals derived from Volvo's Amazon/122 series.  The ES's rear backrest folded down to create a long flat loading area. As an alternative to the usual four-speed plus overdrive manual transmission, a Borg-Warner three-speed automatic was available in the 1800ES.
