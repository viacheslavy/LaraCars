To many, these are the most desirable Triumphs.  This is driven by a unique combination of several elements.   \u00b7         They are stylish examples of an open British sports car. \u00b7         They have excellent parts availability. \u00b7         Their drive trains are solidly reliable. \u00b7         They\u2019re usable in modern traffic, especially the overdrive equipped cars. \u00b7         They\u2019ve seen steady appreciation in value. \u00b7         They\u2019re still one of the most affordable collectible sports cars.  The 1972 model here predates the federally mandated impact bumper requirement so its looks aren\u2019t spoiled by massive rubber bumper guards.  It\u2019s also equipped with overdrive so it can cruise at highway speeds while maintaining low engine revolutions.  More important, is this car\u2019s great overall condition.   Due to the TR6\u2019s affordable cost, few have been treated to a frame off restoration.  This car is one of those exceptions.  As the photos show, the frame and underside are all in fine shape.  The interior is quite nice and the wood dash is excellent in condition and appearance.  It has the correct convertible top with reflective trim stripes.   The body is very solid without any rust issues.  The paint has a great shine and presents well.  However, it is an older restoration and a very close examination will reveal some minor age related paint flaws.  That said, these aren\u2019t apparent to a casual observation and we feel the paint will be serviceable for years to come.   More subjectively, this car has a nice tight feel to it not unlike a very low mileage car.  From the time you start the engine, pull away, shift gears, drive, turn, and stop, it just feels right.
