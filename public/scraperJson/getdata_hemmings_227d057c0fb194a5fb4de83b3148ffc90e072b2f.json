No winters, everything works, runs and drives very well. Fantastic color combination, top works properly, leather in very good condition. Very affordable Mercedes-Benz fun!", "The color is called Sunburst Yellow, and it may be a bit showy for traditional Mercedes-Benz customers, but on a lightweight, fun roadster, it's just about the ideal choice. Obviously a car like this isn't a daily driver and a powerful rear-wheel-drive convertible is a terrible idea in the snow, so it has never seen harsh weather and is therefore not rusty or structurally compromised like so many of its rust-belt siblings. The paint shines up quite nicely and while it's been touched up here and there over the years, but none of it detracts from the clean overall look. The only notable demerits are a scuffed chin spoiler and the rear-mounted antenna is a little limp, but otherwise it's pretty darned nice. And when you head out, it still attracts more than its fair share of attention out on the road. Hey, nobody has to know how affordable it is!", "The charcoal gray leather interior is likewise nicely preserved. As a Mercedes-Benz (this car cost nearly $50,000 when it was new, and those were 2001 dollars!) everything is standard equipment, from power seats, windows, locks, and mirrors, to a powerful HVAC system to the dramatic folding hardtop. Better still, you know it all works properly, with the only notable issue being that the thermometer seems to read about 40 degrees too cold\u2014I'm sure you can deal with that. The driver's outer bolster shows the most wear since this is a high-traffic area, but it's not critical and certainly in line with the car's age and mileage. Other goodies include heated seats, which are awesome in a convertible and really extend top-down season, traction control that gives this car the moves of a much lighter vehicle, and a 5-speed automatic transmission that always seems to be in the right gear. The big button on the console automatically raises and lowers the top, including latching and unlatching it from the windshield header and powering the quarter windows into position. All you need to do is hold the button and open-air motoring is a few seconds away. And unlike Ford's retractable hardtops, this one retains a usable trunk that's accessible the conventional way, making the SLK a no-compromises little roadster.", "With 215 horsepower and 229 pounds of torque, the 3.2 liter V6 is remarkably strong in such a small package and the SLK never feels overwhelmed. It scoots through traffic with impressive agility and if you punch the throttle and let it unwind, there are plenty of Mustang owners who might be surprised. The stout V6 emits a distinctive howl from the exhaust that's worth the price of admission by itself. This one hums like a tenor but never annoys and on the highway with the top up, it just whispers along, barely audible. The aluminum block and heads help keep curb weight down around 3100 pounds and the engine bay is extremely clean, again showing a car that has not seen heavy winter weather. It's completely stock and very well maintained, including a recent coil pack service that cost about $2000.", "Turn the key and the SLK sparks to life instantly and idles perfectly, even when it's cold. Drop it into gear and the engine's torque pulls it around with enthusiasm and the 5-speed automatic shifts seamlessly. The suspension is, of course, fully independent and delivers a nice compromise between sporty handling and excellent ride quality, with an edge towards keeping you comfortable. Large 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS keep you safely out of trouble and the exhaust system, as I mentioned, has a great sound and has plenty of life left in it yet. No major structural rust, just the usual road grime and surface scale underneath, so you can buy this car and enjoy it for years to come. Factory alloys are in excellent condition and wear staggered 205/55/16 front and 225/50/16 rear performance radials.", "Just a cool little car with lots of luxury and performance for a shockingly small price. If you like the prestige of the three-pointed star, this is a great example and nobody else will know just how reasonable it is to own. This is a car that just gets everything right.

Exceptional investment-grade Corvette.", "Admiral Blue with Arctic White stripes and red hashmarks was exclusive to the Grand Sport and was the only way you could get it.  By 1996, after 12 years of production, they'd pretty much perfected the C4 so build quality is exceptionally good throughout and the paint has a shine that belies its age. Obviously few buyers used their Grand Sport as daily transportation, and that's obviously the case here\u2014we're pretty sure this car has never been wet. All the paint is original, there are no dings or chips, not even on the nose, and even the chin spoiler is remarkably bereft of scrapes and scratches. This one is beautiful in every way, and there are likely lower-mileage cars out there, they probably aren't any nicer.", "You could choose black leather or torch red, and black seems like the safe choice. Custom interior touches include \u2018Grand Sport' embroidery on the seat backs, but for the most part it sticks to the same formula that made the C4 such a comfortable cruiser. The combination of analog and digital gauges was an effective way to convey important information and you'll note that the LT4 engine has a 6250 RPM redline, up 500 RPM over the LT1. Just about everything was standard, including power seats, windows, locks, and mirrors, a powerful climate control system, an AM/FM/cassette/CD stereo system, and a trip computer. The driver's seat shows some very minor comfort marks, but certainly no damage and a set of carpeted floor mats with red piping were added to keep the carpets looking their best. A white top was the only choice, and it's the model of folding top simplicity, stowing under the rear deck in seconds. A heated glass rear window is standard, too.", "Mechanically, the Grand Sport carries the most powerful small block V8 up to that time, adding 30 horsepower to the LT1's 300. Bigger injectors, a revised camshaft, more compression, larger vales, and roller rockers all contribute to the LT4's rev-happy nature. The redline was raised and there's noticeably more punch at any speed, particularly in third gear, and the Grand Sport is still formidable in this age of 600 horsepower Corvettes. The LT4 is easy to recognize with its red intake manifold and plug wires, and a \u2018Grand Sport' badge on the throttle body. Obviously this one is completely unmodified and given its status as an A-list collector's item, it hasn't been raced or abused. Turn the key and it springs to life instantly, idles relatively smoothly (remember those upgrades), and makes plenty of oil pressure. The exhaust system still has its original catalytic converters and mufflers, so it's 100% legal in every state, and OEM reliability is unaffected. This car will run practically forever.", "The only transmission available with the LT4 was the ZF 6-speed manual, one of the slickest gearboxes you'll find behind a small block V8. Out back, there are 3.45 gears on a limited slip, and that's plenty of gear for the torquey 350 to get it rolling with authority. Towering overdrive gears on 5th and 6th mean that it just loafs along at highway speeds and if you're careful, you can pull down 25 MPG on long trips. Nice, right? This car is also equipped with the optional $1695 F45 adjustable suspension, which narrows the production range down to just 76 Grand Sport convertibles so equipped. Corvette brakes have always been powerful and are still carrying their factory brake pads, and the exhaust has a nice growl that never gets annoying. 17-inch A-Mold wheels from the ZR1 were part of the Grand Sport package, this time painted gloss black and wearing Goodyear GS-C tires, which are indeed original-issue (we recommend replacing them if you're going to drive the car extensively).", "Grand Sport convertibles are obviously a rare commodity and they rarely come up for sale. The ZR1 seems to be struggling to find its way onto collectors' must-have lists, but a Grand Sport convertible will always be a first-rate collectable, and you don't have to love Corvettes to want one. Great cars will always be great, and that's never been more true than with this Corvette's unique combination of style, rarity, and performance.

Custom one-off 2-door phaeton body, ZZ3 crate motor, gorgeous interior and gauges. 13 miles since completed, a 100% new rod ready to show or cruise.", "There's a lot going on here that you'll miss at first glance, but you can instantly see that the color and style not only take it back to the days of traditional hot rodding, but also take a different path, making this a rod that stands out in a big way. The body is a custom fiberglass Deluxe 2-door phaeton, which, if you're a Ford fan, you know is one of the rarest of all body styles. It appears to be a one-off, as we can't find it in anyone's product catalog today, and the workmanship is extremely good. The car was professionally built by the crew of a former race car team owner, so you know they know what they're doing and you know they're familiar with going fast. Finish quality is exceptional, with glossy, smooth surfaces that show clear, crisp reflections, all a product of taking the time to get it right. Door fit is better than anything Henry Ford was building in 1931 and we love the simplicity of the look with no extraneous chrome, no door handles, nothing that will get in the way of going fast. Isn't that the point?", "We know that the brown paint will be polarizing, but the car looks fantastic in the flesh and, like I said, if you're man enough to want to stand out, this car will do it without resorting to over-the-top garishness. Look at the detailing and you'll see professionals at work: a '32 grille shell with a billet insert, a fantastic custom hood ornament that suggests speed (we don't know what kind of car donated it), and those cool vintage Guide headlights with marker lights built right in. For pure style points, we love the custom leather belts holding the hood in place, and the simplicity of the 2-door phaeton body style. Chrome spreader bars, original-looking reinforcement ribs in the rear wheel housings (this is a \u2018glass car, it doesn't need them, so that's pure style, too), and the slightly clipped windshield all give it the look of a car that was built a long time ago.", "The custom-stitched interior takes this tub a few steps above the average old-school rod, using black and tan leather for a first-rate experience. The diamond-tufted inserts have an elegant look and the contrasting light stitching and French seams make this car look highly polished. That front seat is also adjustable, so anyone can get comfortable behind the wheel, especially with a modern tilt column to assist. The wheel is a billet piece that looks like a vintage banjo and the lovely cream-faced gauges were custom-made to match by Classic Instruments. Neat storage pockets in the doors will turn out to be handier than you expect and there's plenty of space in the back seat for real-sized people. There's no top, no heater, no radio, so if you're hurting for those things, maybe this isn't the right car for you. This is about the experience.", "Some of you older hot rodders will glance at the engine and think \u201cOldsmobile\u201d but it's actually a tried-and-true 350 cubic inch Chevy V8 wearing some way cool valve covers that look a lot like a set of vintage Rocket V8 parts. The engine itself is a ZZ3 Chevy crate motor with aluminum heads and topped by a big Holley double-pumper and a Weiand intake manifold. An electric water pump keeps the nose of the engine looking clean and it's often a better solution, because it can circulate coolant even in traffic. It's also beautifully tuned, starting instantly, idling well even when it's cold, and you can imagine that with so little weight to pull around, its 330 horsepower makes it alarmingly fast. The ceramic-coated headers look aggressive, but they have baffles built in to control sound, so it's easy on the ears and you'll find that it burbles along happily without being obnoxious.", "Underneath it's a fresh frame with '32 side rails, all painted gloss black. The front suspension is a traditional 4-bar with a dropped I-beam axle and transverse leaf spring, and there's a disc brake perched on each end. A Ford 9-inch rear is complete overkill on a lightweight car like this, and it, too, hangs on a 4-link setup with adjustable coil-over shocks. The transmission is a TH350 3-speed automatic to make it exceptionally easy to drive and with 3.50 gears out back, it's a comfortable high-speed cruiser that feels punchy around town. New steel wheels and reproduction V8 hubcaps with trim rings give it a vintage look and carry staggered performance rubber.", "Simple and elemental, this is where hot rodding started. But with a dash of 21st century finish quality, it becomes a show-quality car that's ready to go anywhere. With just test and tune miles on it, it's totally fresh and unmarked. If you're the kind of guy who dares to be (just a little) different, this cool little Ford is calling your name.

Fresh professional build. Pat Musi built 427, 5-speed manual, aircraft-inspired interior, show-quality paint and bodywork. Insanely fast yet beautifully finished '32 Ford roadster.", "Now this isn't a vintage build, it's brand new, based around a complete 1932 Ford Pro Street Roadster package from ScottRods in Monroeville, Ohio. It's called HellRazor and you'll see that it earns its name honestly in a moment. HellRazor was a cost-no-object built that takes everything to the extreme: power, looks, tires, and even the interior, which offers ultra-cool aircraft-style aluminum buckets. Some of it's traditional and some of it is pure hardcore, including the Pat Musi 427 cubic inch Windsor small block living ahead of the firewall and making somewhere north of 550 horsepower. The body is extreme, too, paring the '32 Ford roadster down to its barest essence: shaved, smoothed, and simple so that there's nothing to add weight or drag. Hell, just check out the trick raked-back windshield that's designed to cheat the wind. The \u2018glass was expertly smoothed and sanded, and even though ScottRods puts out some pretty darned nice stuff, there's nothing that's perfect out of the box. There's a lot of time invested in getting the doors to fit better than any production '32 ever did, and the surfaces are impossibly smooth and straight. Why go to all this effort? Because that vivid orange paint costs $3500 a gallon, mostly because it has crushed diamonds in it. Yep, you read that right: diamonds. Our photos don't do it justice\u2014you need to see this rod in the sunlight to really appreciate the spectacular finish and it stops traffic wherever it goes. Nobody will ever accuse this of being \u201cjust another '32 roadster.\u201d", "The interior was inspired by aircraft design and the centerpieces are those gorgeous aluminum chairs that actually are comfortable enough for cruising. Exposed rivets add to the aircraft vibe and is echoed in the fasteners for the hand-stitched leather door panels and body panels. The fat banjo-style steering wheel has a vintage look but it's easy to grab, because, honestly, you're going to need both hands when you crack the throttle, and it sits on a polished tilt column so this '32 is far more comfortable than many of its less extreme peers. Classic Stewart-Warner gauges are in the hand-hewn aluminum instrument panel, adding to the throwback look, and they all spring to life when you turn the key. There's a switch between the seats that powers open the rumble seat lid, where you'll find a finished trunk and remotely-mounted battery.", "The heart of any hot rod is the powerplant, and this Ford is 100% Ford thanks to a 427 cubic inch V8 built by the legendary Pat Musi. We have receipts totaling almost $18,000 for the engine alone and dyno sheets to prove the horsepower numbers, and you'd better believe that it makes this Ford entertaining to drive. Upgrades include a gorgeous Hogan sheetmetal intake ($2800) and dual quads ($1500), plus $400 worth of custom sheetmetal valve covers. Inside the Dart small block Ford block you'll find a Scat crank and rods, Mahle aluminum pistons, Clevite bearings, and a nasty thumping cam. Up top there's a pair of aluminum Edelbrock Victor Jr. heads, Harlan Sharp rocker arms, and those two gorgeous QuickFuel 850s feeding it. Most of the parts attached to the engine are shiny polished aluminum or chrome and those beautiful long-tube headers not only look cool but sound spectacular. Be sure to check out the custom polished stainless firewall, which uses the same button-head screws as the interior, continuing the aircraft theme.", "The transmission is a Tremec TKO600 heavy-duty 5-speed manual that's one of the sweetest-shifting heavy-duty transmissions in existence and it transforms the hi-boy roadster into a car that's actually usable in today's traffic. The tall overdrive works with the 3.73 gears in the 9-inch Ford rear end so it just loafs along at highway speeds but needs every square inch of those giant rear tires to hook it up in first and second. The boxed chassis is robust and there's a giant Wilwood vented and cross-drilled disc brake at each corner to reel it in on the big end. The front suspension is a Super-Bell dropped I-beam with a slider spring and hairpins, all chrome-plated of course. A Vega steering box provides surprising precision and it does ride pretty well for a high-powered flyweight. Out back, the narrowed Ford 9-inch sits on coil-overs and a 4-link with a modified Panhard rod to keep it centered under the car. Vintage-looking Cragar SS mags are wrapped in brand new Mickey Thompson rubber.", "This car comes with a huge file of build receipts, including dyno sheets and invoices from Pat Musi Racing, documenting the engine build. This car was outrageously expensive to build and was expertly finished by some very talented guys. It has just test and tune miles on it today and is ready to rock. Take it home for less than the cost of parts, never mind the labor to put it all together.
