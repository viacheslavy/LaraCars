See it on Mustang Restorations \"customers' mustangs\" page 3 (Evo's '66 Convertible).  While the engine was apart it received an Edelbrock 4 barrel, manifold, matching cam and dual exhausts.  This increased the performance and reliability without changing the pure stock looks.  Body panels were replaced rather than repaired so there are no extra seam lines.  I believe Doc and his crew lavished more work and expertise on this car than Ford did when it was built, and it shows.  This car has not seen a drop of rain since it was rebuilt.

This 289 V-8 pony car has a 3 speed automatic and a power top.  If you want to enjoy the cooling fall weather this stang will give you the sensation you have been looking for in a vehicle.  With the Mustang Ford set an all-time sales record for first-year of any new model. The Mustang was first presented at the New York Worlds Fair in 1964. Lee Iacocca then head of the Ford Davison felt that a compact sporty model would be just what baby boomers and the public wanted. Ford did have the European Cortina and the Falcon Chevy had the Corvair and Corvette Dodge had the Dart and there were a handful of foreign cars to meet the new demand from the younger generation. But Iacocca thought Ford should produce a compact lightweight bucket seat sports car. And have it priced at less than $2500.  The Mustang was based on the Falcon platform. Originally thought to be two-seater Ford decided to abandon that idea and went with the four passenger layout. Engine choice ranged from a six-cylinder to the 289 cubic-inch placement Ford power plant. It is said that Ford created the Pony Class of American automobiles with the introduction of the Mustang.  Options include: Radio Cassette Power steering Power Top  Vinyl interior.  To view the car in greater detail including 100+ HD photos and HD video please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com.

It gives this coupe a more premium feeling, and you'll see that there have been all the right investments to back this up.  It starts with a professional respray of the factory-correct color.

Plus, all your favorite pieces have plenty of shine like the classic sports steering wheel, heat/defrost controls, and the correct round five-gauge full readout panel.

Ford's trusty 289 V8 looks great with serious signs of keeping it reliable.  The clean presentation showcases the MSD ignition as well as fresh belts, wires, and hoses.  Plus, a Griffin aluminum radiator is always a welcomed upgrade.  But as you marvel at the right reliable components, don't forget to also spot the performance upgrades.  This V8 inhales deeply with a four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority through headers that feed the stainless dual exhaust.  This is the kind of car that wants you to feel the road, and this cruising attitude Is heightened by the three-speed automatic transmission and front disc brakes.  So you'll love driving this classic near or far.", "Complete with owner's manual and a restoration photo book, you are looking at an American icon that is distinctive for being both premium and great to drive.
