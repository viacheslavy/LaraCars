They were popular because they were tough and capable workhorses that served their owners well.  Today, almost 50 years later, they are becoming collectable because of their sharp vintage styling, as well as still being very capable workhorses.  If you can find one in decent shape, they make great trucks at a fraction of the cost of new ones.  Check out this Ranger XLT and see if it finds that sweet spot of classic, capable, and affordable that fits your desires.", "As a Ranger XLT, this truck was dressed up a bit beyond the basics.  The two-tone paint job looks great in Green and Tan.  There is evidence that it was resprayed at some point along the way, and it still looks good even though its showing its age again in a few places.  A sharp looking chrome bumper leads the way with a split grill flanked by single headlights and nice brightwork highlighting everything above it.   Ford appears in script across the front of the hood with a ''Ford 100'' emblem on each side.  Body side moldings running down the side of the truck divide the two-tone with a unique wood tone treatment surrounded by chrome with a bold polished center section.  Ranger XLT appears at the top rear of the bed.  The tailgate also gets the wood treatment in the center panel, and a cover on the bed keeps cargo out of sight and keeps the lines of the truck clean.", "Open the door and you are greeted by an interior dressed out in dark green and with wood and chrome highlights.  The door panel has a large armrest set in a wood toned panel with pleated green upholstery on the bottom.  There is a large comfortable bench with cloth seating surfaces and vinyl surrounds with plenty of room for three people.  The green carpeting is in great shape, and along with the partial headliner, helps to keep things quiet in the cab.  A Grant steering wheel which is a bit smaller than stock has been added, and the shifter for the automatic trans is on the column leaving room for your passenger, (or significant other) to sit in the center without having to straddle a floor shifter.  There is more wood on the unique split dash containing your speedo and basic engine gauges.  Radio with ventilation controls are off to the right, and of course there's a big 'ol glovebox in front of the passenger.", "Pop the hood and you will find a tried and true 351 that's got plenty of power to get the job done.  It is also dressed up a bit with a chrome air topper sitting on a Holley 4bbl carb which handles the fuel mixing duties. Big Edelbrock finned aluminum valve covers look great and help keep the oil cool at the same time.  An MSD 6AL ignition system ensures good reliable spark, and with a recent battery, this baby cranks right up and is eager to go.  The power runs back through a 3-speed automatic transmission and a big power brake booster along with front disc brakes insure that you can get this truck hauled down to a stop whether you are hauling a load, or just hauling down the road.  The rubber meets the road through 15-inch Pirelli Scorpion ATRs mounted on sweet looking chrome wheels.", "Check out this classic, capable, and hard-working truck.
