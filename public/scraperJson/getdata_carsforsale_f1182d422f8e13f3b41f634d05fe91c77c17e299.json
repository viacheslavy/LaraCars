A first-year 1965 Ford Mustang convertible that's such a red-blooded American that it's fully red inside and out.  And because we know you want to drive it, the four-on-the-floor keeps you in complete control of the V8.  Who knew your dream could be this obtainable?  ", "  The red is a factory-correct color, and this great pony shows well in the sun.  Iconic cruisers like this always get the attention, and that's why a bright red Mustang is always in demand.  Plus, the sheetmetal must be clean and straight like it is here, because we all look for the iconic full-length scalloped design.  But more than just a nice shine, this one has added attraction from the details like the correct badging, cool chrome bumpers, and the stylish wire wheel covers.    ", "  While the white vinyl top has the crisp appearance of a recent investment, we like it even better when the roof is down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that's probably why this was order with a power top! The reason why this looks so good open to the world is because the red seats, red carpets, red door panels, and red dash all coordinate so nicely with the exterior.  There's even a red boot cover.  And everyone loves the look of the premium Pony package interior.  But as much as this classic can carry family and friends, it's really the driver who's the most important.  That's why you get that classic three-spoke sports steering wheel with the perfect thin grip.  And your right hand may never want to leave that Hurst shifter.  ", "  Under the hood are some nice upgrades like the Cobra valve covers and the bright air grabber, but there is nothing that gets in the way of the reliable power that comes from Ford's trusty 289 cubic-inch V8.  In fact, this is a true droptop for people who enjoy the feeling of the road.  So you're going to love the total control you get from the four-speed manual transmission, and your favorite soundtrack will be the growl of the dual exhaust as you shift through the optimal powerband.

One replaced the existing wiring harness under dash and replaced it with new one.  Additionally they replaced the small wiring harness that goes to the tail lights, back up lights, and fuel tank.  The head light switch, heater motor, and defroster hoses were also all replaced.  I can always send the work log from the most recent restoration shop. These guys specifically do old mustangs.  There is no rust on the car.    Gordon's Classics in Ga was the shop to work on the car.  The car has been in storage in Marietta, GA the last 4 years.  And has only being taken out to drive it to maintain the existing work.

VW convertibles, MGBs, and Mustangs like this 1965 coupe are all former bargain-basement dwellers that are no longer second-class citizens. Someone has obviously invested big money in this sleek silver hardtop and it includes all the features you'd want from your favorite pony car.  ", "  It's hard to make silver look this good without a lot of time and a lot of money, and that's obviously what happened here. Taking one straight, original car, it was refinished using a lot of hand labor to block the sheetmetal until it was straight enough to calibrate NASA's instruments, then shot with a few coats of the best two-stage urethane you can buy. The gaps are so even and tight that they virtually disappear against the silver body, and it is almost devoid of ornamentation so it looks quite sinister. No modifications mean that it has a classic look, and with GT fog lamps up front and a GT rear valence with exhaust trumpets in back, it's a bit aggressive, too. It's a C-code car, so it came from the factory with a 289, so it's still proudly wearing those emblems on the front fenders. Nice chrome bumpers sparkle against the silvery finish, along with the stainless window surrounds that were polished to a high shine. If you want attention, driving this car will do it.  ", "  You'll find black buckets inside, which were standard equipment on all Mustangs. The Pony seat covers, carpets, and headliner are new and an aftermarket center console was added along the way. It's nice to see that they aimed for an OEM look instead of heavy upgrades, and it works just fine in this coupe. Aftermarket A/C was added under the dash and it blows ice cold thanks to modern hardware working behind the scenes. A woodgrained Cobra steering wheel on a tilt steering column frames a set of custom Auto Meter dials in a gauge panel that closely replicates the original GT instruments. Nice! An AM/FM/iPod radio looks quite correct up high in the dash and the trunk is detailed with a recent reproduction mat.   ", "  No early Mustang is complete without a 289 under the hood, and the snarky small block that powers this pony has a few upgrades that make it a blast on the street. Inside there's an .040 overbore to add a few cubes, along with ARP head bolts, roller rockers, and a custom cam. Up top, there are Edelbrock aluminum heads, a Holley 4-barrel carburetor, and an upgraded ignition system, all buried under a Cobra air cleaner. The engine is painted correct early-1965 black and starts with a great small block bark from the twin mufflers; there's nothing else that sounds like it. A C4 3-speed automatic transmission with a new torque converter is hardly a demerit thanks to quick reflexes and relaxed cruising capabilities and you're certainly not going to hurt the 8-inch rear end by having a little fun on the street.
