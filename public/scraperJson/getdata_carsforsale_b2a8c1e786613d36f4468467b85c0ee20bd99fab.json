fever is in full swing.  Mustangs are flying out of the showroom, and the Camaro was now a player in the pony car market as well.  This was a very exciting time and the buyer was reaping the benefits.    Just Toys Classic Cars is proud to present this beautiful 1967 Ford Mustang GTA.  This is a stunning car that is very highly optioned as well.  There has been a color change to the car.  This car was born bronze, with a black vinyl top.  It is now more Clearwater aqua with a white vinyl top.  The repaint is only a year old and presents very well.  The fit and finish on this car is right on the money.  There are no complaints about this car at all.  This was the car as you rolled down your block people payed attention.  This is not your average Mustang that was ordered stripped down and no options.    So now that we have your attention with how beautiful this car is, let's get in to that deluxe black pony interior and have a look around.  This is exactly how the car was born and this is the original interior.  Everything is in great shape as you will see.  This car is an absolute time capsule.Everything is in great shape and as we said, this car is highly optioned.  This car was born with power steering, power brakes, and A/C.  We have the Marti Report to document all of this.    Okay, so you are comfortable in the seat, and you are now ready to go and have some fun.  So you reach out and give the gas a pump or two, and you reach forward and hit that key.  The sweet sound of that 390 with 320 HP fills your ears, and you now have an ear to ear grin on your face that is hard to get rid of.  1967 was the first year for the 390 in the Mustang and it was not a cheap option.  It was over 270.00 for the option when the national average weekly pay in 1967 was only $160.  This would have been a very expensive Mustang for the day and it has survived well over the years.  Now, throw that C6 in to drive and get ready to rock and roll.  This is going to be one of the most fun classic cars you will have ever driven.  You have plenty of horsepower, and you have all of the options that people are used to on modern cars of today.  You will get a great thumb work out every time you take this car out from all the thumbs up you have to give.    We offer classic car financing for those of you that would like to take advantage of the option.  They offer great rates and terms and allow you to pay your baby off when you want to.  We look forward to speaking with you soon, and we look forward to making you the newest member of the Just Toys Classic Cars family.   DISCLAIMER:    Before you buy any vehicle, sight unseen,  it is very important to ask as many questions as possible to make sure you are getting what you expect.  The majority of the customers that buy vehicles from us are very happy with their purchases.

But beyond its attention grabbing-presence, this 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 302 tribute gets all the detail right with the striping, iconic Mag wheels, highly detailed V8, high-quality A/C interior, and so much more.  ", "  You're looking at a 1970 official Ford color called Grabber Blue that was named after the way it grabs your attention.  This factory-correct hue looks fantastic today thanks to a solid investment in a more recent professional application.  This kind of modern paint gives you exceptionally better  quality than the day this car left the factory.  The result is a sleek fastback pony the kind of luster in the sunshine that Ford never could have dreamed of back in the day.  And speaking of upgrades, the full Boss 302 stripe package is always a crowd pleaser.  The deep black package here combines with the hood scoop, hood stripe, chin spoiler, louvered rear window, and big spoiler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it all creates a bright blue Mustang that isn't afraid to show its sinister side!  Yes, this is intimidation on wheels.  ", "  Just like the exterior, the interior was restored to make this one a better muscle car for the ages. There's no better inside color on a car like this than black, especially with the high-back buckets. All the right stock pieces appear in place, from the floor-mounted to the heat/defrost controls.  The driver gets a dual spoke steering wheel that gives you a commanding view of the full gauge package.  This one has a time machine-like appeal right down to its factory AM radio (for display).  But as period-correct as this one appears, you'll be quite happy when you feel the upgrade to R134a air conditioning.  ", "  As much as the restoration produced a fantastic interior and exterior, it's what's under the hood that you'll love the most.  This 302 cubic-inch V8 perfectly blends factory original appearance with plenty of upgrades. You see it in the way the bright air topper and all the correct decals so nicely coordinate with the modern Ford Racing valve covers.  But the true reason for this engine bay's appeal is the cleanliness that tells you maintenance and care were a priority.  Out on the open road, the four-barrel carburetor unleashes all the right power, and the dual exhaust gives that kind of growl that makes you believe this pony is really a tiger.  Plus, with features like a three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, front disc brakes, and BF Goodrich tires on iconic Mag wheels, you have a great all-around Boss tribute that is easy to drive and show off anywhere.  ", "  So now you really see the full picture on this one.  It's time to be the shining Boss without paying the higher price.
