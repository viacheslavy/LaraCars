This car spent nearly its entire life in Texas being built in San Jose and first sold by Miracle Ford, Northwest Lovers Lane in Dallas to a young lady.  Years later in the '90's it went to Florda where it received an engine and transmission rebuild, new pony upholstery and the one and only repaint keeping it the original springtime yellow.paint color.  It has never had any rust, no acccidents and it still has all of its original sheet metal body and floor.  Up to that point every service done on the car was recorded including any service parts that went on the car.  Some time after 2000 it got sold to a sophisticated Ford collector in Chesterland, Ohio where it stayed in the family after his death.  It was never driven during inclement weather.  Most recently it got a new black top, one of only three original colors offered, white, black or blue.

It's a true A-code car that believed to be a true GT.  That gives it a real distinction, and when combined with the four-speed manual transmission, some great speedy moves, too.  Plus, that's not even the rarest part of the iconic coupe.", "Red Mustangs always instantly attract an audience, and this one does it one better with a hint of sinister sports car attitude courtesy of the GT package elements.  After all, the white triple stripe on the rocker panels that sit between the 14-inch styled steel wheel and redline tires give this one a profile that's more aggressive than most of the other '66s you'll come across.  But we all know there are some GT-specific elements you need to get right, and this one has it all.  Fog lights in the grille, all the correct badging, and dual trumpet exhaust pipes coming through the rear valence.  Overall fit and finish is very good, making it the kind of car you want to drive around and show off. The paint is more recent, so the red is particularly alluring; the chrome is bright; the stainless has been polished; the weather stripping feels fresh; and all the little trim pieces are in place, right down to the proper GT badges on the fenders and gas cap.", "A pristine black interior is always the perfect complement to a bright red exterior.  Everything from the seats, to the door panels, to the carpeting carries the kind of quality that tells you this has always been under good care.  Plus, this one has some nice premium touches like the wood rim in the three-spoke steering wheel and R134a air conditioning. But beyond just comfort features, there's a very unique element to this interior.  Mustang people instantly recognize that bench seat with folding center armrest.  It makes this a rare classic with around 3.5% of total '66 production had this feature in coupes.  A more informative five-dial gauge panel became standard in 1966, but few also have this coupe's Rally Pac large tach and clock that enthusiasts really look for today. It's part of a more performance-oriented interior that you'll instantly feel the moment you grab the gearstick.", "Under the hood are more signs of great care.  This 289 cubic-inch V8 looks great with the shiny elements like the air cleaner and valve covers.  But beyond just the attention-grabbing components that impress at car shows, this motor has real performance substance.  This is originally an A-code car, and so it should be no surprise that there is a four-barrel carburetor on this V8.  The motor up easily, and it exhales with a true presence through a newer dual exhaust with performance H-pipe construction.  And you have full control over this V8 and its rumbling soundtrack thanks to the four-speed manual transmission.  Plus, the power steering and front disc brakes makes this a standout Mustang that's easy to drive anywhere.", "Rarely do you find an iconic classic that has rarity and desirability, and yet is still quite obtainable.
