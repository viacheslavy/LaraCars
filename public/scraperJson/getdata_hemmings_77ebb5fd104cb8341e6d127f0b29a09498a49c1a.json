With a powerful 289 and an appealing color scheme, this is a fun and fast summertime cruiser that will serve you well for years to come.", "Paint and bodywork have been freshened within the last year, and the formal gloss black paint this car current wears compliments the coupe body style extremely well. Done in two-stage urethane, it does nothing to diminish those timeless Mustang shape, making it look like it should cost a lot more than it does. The paint is much better than the original enamel, and while it's not perfect, it's extremely attractive and could be taken up a notch with a proper buff after the repaint. You can easily spot a '68 Mustang with its side marker lights, and few enthusiasts will argue that 1968 wasn't a high point for Ford stylists. Chrome is bright, the stainless has been polished, and all the Mustang badges have been properly placed following the repaint. Add in the unusual black vinyl roof, something you don't see all that often on a '68, and you get a car that's both sporting and elegant, perfect for the Mustang's personality.", "Inside, a correct black vinyl bucket seat interior shows you why the Mustang was a perennial best-seller. Comfortable, stylish, and nicely finished, it's the perfect complement to the gorgeous exterior. Most certainly a combination of nice original pieces and quality replacements, it gives you a good idea of how well preserved this car was, and how carefully the restorer worked to blend the two seamlessly. The seat covers show no signs of age and no splits or tears, and with a center console this car has a very upscale feel inside. The fat three-spoke steering wheel obviously isn't original, but the bright gauges are and still work properly. The original AM radio has been replaced by a more recent AM/FM unit that fits into the original slot, so no cutting and it can be returned to original condition easily. Underneath, the ''garage door'' storage compartment is nicely preserved and undamaged, as so often happens on these cars. The trunk features a correct mat and a full-sized spare with jack assembly so it's ready for a road trip.", "We have every reason to believe that's the original C-code 289 cubic inch V8 under the hood, but with Fords it's always tough to know for certain. However, it looks every bit like the original powerplant, wearing Ford Blue paint, finned valve covers, and a matching open-element air cleaner supplies the fresh air. Edelbrock supplied the carburetor, which is a 4-barrel upgrade from the original 2-barrel, and there's a mild cam inside so it's a bit more powerful than you'd expect. A set of long-tube headers feed a dual exhaust system that delivers a performance sound without being too loud, both at full throttle and more importantly, at cruising speeds. One look at the chassis and you'll know that this has always been a clean, dry car. The 3-speed automatic drives a rugged 8-inch rear with easy-cruising 2.79 gears, and with power steering, it's just effortless. New shocks, a fresh gas tank, and those cool 17-inch wheels and 225/45/17 performance radials make it ready to rumble.", "With great performance, a killer engine note, and gorgeous, instantly-recognizable good looks, this '68 coupe puts you behind the wheel of a legend for not a lot of cash. Grab a friend or two and hit the road, that's what the Mustang is all about. Call today!"], "Exterior:": "Black", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "18700"}},

Obviously bitten by the same bug as Luc, Elliot built his own '66 Mustang coupe alongside the '69, and the duo would go on to test and race them together for 7 years.  They became regulars at Laguna Seca, Sears Point, Thunderhill, and ButtonWillow in Trans AM, Vintage, and ARC events.", "Elliot recently shared a particular and excite event by phone (some paraphrasing for context) ....", "Luc and I arrived at Laguna Seca for a scheduled open track day to further dial in the cars.  We were stopped at the gate and told that the track was rented for the day by the California Porsche and BMW racing clubs. Less than happy with that news, we were then kindly invited by the clubs to run with them, and firmly implied we stay out of their way.", "Well, for the full day, those 2 old Mustangs piled up continuous emphatic passes, as well some bruised ''German'' egos, yet all in good sport.  One by one, they would casually approach our cars in the pits, then quickly drop to see our ''trick race chassis''.  All got up quickly, comically scratching their heads at the stock Ford frames. We left with new friends, but ones never wanting to see our backsides again.", "A vintage SCCA racing competitor also made note of Luc's '69 convertible ....", "Luc used to own this car, and I had the distinct displeasure of having my doors blown off at Laguna Seca in one of the SCCA vintage races ;-) and I am not slow around that track! The car handles amazing and it is a rocket.", "Back to the build.  It is told the Mustang Corral transformation was done at a cost of nearly $100k, and a big chunk of that in her heart.

Not only did this first generation of Mustangs enjoy outstanding commercial success, their very popularity was so extreme that it literally inspired an entirely new class of automobile - the pony car. With its vibrant exterior, tasteful modifications and powerful, upgraded drivetrain, this 1966 Mustang will be a great acquisition for the classic car enthusiast who is looking for some of that pony car magic to put in their garage.", "By the time this 1966 came out, Ford realized they were onto something special and wisely chose to leave the Mustang's original design of one model year earlier almost completely intact. Upon first look, it's pretty easy to see what fueled all that consumer enthusiasm more than 50 years ago. Its relatively long hood and short deck lid clearly branded it as a muscle car, but while the public had certainly seen muscle cars introduced before it, none looked quite like this. Clad in its vibrant, original candy apple red paint, it's simply a great looking car relatively compact, yet by no means cramped; miles from the relatively square shape of its larger brethren, yet very capable looking. The addition of a tasteful, low profile hood scoop and a pair of GT-style fog lights on its front grille add a ''premium'' look to its aesthetics, and its bright exterior is complemented by clean chrome trim and badging, straight and level front and rear bumpers, as well as nice, clear glass.", "Inside, the original black vinyl has been replaced with Ford's palomino shade on the seating and deluxe door panels, and it's an effective choice, providing a nice contrast to the black dash and carpeting. Both the low-backed buckets up front and the bench seat in back have plenty of life left in them and show no obvious tears or marked discoloration. Considering that first generation Mustangs are by no means expansive cars, there's a surprising amount of legroom in back, so your passengers that prove slow on the draw to call ''shotgun'' will still be accommodated comfortably. The dash has been left in stock configuration, but an assortment of white-faced Equus gauges now sit in place of their original counterpart in the instrument cluster, and an aftermarket tach has been mounted on the steering column to monitor revs during more enthusiastic driving.  A full-sized spare sits in the trunk area, covered with signature Ford plaid to match the floor lining.", "Raise the scooped hood and you'll find a 351 Windsor sitting in place of the original 289 small block. Carrying an Edelbrock intake manifold with a 4-barrel on top, it's a far more powerful engine than the one this Mustang started out with, and it fires right up and sounds great as it exhales out the dual exhaust. Another great upgrade is the 5-speed manual transmission that replaces the original 3-speed automatic, as it offers both a more involving driving experience and an overdrive gear to keep RPMs nice and low during highway driving. This vintage Ford classic sits on a set of 14'' Magnum 500 wheels, outfitted with Cooper Cobra radials.", "If you're looking for a classic Mustang that combines great looks with an updated, powerful drivetrain that makes it a blast to drive, you have to check out this 1966 Ford Mustang.
