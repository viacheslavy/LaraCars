This is a nice driver quality car that came to us out of Missouri and as you can see from the trophies in the picture and video it's been a consistent show winner.  It's a little older restoration that is still in quite nice shape.  The bright red paint still has a great luster and nice deep shine to it.  You can also see the interior is in nice shape and is free of any major rips or tears.  This convertible has a power top that works well and  will keep the elements out if you happen to get caught in any inclement weather.  As you can hear in the video the 396 runs strong and sounds great through the headers and flowmaster exhaust.  The engine is paired to an automatic transmission and 12 bolt rear differential..  This Chevy is also equipped with power brakes and power steering.  It did come to us from the south and the heater core was bypassed/removed as well as the wiper motor.  You can take a look at the underside pics and see there was some work done on the floor pans during the restoration.  The car has recently had new bushings in the front,  as well as rear shocks and other suspension components.   All in all this car is a nice driver quality car that you can take to cruise ins, car shows, or just out for ice cream on a warm summer night.

We were also told, that while Richard was performing donuts in his parking lot, he accidentally hit a concrete bollard! I guess Richard didn't understand that this car was made to turn left not right!", "Country & western singer and human teddy bear Kenny Rogers made his film debut in this story about a stock car racer and six orphans. Brewster Baker (Rogers), a loner who's been away from racing for a few years, one day discovers six kids trying to strip his car. No Brady Bunch, this brood has taken to stealing car parts for money, but Brewster still takes a liking to them, putting their mechanical expertise to work in his big comeback bid and teaching them to behave in the bargain. For all its cute contrivances, SIX PACK isn't a bad film and is guaranteed to warm the hearts of Rogers' fans. Among the kids, future stars Diane Lane (THE COTTON CLUB) and Anthony Michael Hall (SIXTEEN CANDLES) show their promise.", "The movie was designed to suck you in with a cool race car, and tug on your heart strings with a happy ending. While the racing in Six Pack wasn't NASCAR's Winston Cup series (now Sprint Cup), but rather its Grand National series; it was still one of the first major films to feature stock car racing. NASCAR legends such as Darrell Waltrip, Mark Martin, Alan Kulwicki and Rusty Wallace made cameo appearances in the movie.", "So where has this Sixpack Stock Car been for the past three decades? Well as of  lately, the full history has been a little cloudy and we have discovered during our recent research that there is a bit of myth and legend surrounding these original Sixpack cars. The real story is Kenny Rogers and K.C. Spurlock together owned and formed Gambler Racing Chassis located in Hendersonville Tennessee. Gambler was set up to produce the five cars that were going to be used for the up and coming Six Pack movie starring Kenny himself.  One of the cars purchased was originally built in Parchment Michigan with a Howe chassis by racer John Dole and raced at Galesburg speedway, John took the proceeds from selling his race car and bought a new car that got to do a small appearance in the movie as car 16. The second movie car that was for the asphalt track filming was built by Jr. Hanley (\u201cMr.Canada\u201d) at his shop in Canada. The third car was purchased from Roscoe Smith (Howe chassis) and the fourth car was from Bopp Chassis Machine. The fifth car, which is the only original car remaining today and the car presented for sale was built from an original Green Hornet Howe 3 race chassis.", "This car was the \u201ccamera car\u201d and was attached to a camera vehicle rig (rig was designed by stock car driver Don Schisler and could do speeds up to 120mph!) and was used for all the head on shots of Kenny Rogers racing around the tracks. After all the racing track shots were completed the car was then welded to the RV's racing trailer to complete all of the RV scenes in the movie. This is 100% that car and we have all the history and documentation to prove as such.", "In 1982 after the filming of the movie, one car was destroyed in a race at Seven Flags speedway in Douglassville, GA and the other three cars that were damaged during filming were parted out and sold. The last car, which is this car was taken back to Gambler Racing Chassis along with the trailer and the RV. Unfortunately the stock car and RV were left at the shop neglected for many years until the mid 90's when a struck of luck changed the future fate of the only remaining Brewster Baker car!", "The hero in this story that literally saved a generation's movie car was \u201cOld School\u201d sprint car legend Larry Wood of New Weston Ohio. Larry was and still is a mechanic and crew chief, but most notably, an owner and builder. This \u201cOld School\u201d guy does it pretty much on his own with hard work, a mind that that can analyze any problem, unbelievable fabrication skills, and most importantly, a great love of the sport. While back in the day Larry Wood was one of many just like him, today the Larry Woods of the world are quickly disappearing from the racing landscape.", "In 1996 while Larry was doing some research for building a replica sprint car for his dear friend Brad Doty who raced a Gambler sprint car in the 1980's. Larry called his friend C.K. Spurlock and Tommy Sanders of Gambler in search for period correct parts. During the conversation Larry curiously asked them what ever happened to the original Brewster Baker cars? C.K. replied \u201cHeck, the remaining Six Pack car is sitting out back of our plant here in Hendersonville since 1982. If you want it, come down and get it! Otherwise its going to scrap!\u201d The offer didn't have to be repeated and Larry was quickly on his way to Tennessee to haul back the authentic Brewster car for a complete but unexpected restoration! When Larry arrived the Brewster car was still on its original racing trailer from the movie, actually it was still welded to the trailer from its last filming scenes. The RV was also still on location but was in poor shape and sold off to someone else. Unfortunately the trailer was also in very poor shape and had to be cut to safely remove the Brewster car without damaging it. The current state of the Brewster car was in decent shape, the original body by Stock Car Fiberglass was in pretty good condition and the car still had a lot of originality still intact except for most of the engine was gone except for the block. Original parts that still remained from the movie were the original Frankland quick change rear end, original Howe hubs, Howe spindles, Howe coils, steering, Neal pedals and amazingly the original Stewart-Warner gauges and the famous custom made shifter that you can see in the movie!", "Once back in Ohio with the car, restoration began first with the engine. Wood created a new powerplant that was consistent with early-1980s vintage of this car. He installed a small block 30 over 350ci with Speed-Pro forged pistons, Air Flow Research heads, Reed flat tappet cam, Holley double pumper carb and Accel Ignition. For a transmission he chose a 2-speed powerglide automatic transmission with a 2800 stall converter so he could easily drive the car around at parades and racing events. One of the finishing touches to the engine was a set of Rayburn valve covers that are a 1 of 1 prototype personally given to Larry from CJ Rayburn. The deal for the valve covers was only if Larry promised to place them on the last and remaining Brewster car! Another final touch was Larry wanted to find the correct tires for the original wheels that were still on the car. Larry called his contact at Goodyear tires and they said the tires were discontinued years ago and not available. A month later a fresh set of Goodyear Short Track tires showed up at Larry's door. Larry called Goodyear back and asked how much do I owe you guys for finding these tires? They replied back nothing as we want donate these tires to the Brewster Baker restoration and they are literally the last set as we found them in the back of our New Jersey warehouse!", "Over the years Larry accomplished majority of the magnificent restoration himself but wanted to credit the painting and final detailing to Lloyd Trump of New Madison, Ohio. The correct colors were perfectly matched from the original by Larry Wagner of Dayton, Ohio. Larry was generous to give us plenty of photos of the car before, during and after the restoration and after viewing these photos we have to admit that fate led Larry to restore this special car because there might not be anyone alive that could have done it any better or more correct!", "After restoration was complete Larry had the Brewster car in his possession for about ten years before selling it to a local friend who later down the road traded the car to someone else. Then it just so happened that the Brewster car ended up being the featured car at the Celebrity Car Show taking place at Gas Monkey Live in November of 2016. Richard Rawlings and Dennis Collins both remembered the movie and decided to make an offer. The deal happened rather quickly as the owner threw out a number that worked and Richard and Dennis were willing to pay cash that day to make it happen. The flatbed was there within the hour and Richard, Dennis and the owner went back to Gas Monkey Garage where they finalized the deal.", "In April of 2017 we purchased the Brewster car from Richard Rawlings and brought it back to our facility in St. Louis. We were told most likely that the car could be just a replica but we had a couple of leads and clues that the car was authentic. After some time researching and being welcomed with huge hospitality of the dirt racing community we were able to put together an amazing but authentic history of this Kenny Rogers movie car! We would like to thank the Gundaker family at Tri-City Speedway in Granite City for letting us play on their wonderful dirt track with the Brewster car and featuring is at the UMP Hell Tour Nationals! Thank you Larry and Bear Wood for helping us putting together the lost but critical history of the car and writer Bill Holder for documenting the restoration and car movie history. Thank you Richard Rawlings and the crew at Gas Monkey Garage for selling us the car and another big thank you to Larry Wood for saving the last original SixPack movie stock car! Love will turn you around!", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. It is sold as is on a bill of sale, where is, without a title. This car is an authentic race car and is not street legal.", "GET OUT AND RACE!!!"], "Exterior:": "White/Blue", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto"}},

This is a very special Z28 and anyone that is serious on investing in a correct 1969 Z28 really needs to pay close attention to this car.", "In the past 3 decades we have purchased over 8,000 cars from all over the world but we have to admit that the best cars always come from our local back yard and the story on this particular Z28 is a perfect example. This was an early 1969 Z28 and was built over the last week of October 1968 and completed in the first week of November 1968 at the Norwood Ohio plant. The Z28 was shipped and sold new in Denver Colorado and the new owner brought the car here to St. Louis in the early 70's. In 1980 the car was sold to Mr. Brune in New Haven Missouri and for the next 37 years the Z28 had shared ownership among 3 good friends who were all serious first generation Z28 enthusiasts. In 1995 after 15 years of ownership Mr. Brune sold the Z28 to his friend Mr. Pisane in the neighboring town of Union Missouri. Mr. Pisane fully restored the Z28 over his course of ownership and his restoration quality was top notch and is the reason why this car still stands up today!", "In 2011 Mr. Pisane sold the Z28 to his friend Mr. Branson and the car ended up back in New Haven Missouri. At this time, the market for correct and number matching Z28's were really starting to sky rocket in value. This posed a dilemma for Mr. Branson who really wanted to enjoy driving his newly acquired Z28 but didn't want to diminish the value. His solution was to pull the numbers matching DZ block and found another correct 1969 DZ block and sent it to Martin Engine and Machine in Vandalia Missouri to have it built for a performance street build.  The original motor was pulled by Martin and confirmed as still good and functional as you can see on the original receipt photographed in the photo gallery. The original numbers matching block is included with the purchase of the car.", "For the cost of $5,347.00 Martin Engine fully rebuilt the new donor 1969 DZ block into a 500+ HP high RPM monster 302 engine. They upgraded the pistons to Speed-Pro Hypereutectic 11.1 pistons .030 over, high performance rods, blue print and balanced, Comp Cam 12-422-8 and many other high perforamnce upgrades. They transferred over the correct 3927186 64cc heads and \u201csnowflake\u201d aluminum high rise intake from the original number matching motor. The kept the original numbers matching M21 4 speed transmission (P9R23B) and the matching Eaton Positraction 3.73:1 rear axel  (BU 1024G1) all intact. Mr. Branson kept all the original parts they did not use in the new build such as original smog equipment and carb which is all still included.", "As this Z28 stands today the next owner has a couple of fun options. You can actually drive and enjoy this this correct Z28 and the current sinister asphalt pounding performance of the built 302. Or you can take the original numbers matching DZ block and the rest of the holy grail 1969 Z28 parts that are included and finish this Z28 out to a very high investment level Z28 with all the impossible to find date code parts and history of this particular Camaro. The parts included with this Z28: date code correct smog pump, pulley 3927116 AU and both smog exhaust manifolds 3942527, original Hurst shifter and ball 8D410, original brake calipers, original carb 4053 3923289-DZ, original alternator 1100837, original distributor 1111443,  original radiator 3010178 and the original date code correct dual horns. Included with its original 1969 Camaro owners manual, years of Missouri registration cards, copies of all titles dating back to 1980, full build sheet and receipt from the perforamnce DZ 302 build from Martin Engine and Machine and numerous other receipts and notes.", "Dressed in its factory correct Fathom Green Metallic with white racing stripes, the paint and trim are in almost excellent overall condition. The glass panels are clear and crack-free and the lights are intact and haze-free. This car rides on correct 15\u2033 rally wheels with brand new tires. All of the Camaro's body panels are straight and solid, including the rear wing and special duct hood. The engine bay is quite tidy; the bumpers are in excellent shape and the battery looks new. A lot of the outside trim pieces appear to be original and not re-pops like many other restored Z28's. Even down to a nice matching set of T3 headlights and date code correct tail light lenses. The previous owner even mentioned to us that it took him over five years to find the next to impossible original Missouri 1969 license plate that reads \u201cAA1-669\u201d. Not only does it have \u201c69\u201d in the tag but by coincidence its the only year the state of Missouri ever used dark green lettering. It just so happens to perfectly match this long time green Z28 resident of Missouri!", "Under that duct hood with the white racing stripes is a high revving professionally built 500+ HP 302 CID Turbofire V-8 engine, buttoned to its original close-ratio Hurst four-speed manual transmission and its original 12-bolt rear with a 3.73 posi final drive. Driver assist features include power steering and power brakes with front discs, date code correct brake cylinder 309 and booster 9204. The original numbers matching DZ block is included with the purchase of this car.", "Inside, the factory correct Ivory vinyl bucket seats look very good and are in nice contrast to the black carpeting, which is in good order. The black headliner and instrument panel, plus three-spoke steering wheel and inner door panels are all in very good condition. The mirror glass looks good and the center console, with its woodgrain accents, is in very good order, as is the Hurst shifter. The rear courtesy lights still work. There are ancillary gauges set ahead of the shifter on the console. Completing the interior is a factory GM AM/FM radio.", "Underneath of this Z28 is extremely tidy and exactly what you want to find! The pans looks excellent and the car has been fitted with new and correct to early 1969 Z28's non chambered dual exhaust. This Z28 sounds amazing and screams like the devil past 4,000 RPM's, the overall performance is down right stunning!", "When the Z28 emerged on the scene in 1967, it's job was to take away some of the Trans Am victories Ford Mustangs, Shelbys, Dodge Darts and Plymouth Barracudas had been enjoying. The Z28 was remarkable in many ways\u2014the engine was the result of engineering a 327 block with a 283 crankshaft and then using an arsenal of performance elements to create a remarkable performance engine. The chassis and suspension were addressed for balance and stability, which trickled down to the wheels, tires and brakes as well. Literally nothing was left to chance with Z28, and most of the action was available from the showroom floor. It turned the performance-car industry on its side and gave the other manufacturers something to think about. Today, the Z28 is one of the most sought-after collector cars on the market. A hybrid muscle-and-sports car, the Z28 has enough power to run quarter-mile passes all day long, but it's truly happiest running anywhere a lot of turns and curves are to be had. The chassis allows it to easily slice through twisties, while the powerful, quick-revving engine and normally lower gearing helps it slow into the turn and shoot out of it like lightning. This Z28 is a remarkably exciting car and its pedigree makes this car a serious investment level 1969 Z28, definitely not one to miss out on as we know we will never find another like this one.", "Competition to this Camaro in 1969 included AMC's AMX, AMC's Javelin, the Avanti II, Dodge's Dart, Ford's Mustang Boss 302, Mercury's Cougar, Plymouth's Barracuda and Pontiac's Firebird Trans Am.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

MotoeXotica Classic Cars is pleased to present this 1964 Chevrolet C-20 \u00be-Ton Flatbed Dualie that has been lovingly cared for by the same owner since 1986, 31 years! This mostly original example was assembled at GM's St. Louis, Missouri factory (as indicated by the S in the VIN below). It has been stored indoors for more than three decades! We are selling this truck for a local enthusiast as it is time to move on to the next stewart.

The truck's windows are clear and intact while its lights are haze-free and clear. This truck rolls on 6.50-16 LT tires in front and four Dunlop 6.50-16 snow tires in the rear, however the tires show signs of wear. The tires surround black steel wheels.", "The truck's bodywork is straight and its flatbed, with its new oaken floor, is ready for stakes to be added or to use as a flatbed only. There is a new front bumper, the truck's engine bay is tidy but not highly detailed and the battery in decent order. Rear trailer hitch is also included.", "Under the hood is a 230 CID straight six-cylinder engine, buttoned to a four-speed manual transmission. This unit was definitely ordered as a work truck; it has no power steering, the four-wheel drum brakes are non-assisted and it has no air-conditioning.", "Inside, the tan bench seat looks excellent. A new, black floor mat replaces any carpeting and are in good condition. The metal headliner is in decent order while the tan instrument panel presents well. There are ancillary amperage and oil pressure gauges mounted below the instrument panel. The original two-spoke steering wheel is present in and in good condition. The inner door panels reflect this truck's work orientation and are in good condition, as is the mirror glass and shift lever. Rounding out the interior is an AM/FM stereo with cassette deck and a speaker in each inner door panel.", "The most significant improvement for 1964 was the change from the dogleg windshield to the conventional curved type. It provided easier entrance and exits for driver and passengers and looked much better, too. The 230 and 292 CID six cylinder engines continued as the standard engines for all two-wheel drive models.", "Competition to this C-20 in 1964 included Dodge's D-200 series truck, Ford's F-250 truck and GMC's 1500-series truck.", "This truck is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

The previous boxier body style was abandoned for the sleeker fastback look to move forward into the next,  more hip, generation of the American automobile. The long lines gave it a lower leaner look while still keeping enough room inside for the passengers.  The SS trim was still the ''performance'' version with the higher horse power V8s, stiffer suspension, bigger brakes, and upsacle interiors.  This individual is an true 166 code SS that spent most of it's life in Texas and was nicely equipped with the SS package, a 4 speed, power steering, and rare air conditioning. Finished in Regal Red with black bucket seat interior with console it looks fabulous. Enhancing the visual horse power are the polished American Racing Torque Thrust wheels with 16 inch Yokohoma radials. This one has had the benefit of the ac being upgraded with new Vintage heat and air and front power disc brakes that are drilled and ventilated.  The paint is very nice and the chrome and stainless are nearly new, there are some minor scratches on the rear bumper.
