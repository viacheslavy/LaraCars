The 3000 series cars were so significant  that this series comprised more than sixty percent of the total production volume worldwide at their peak of manufacturing. These capable six cylinder brutes would quickly become known affectionately as the 'Big Healey'. Not only was the car popular  the affordability allowed for market expansion particularly in North America  which accounted for nearly 90% of all sales.

The ownership history and records date back to the early 1970s in Northern California. The car was owned by a resident of Fremont  CA from 1973 \u2013 1979  and then sold to \u201cConcourse Car Center\u201d in Hayward  CA. Shortly thereafter  the car was acquired by Oakland British Motors of Oakland  CA  who prepared a detailed service record from 1979 replacing the clutch  new rotor  points  plugs  thermostat  and various hoses  likely in preparation for sale. At that time  the car had 89 964 miles when it was sold to the current owner on November 20  1979. In 1980  the current owner had the engine rebuilt. During his near 40 year ownership  the car was garaged at the current owners Oakland  CA home where it accumulated an additional 25 000 miles  reflected in the 12 438 miles currently showing on the car. In recent years marque expert Jim Groom has performed maintenance and general service on the car as needed.", "Cosmetically  the car presents in good driver condition with older black paint over what appears to be a largely original and solid body. The current owner indicates that there were never any accidents during his ownership  however the passenger rear corner appears to have had minor body repair at some point prior to 1979. Further inspection reveals that the car was at one time previously painted red  likely the original color. The body panels are generally nice with no major issues noted. The doors have slight looseness in closure  but the hood and trunk are solid and fit well. The chrome is in good shape  with light pitting and some surface scratches on a few pieces. The bumpers and grill present nicely  with nice contrast against the black paint. The glass and lighting are in good condition  with minor road wear to the front windscreen.", "The interior is a tidy combination of enjoyably used materials befitting the years of ownership. The upholstery itself is in good shape  particularly the seats  which have been recently recovered in high quality black vinyl. The carpeting is tidy and serviceable  while the dashboard  steering wheel  and instruments appear original and visually quite nice. There are no major deviations from stock inside or outside  in keeping with the preservation and leisurely use that has been the guiding theme over the past four decades.", "The engine compartment is attractive and tidy  having been properly finished with attention to originality and finishes  with a few minor deviations toward modern motoring. The engine compartment certainly shows signs of use  but remains quite attractive and in keeping with the generally sound exterior presentation. The firewall and inner fenders show no immediately visible signs of damage or repair. The interior of the trunk was recently fitted with new correct upholstery.", "The car starts easily and settles into solid idle. The gearshift lever has a bit of play  but gears are easily engaged and the clutch works smoothly without a great deal of pedal pressure. Brakes are essentially consistent with expectations of the period  and the lightness of the car makes steering rather easy even at slower speeds. The car tracks well on the road  with good manners exhibiting generally predictable sounds one might encounter from a tidy but capable car of this era. The car comes with various manuals  assorted copies of older editions of \u201cHealey Highlights\u201d  a black soft top  a roll bar  a black tonneau cover  side curtains with window frames  a set of fog lamps  rear seat cover stays  jack  and a pair of new Austin Healey fender covers.", "This is a great opportunity to acquire an attractive big Healey that has been enjoyed and maintained by a thoughtful long-term enthusiast.

JVS 302 was built at the Warwick factory on 29th and 30th November 1960 and dispatched to the USA on 23rd January 1961. The British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certificate states that this Austin-Healey was dispatched in lefthand drive format with wire wheels, overdrive, heater, adjustable steering column, laminated windscreen, road speed tyres and finished in Healey Ice Blue with blue matching trim and hood. Little history of the car is known prior to 1976 but from this time until 1989 it resided with various owners in California. During this period the engine underwent a rebuild. In October 1989, the car was imported into the UK from California by Innes Ireland, the well-known and talented racing driver from 1950's. A year later, the current owner spotted the car advertised in a local newspaper in Berkshire. Our owner states, \"I had no intentions of buying a big Healey but was interested in seeing it considering it was only five miles away and anyway, I was happy with my Frogeye at the time. When the Healey's big straight six was started, I fell in love with it, it sounded gorgeous and I was determined that it was going to be mine. I left a deposit and asked a car restorer to check the car over and he gave it the thumbs up. The car was tired looking but running and totally complete with its original panel work.\"\u009dA total, documented/photographic, restoration began in 1990 whereby it was discovered that the Healey had not suffered structurally, the chassis and all body panels being original and the only repairs required being to the outer sills and no more than two inches of the bottom front area of the rear wing sections. All the original components were kept with no replacement parts but unfortunately, due to having been laid up and open to the elements in the Californian sunshine, all of the trim leather required replacement. Everything was refurbished and during this time, the Healey was converted to righthand drive. The restoration was completed in 1992 and since has been lovingly maintained and kept in dry storage and only used sparingly on dry days, along with the other examples of the vendor's private collection. The result of the restoration was stunning resulting in several concours awards being achieved. The Healey has been constantly well maintained by the leading Austin-Healey specialists and today, this matching numbers Healey still looks as fresh as the day the restoration was completed, a tribute to the standard of that restoration and a credit to the owner for maintaining that standard over 27 years. Supplied with the car is a comprehensive history file and includes the UK V5 registration document, the afore mentioned British Motor Industry Heritage Trust Certificate, log books including USA bills, receipts and an original Austin-Healey 3000 Driver's Handbook signed by Margaret Healey.The Austin-Healey 3000 has endeared itself to enthusiasts worldwide, not least for those who remember the sight and sound of this muscular British sports car roaring to spectacular success in international rallying; with this, the quality of the restoration, the calibre of the former owners and the condition this Austin-Healey is presented in, it would be difficult to find a finer example anywhere today.", "Auction"], "Mileage:": "99394"}},
