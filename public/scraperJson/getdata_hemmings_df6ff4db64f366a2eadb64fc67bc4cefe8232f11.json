The bodywork on this 1949 Chevy 3100 pickup looks like it's been working the back 40 for decades, but the slammed stance, updated running gear, and custom interior all suggest that it's been working out in its spare time.", "The bodywork is original, which is to say, it hasn't been treated to a shiny coat of paint. The combination of green paint, chips and scratches, and bare steel gives it a look of great age, and if this one was out in a field with the weeds growing around it, it wouldn't look out of place. But that isn't to say that it looks bad, because we like the honest look and the faded graphics add to the well-worn, well-loved attitude. Looking closely, you'll see that the paint hides nothing, but the panel gaps are good, meaning someone spent some time intentionally making it look this way, and nothing has been shaved, trimmed, or altered. Instead, you get a look that will draw a crowd better than any restoration and a no worries finish that means this truck can go anywhere, any time without a second thought. Yeah, maybe the chrome is a bit too nice, but one can hardly call that a defect, right? There's also a real pickup bed out back, albeit with a cleverly raised floor to clear the suspension (more on that in a few minutes) and a beer keg strapped in to act as a fuel tank. They definitely nailed the look.", "The custom interior is all new and all amazing. No fake patina here, just funky patterns and upgraded features, plus a dash of style to make driving this 3100 a pleasure, not a chore. A bench seat wears fresh upholstery, with plain door panels to soften the passenger compartment a bit. Factory instruments are gone, replaced by neat-fitting Auto Meter gauges that look like they were born there, all framed by the steering wheel out of a later '50s Chevy passenger car. An AM/FM/CD stereo head unit lives in the top of the dash and comes with a remove, you know, in case reaching over there is just too inconvenient. Carpets on the floor help with noise and vibration, and while that shifter looks vintage, it's a modern Lokar unit connected to a TH400 3-speed automatic.", "It looks like a small block, but it's actually a 4.3 liter V6, which is actually \u00be of a 350 anyway. The added power makes this pickup more than just interesting to look at, and it makes enough torque to feel right in the vintage pickup. Fitted with an Edelbrock 4-barrel carb and a few vintage dress-up parts, it looks right under the hood; not too flashy, but just enough to let you know someone was paying attention. A big aluminum radiator keeps it cool and a set of long-tube headers dump into a custom dual exhaust system. The frame is from a late-model S10 pickup and it's a surprisingly neat fit under the vintage 3100, and brings upgrades like an independent front suspension, power disc brakes, and power steering. It's got an awesome stance thanks to lowering springs and blocks, and those Painted steel wheels with simple hubcaps are the right old school look. Modern whitewall radials complete the vintage vibe.", "An incredible illusion or just an incredible truck? How about both? If you want to attract attention, forget bright red paint and loud mufflers, this patina-covered pickup is the hot ticket.

The truck had recently come out of storage and is simply stunning and beautifully presented in 'Cobalt Blue' paint with a 'Brown & Light Gray' interior! This great daily driving 1953 Chevrolet 3100 series Stepside Pick Up is a turn key ready daily driver for any classic truck enthusiast. The 1/2 ton Chevrolet/GMC pick up was renamed the 3100 in the 1940's and they were outselling the Ford's with a 33.8% market share in 1949 compared to Ford's 21.6%. But Chevy couldn't afford to be complacent and by 1950 there were several welcome improvements such as double acting all around shock absorbers and a circuit-braking lighting system. The Thriftmaster six offered slightly more power due to a Rochester power jet down draft carburetor, larger valves and a straight through muffler. By the year 1955 the Thriftmaster engine was increased to 235 c.i. (3851cc) with an increase in both bore and stroke. GMC as a marque produced a straight six and later a V8. The last GMC straight six engine was the 270 c.i. 4.4L and it was a raised-deck engine produced from 1940 through 1962 and was an OHV/pushrod engine. In 1958 these trucks became known as the Full size C Series for Chevrolet and the 100 Series for GMC. This particular truck boasts a 235 c.i. 'Thriftmaster' engine which runs strong and sounds absolutely magnificent and the truck drives really well - must be driven to be appreciated - drives straight as an arrow with no strange road wobbles, shakes or rattles - a truly remarkable daily driver!This is a very rare opportunity to own a great daily driving and frame off restored example of a very desirable and collectible all American early 1950's Pick Up ready for any classic American truck, collector or enthusiast to enjoy or collect today!"]}},

It's obvious this one was done for love, because it's quite well done without the usual ''upgrades'' that take away from the vintage feel. The bright metallic green paint is just right, shiny but not flashy, practical and forever stylish, and just right for the conservative early '50s. The Advance Design trucks are some of the best-looking of all old pickups and this one gets everything right, from the shiny chrome grille to the beautifully restored chrome bumpers to the big, white CHEVROLET lettering on the tailgate. And speaking of the tailgate, drop it down and you'll find a wood bed that has a bit of patina that makes this Chevy particularly appealing. Other details include painted running boards, new weather seals, and factory-style emblems for just the right period look.", "The interior is basic, no doubt about that, but that's also a big part of an old pickup truck's charm. The original bench seat is wrapped in a fresh tan vinyl seat cover that adds a few pleats for interest. Contrasting dark brown door inserts break up the otherwise all-steel panels and original-style rubber floor mats mean that getting a little dirt inside is no big deal. The original gauges are quite nicely finished with bright numbers and clear lenses and the dash and steering column are painted to match the interior.  There's no radio, because such things were still optional in 1951, but there is an under-dash heater that's remarkably effective should you need it and three-on-the-tree shifting feels light and easy to manage.  The big steering wheel offers plenty of leverage on the unassisted steering, so it even feels reasonably nimble in traffic or, say, the parking lot at the local home center.", "Chevy's smooth and utterly reliable ''stovebolt'' six engine displaces 216 cubic inches and it's powerful enough to make it fun to drive without spoiling the vintage feel. It's quite nicely detailed with black paint on the engine itself, a Chevy Orange valve cover, a correct downdraft carburetor, and a 12-volt electrical system that makes the HEI distributor possible. It starts easily with a great trucky grumble from the single exhaust pipe, and you'll probably find that it goes about its business with a minimum of fuss. The chassis got a good cleaning, too, with original equipment throughout, from the rigid front axle to the 3-speed manual gearbox, to the 4-wheel drum brakes that are perfectly adequate given the truck's modest performance. It's really quite nice under there with no surprises awaiting a new owner and with fresh Toyo radials on chrome steel wheels, it definitely has an old school look.", "You absolutely will not see trucks this nice being this affordable for very much longer.

It utilized a four-speed transmission and two-speed transfer case, with the driver choosing between direct-drive or a 1.87:1 underdrive; in effect, eight forward and two reverse speeds were available. The solid front axle was similar to the one in the rear and also hung from the leaf-spring suspension.

The bed also features a solid lift up tonneau that's covered in a Haartz cloth type material and held up with gas cylinders. The interior continues the fine quality of the outside with a red embossed cloth seat, double weave carpet, red and black painted dash with AM/FM stereo CD player, tilt steering column with LeCarra custom steering wheel. This isn't just another pretty truck, the suspension has been upgraded with an early 90's IROC Camaro sub frame, the rear differential is a Lincoln Versailles posi-trac w/disc brakes, and it rolls on 20 and 22-inch wheels and tires. Power comes from the IROC tuned port fuel injected 305ci engine and 700R4 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission.
