This 1967 coupe is a lovely car that's a pleasure to drive and delivers a fun V8 Mustang experience that you'll definitely appreciate once you get behind the wheel.  ", "  The Mustang's success was based primarily on its ability to be almost all things to all people, and coupes like this one were the reason why the less profitable and more expensive Mach 1s and Shelbys could exist. Nicely presented, the body is straight with no major signs of repair through the years. The bright Springtime Yellow finish looks authentic and shows a few signs of use and age but nothing that would stop you from jumping in and going for a ride. There are a few touch ups and we do like the recently-installed black stripes along the rocker panels that coordinate well with the matching black vinyl top.  Details are correct throughout, including the grille, emblems, and trademark Mustang gas filler cap out back. Chrome on the bumpers is very nice, and the stainless around the windows has a wonderful patina that looks totally authentic. The aforementioned black vinyl top makes this yellow car look masculine and shows none of the usual signs of trouble underneath. There's no question that this is a very handsome car.  ", "  From behind the wheel, you'll be hard-pressed to determine what's living under the hood, since all Mustangs had beautiful bucket seat interiors. However, this one carries a set of modern chairs that fit so well most folks won't even notice that they're not original equipment. They work well with the new carpet and upscale door panels with woodgrained appliques. The fat steering wheel looks sporty with its three spokes, which also give a great view of the stylish Mustang dashboard full of functional original gauges. Although this car probably came with an AM radio originally, it now carries a Sony AM/FM/CD unit that fits in the original location, so nothing was cut or modified in the process. A slender chrome handle with a wooden knob controls the automatic transmission, and the lack of a console seems to be perfectly appropriate in this pony. You also get factory A/C, which wasn't all that common back in 1967 but is quite welcome here. The trunk is neatly finished with correct mats and a full-sized spare tire with matching cover.  ", "  The engine is a C-code 289 cubic inch V8, which was a popular choice and offered a great balance of power and good manners. Although there's no way to be sure, we're fairly certain this is the car's original engine and it looks quite correct in the Mustang's engine bay with Ford Blue paint, a chrome air cleaner with reproduction decals, and original ignition equipment. It's almost completely stock, which means a thrifty 2-barrel carburetor and standard exhaust manifolds, so it's easy to live with on a daily basis. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic that snaps off quick "], "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "9", "price": "19995", "kilometers": 3636.34, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241734", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241734", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "2,260 miles", "Exterior Color": "Springtime Yellow", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
