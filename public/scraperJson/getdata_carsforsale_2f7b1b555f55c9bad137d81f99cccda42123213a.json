So this is the affordable iconic classic is already exactly how you want it.  ", "  This sedan is pure distinction with the jet-inspired ornament on the hood, unique single-year grille, and sweeping side trim that is arguably the most handsome of the Tri-Five era.  Of course, it also helps to have a car that looks this bright. The light copper metallic has a deep luster from a modern clear coat.  The white in this two-tone presentation has the same gloss, so the sunlight loves the body. But we all know the best shine comes from all that iconic chrome and sweeping stainless trim.  People often have problems finding the right pieces for a '56, so we get excited when it's complete just how it is here.  Besides striking, this one is also out for a performance appearance.

The full color theme is continued on the dash, carpeting, and especially the artful door panels.  The overall effect is a well-coordinated total package.  Everything you love about these icons are still in place.  This includes the fan-style gauge cluster and dual-cowl dash that resembles the Corvettes of the era.   But now you also benefit from the best upgrades like the comfortable wood and chrome steering wheel, an auxiliary gauge trio, and an updated AM/FM/cassette stereo with digital tuner.  And best of all, vents have been expertly installed for the modern and cold R134a air conditioning.  ", "  When you lift the hood, the 350 cubic-inch small block V8 looks brand new, and that's because it practically is! There is only about 350 miles on this fresh crate motor.  That means you get the great Tri-Five Chevy small block legacy, but in a fresh and powerful package.  This V8 even benefits from an aluminum intake, four-barrel carburetor, MSD ignition, and long tube headers that feed the rumbling dual exhaust.  The full package is rated around 300 horsepower.  But more than just a powerful icon, this one was built to comfortably drive anywhere.  That's why you have great features like an electric cooling fan, trans cooler, and a 700R4 four-speed automatic transmission with highway-friendly overdrive.  Plus, there's great suspension upgrades like a thick sway bar up front, traction bars in the rear, power steering, and front disc brakes.  ", "  Starting to get the full picture on this one?

This pickup really symbolizes the attitude that jump started us back into peacetime.  With the wood rails on the wood truck bed makes it looks like it could still go to work today.  But take a closer look.  The extra gloss of the lumber matches nicely with the extra luster of the more modern application of the yellow and tan paint.  And if it's shine you like, the bumpers and two-piece wheels really add to this bright presentation.  Plus, the way the panels fit on this pickup, let you know someone took the time in restoration to erase its workman past without erasing its historic appearance.  It's the perfect balance of period-correct and premium.  ", "  The interior is still working-class all the way, but that's all part of the vintage truck appeal. The vinyl bench seat shows virtually no wear, and the same can be said for the door panels and rubber flooring.  Pickups from the 1950s didn't come adorned with a long feature list, and that actually adds to this 3100's charm.  This is part of an era where its heater was a valued option because it gave you a chance to warm up on your way home from working the day in the outdoors.  Those are the kinds of things you think about from this truck's big airy and open cabin.  You get to connect to a bygone era every time you grab the three-spoke steering wheel, rest your hand on the tall gearstick, and gaze at the large original gauge package.    ", "  Under the hood is a 261 cubic-inch inline six. It's an upgrade in displacement over what was available in the 3100 for '55 without losing the iconic Job Master/Stovebolt attitude.  In fact, we know you'll love showing off all the details, from the long blue motor, to the silver oil bath air cleaner, to all the correct markings.  While this is not an all-out speed machine, the four-speed manual transmission ensures you are in complete control of the powerband.  Besides, you don't buy a truck like this for all-out performance.  Sure, a small block fits easily in the engine bay, but your largest enjoyment is watching others see you ride around town in this alluring package.  And right now you get to do that with an intoxicating rhythmic chug that comes from true vintage truck motoring.  ", "  The Advance Design trucks were only in production for less than half of '55 before their successor started coming down the line.  So a rare First Series pickup from 1955 always is a great distinction to have.  And so when you look at the rarity, terrific presentation, and affordable price, you realize you need to hurry to grab this deal.

Three men are generally credited with creating the original Thunderbird: Lewis D. Crusoe, a retired GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II; George Walker, chief stylist and a Ford vice-president; and Frank Hershey, a Ford designer. Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris, Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker, 'Why can\u2019t we have something like that?'", "Walker promptly telephoned Ford's HQ and told designer Frank Hershey about the idea. Hershey took the idea and began working on the vehicle. The concept was for a two-passenger open car, with a target weight of 2525 lb, an Interceptor V8 and a top speed of over 100 mph. Crusoe saw a painted clay model on, which corresponded closely to the final car; he gave the car the go-ahead in September 1953 after comparing it with current European trends. Unlike the Corvette, the Thunderbird was never a full-blown sporting vehicle; Ford's description was personal luxury car, and the company essentially created this market segment. There was some difficulty in naming the car, with suggestions ranging from the exotic to the ridiculous (Hep Cat, Beaver, Detroiter, Runabout, Arcturus, Savile, El Tigre, and Coronado). Crusoe offered a $250 suit to anyone who could come up with a better name. Stylist Alden \"Gib\" Giberson submitted Thunderbird as part of a list. Giberson got the idea during a lightning storm when he saw an illusion of a bird getting hit by lightning, but this happened because of his view. Giberson never claimed his prize, settling for a $95 suit and an extra pair of trousers from Saks Fifth Avenue. According to Palm Springs Life magazine, the car's final name came not from the Native American symbol as one might expect, but from an ultra-exclusive housing tract in what would later be incorporated as Rancho Mirage, California: Thunderbird Heights", "The car was shown at the Detroit Auto Show in 1954. The first production car came off the line in September, 1954, and went on sale in October as a 1955 model, and sold briskly; 3,500 orders were placed in the first ten days of sale. Ford had only projected building 10,000; eventual 1955 sales were 16,155.", "The Thunderbird was revised for 1957 with a reshaped front bumper, a larger grille and tailfins, and larger tail lamps. The 312 cu in V8 became the Thunderbird's standard engine, and now produced 245 horsepower . Other, even more powerful versions of the 312 cu in V8 were available including one with two four-barrel Holley carburetors and another with a Paxton supercharger delivering 300 horsepower . Though Ford was pleased to see sales of the Thunderbird rise to a record-breaking 21,380 units for 1957, company executives felt the car could do even better, leading to a substantial redesign of the car for 1958.", "The '57 is generally considered the most desirable first generation T Bird.", " ", "This very nice example has had only 2 owners since 1970, and has been in the current owners care since 1994. This is a very nice driving car with a drivetrain rebuilt shortly after the current owner acquired the car. The Paint, Interior, and chrome are in excellent condition with only minor chipping on the underside edges of the hood and doors. The car runs exceptionally well, and is perfect for tours and local cruise-ins-this is a car you and drive and show immediately.

But beyond the bold paint of this custom creation there are features like a performance V8, four-wheel disc brakes, and a comfortable interior.  Oh yeah, you get a lot for your money in this one.  ", "  Getting attention has never been difficult for these trucks, but the full custom paint and body of this one gives it a confident attitude that reflects its current south Florida home.  But what really gives this pickup poise at car shows is how the paint is spread over even spaces hardly anyone ever sees (but more on that in a moment.)  From a distance you can recognize the investment on the two-tone turquoise and purple.  This pickup has a unique identity created by how the pink pinstripe that separates these two color create its own bodylines.  But as you get closer, all of the custom work of this unique build really comes into focus. The hood has some great pinstriping that links it to the purple and pink colors seen further down the truck.  Plus, the custom hood scoop, sport mirrors, and rolled rear pan w/integrated taillights give this one a true speedy appearance.  A great American classic also doesn't skip out on the brightwork.  That's why the front bumper, headlight surrounds, and wide mouth grille shine like mirrors.  Plus, the 16-inch wheels add plenty of flash to the profile.  But even with all these great custom elements, this still does not loose the tough spirit of being a real pickup.  Underneath the slick tonneau cover is a real wood bed, and have you noticed the trailer hitch? Yup, you can be the coolest one towing all the toys.  ", "  Pop the remote door openers (the door handles are shaved on this cool custom) to reveal a stunning interior.  There was some serious money invested in producing this custom theme where the exterior purple, turquoise, and pink are all part of a custom pattern that starts at the kick plates, runs across the door panels, and over the seats in a truly seamless presentation (yes, even the bed has the same custom pattern for a truly uniform feeling throughout.) This is not an overbearing pattern because the base is a comfortable gray tweed cloth.  When you sit behind the wheel, the first thing you notice is how the whole dash area was custom painted to match the exterior right down to the tilt steering column.  There are great features like the power windows, AM/FM cassette stereo, a provisions for R134a air conditioning that everyone will like, but the best items are reserved for the driver.  The grippy Chevy steering wheel, Hurst floor shifter, and full set of classic-style VDO gauges immediately let's you know there's something special under the hood.

Save 10% on purchase until July 16, 2017.", "For those seeking a lovely driver from the Tri-Five Ford Series of Thunderbird's you may have struck  gold.  This sleek and great looking 1957 Ford Thunderbird is gleaming in an above average driver quality Starmist Blue paint with an accenting white interior.   It is powered by a great running and peppy 312/245HP engine twisting into a smooth shifting 3-Speed Ford-O-Matic transmission.  Options include an after market air conditioning, (Thunderbird had no A/C options in the day), power windows and the rare factory option  Dial-O-Matic power seats and rides along on new tires.  It does NOT have its original radio.  As the pictures will attest the car has a great look and stance with all bright work holding a nice shine, paint that suits it well and an immaculate interior.  All gauges and accessories operating as designed.  There are a few small blemishes in the paint but only where seams meet but are not a result of rust.  Beneath the car is well maintained  with no visible indications of rust or a hit.  The current owner has had it for approximately three years and is wishing to sell only out of a need for space.  It comes with hard top and tonneau cover only.  No documentation comes with the car therefore it cannot be claimed to have a numbers matching power-train.  The car is located in Villa Rica, GA some 25 miles west of Atlanta just off I-20.  The owner seeks the fair price of $38.5K but will consider other reasonable close offers.
