For the 1953 model year an all-new version of the F-Series made its debut. Increased dimensions improved engines and an updated chassis were features of the second generation. Additionally a change to the F-Series naming scheme would remain in place to the present day. The half-ton F-1 became the F-100 (partially influenced by the North American F-100 Super Sabre) Since then she has undergone a radical restoration. She has received a mildly built 302 that is paired to a strong and trusty AOD from Monster Transmission. This truck has a fantastic rumble to match its style. All the truck appears humble it is packed full of features including A/C a modern retro styled AM/FM radio cruise control heated seats power brakes power steering power locks power windows keyless entry tilt wheel vinyl interior radial tires a soft top tonneau cover to cover the cargo area in the bed. You would be hard pressed to find a better 56 F100 for the value. This truck drives like a dream with the comforts of modern technology and the classic styling of the 50\"??s.

That's because with a performance-built 302 V8, upgraded suspension, and comfy A/C interior, all wrapped in a great vintage pickup body, this offers the best of everything.", "Maybe it's the combination of fat fenders and an already low-looking profile. Or perhaps it's that unique front end. Or maybe the real wood truck bed.  Whatever the reason, this F-100 looks fantastic from just about any angle.  The light blue paint is a big help with this appearance.  It's a great shade to represent the pop art of the '50s, especially with supporting elements like the classic Ford family crest leading the way, more Ford crests on the step plates, and vintage chain-latch tailgate.  But this paintwork also has a more modern shine, thanks to over $30k spent on a restoration in 2014. The modern shine helps introduce more aggressive features like the shaved front bumper, rolled rear pan, bright exhaust tips, and 20-inch Ridler wheels.  All of which help hint at the upgrades within.", "The interior was restored with an eye for good coordination.  So the white accents of the exterior return on a nicely tailored white bench seat, new matching door panels, and matching piping on the carpet.  They coordinate with the exterior blue that are on the metal elements like the dash and upper doors.  This is meant to be a comfortable cruiser, and so you get upgrades like the removable center console with cup holders, AM/FM stereo, and modern R134a air conditioning all nicely integrated into this interior.  But more than just comfy, you can also instantly tell this was built to be a performance machine.  You slip behind the Grant sports steering wheel on an Ididit tilt steering column.  Just beyond that are a full set of Dolphin gauges that do a great job of looking retro cool thanks to their markings and the chrome instrument panel.  The tall floor shifter even has a nice performance feeling.", "When you lift the hood, you'll instantly recognize a motor that was built for both show and go.  After all, the smooth inner fenders and firewall are painted to match the exterior and so is the air topper.  And just about everything else was given a sold investment in a polished presentation.  And there's plenty of substance behind the style. You're looking at a BluePrint 302 cubic-inch performance crate.  It has all the right go-fast goodies like an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, performance intake, and shorty headers that feed the rumbling dual exhaust.  But beyond just more power, this pickup has been built with plenty of great modern features like front disc brakes, modern Toyo Proxes tires for grip, three-speed automatic transmission, and a TCI Mustang II style independent front suspension for a superior ride.  You even have an aluminum radiator with an electric fan to keep this performance V8 running cool when you're in traffic with the A/C pumping.  So this is truly an everyday friendly F-100.", "Complete with build receipts, you know you're looking at a terrific all-around custom build.

It just takes pieces like an expertly deleted front bumper, expertly deleted trim, and wider rear fenders to really make this classic come alive with modern flair.

Your right hand rests comfortably on the Lokar shifter, and your left one will love the grip of the sports steering wheel. There's even upgraded petals and auxiliary gauges, including a SunPro tach on the tilt steering column.   But even with all these upgrades, the classic style dash and instrument cluster really give you a great feeling for a '50s Ford.", "The engine bay is perfect for showing off.  After all, the red firewall and black inner fenders do a great job of funneling your attention to all of the polished components.  With the air topper, valve covers, alternator, and intake all shining so brightly you know it can easily draw a crowd.  And behind this style is plenty of substance.  This is a 350 cubic-inch crate motor.  And while this fresh V8 is powerful right out of the box, it has nice enhancements like a Quick Fuel four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, an aluminum radiator w/electric fan, and a rumbling dual exhaust.  Since this is strong package with all the right strong-running accessories, you'll also be glad they made it easy to take on the road.  With power steering, power brakes (w/discs up front), and a TH350 three-speed automatic transmission, this F100 is a fantastic cruiser.", "Complete with plenty of build/maintenance receipts and the owner's manual, this is a head-turning custom that's ready to hit the road today.
