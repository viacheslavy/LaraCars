The car's lights look great and its bodywork is straight and solid. This Prancing Horse rolls on Yokohama radials, size 205/55ZR16 in front and 225/50ZR16 in back. Each donut surrounds a five-spoke alloy wheel with the prancing horse on the yellow center caps. The wheels and tires are in satisfactory order.", "Under the hood is Ferrari's 3.2L, 32-valve DOHC V-8 engine (F105C040) with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and breathing via quad exhausts. At their core, all Mondial engines comprise a Ferrari-cast lightweight alloy V-8 block with 90\u00b0 bank-angle; shrink-fit cylinder liners; a five-bearing, flat-plane crankshaft with paired connecting rods on each journal; belt-driven, quad overhead camshafts (two per cylinder bank) acting directly on the valves; alloy crossflow cylinder heads; and a wet-sump lubrication system.", "Engine capacity started at 3.0L and increasing to 3.2L for the Mondial 3.2 and culminating in 3.4L. Mirroring the two-seater Ferrari V-8 vehicles, all 3.0 and 3.2L engines sit across the car with their crankshaft and cylinder planes transverse to the main vehicle axis. Front trunk hood struts will need to be replaced. Like the new Ferrari 328, the Mondial's engine grew in both bore and stroke to 3.2L in 1985. The Mondial 3.2 was first presented at the 1985 Frankfurt Auto Show in September that year.", "A five-speed, all-indirect manual transmission using a \u201cdog-leg\u201d selector pattern was the only transmission offered. Instead of the conventional \u201cH\u201d shift pattern, this arrangement (also known as a \u201creverse h-gate\u201d) has 1st gear situated to the far left and back, behind reverse. This pattern has been popular with racing gearboxes, as it allows quicker, more direct shifts between second, third, fourth and fifth, gears. The parking brake light is on at the dash, although the brake does disengage. The service light is also on at the console.", "In the 3.2 models, the transmission housing is integral with the engine sump casting, albeit with its own oil supply, sitting below and slightly to one side of the main block. Drive to the gearbox is via a single-plate, diaphragm-spring clutch and a set of drop-gears located outboard of the left-hand end of the crankshaft, with output torque feeding into a friction-plate limited-slip final drive unit offset to the rear of the gearbox. Output from the final drive to the rear wheels is via a pair of short, solid driveshafts fitted with constant-velocity joints at each end to allow for suspension articulation.", "For these models, clutch actuation is hydraulic, unlike their two-seater cousins' cable systems, and transmission selection is via a rod which extends through the center chassis tunnel and passes through the engine sump into the transmission housing.", "Although based on the two-seater vehicle designs, Mondials are slightly larger overall including having appreciably wider front and rear track dimensions. Suspension systems are fully independent all-round, comprising unequal-length upper and lower wishbones, coil-over damper units and anti-roll bars at each end of the vehicle.", "Steering is a rack-and-pinion mechanism sitting ahead of the front wheels, unpowered on all 3.2 models. Braking is via four-wheel ventilated discs with split-circuit vacuum assistance on all vehicles.", "Inside, the tan Connolly leather seats are in very good order, as is the matching carpet. All seats, including those in the rear, are strongly bucket-shaped and fitted with inertia-reel seatbelts; three-point in front, two-point in back. Note: The rear seats will need to be installed. A central tunnel for the chassis structure is prominent in both front and rear footwells and is straddled by a large front center console with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The A/C does blow, but not cold. The handbrake is located outside the driver's seat beside the inner sill and is a \u201cdrop-down\u201d design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a steering column adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a \u201cpod-style\u201d instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, oil pressure and oil temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of warning lights and electronic check panels. The center console and shifter look good and a JVC AM/FM stereo with CD player completes the interior, though we doubt the next owner will use it that much, considering the much better mechanical symphony that plays every time he presses the \u2018go' pedal.", "Available in both Coup\u00e9 and Cabriolet forms, styling refreshed with restyled and body-colored bumpers, similar to the 328 with more integrated indicators and driving lamps, and new alloy wheels with a more rounded face. The 3.2 also boasted a major interior update, with a more ergonomic layout and a more rounded instrument binnacle. Fuel injection remained the primarily mechanical Bosch K-Jetronic (CIS) with an O2 sensor in the exhaust providing feedback to a simple computer for mixture trimming via a pulse modulated frequency valve that regulated control fuel pressure. The ignition system was Marelli Microplex, with electronic advance control and one distributor per bank of the V-8.", "\"It is a car with few rivals, perhaps the closest being the Porsche 928S\u2026once you have experienced the wonderful noise produced by the V8 engine in full cry, and sat behind that steering wheel, with the power surging in, you can forgive the car for the few detractions it may have. They seem to pale into insignificance as the rev counter needle sweeps past the 7000-rpm mark and you slam that gear lever through the gate. It is a different world of motoring.\" Autocar 1986", "\"I marvel at how little compromise it asks. All the panache of a mid-engine Ferrari with plenty of head room too...The length, as Paul Fr\u00e8re says, makes the handling very easy. Longer wheelbase means less angle for rear movement and makes it easier to drive the car. And I like how nicely it responds to the accelerator. Backing off for corners, it comes out just right. Even the American version now goes much quicker than the early European version. The Mondial is a good compromise between ride and handling.\"  Road and Track 1986", "Competition to this Ferrari in 1986 included Aston Martin's Volant\u00e9 Convertible, Chevrolet's Corvette Convertible, Maserati's Biturbo Spyder and Porsche's 911 Carrera Cabriolet.", "Ferraris are exclusive but this is a rare find even for a Ferrari so you owe it to yourself to visit MotoeXotica Classic Cars to check this one out as soon as possible.", "VIN: ZFFXC26A6G0065691", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

In 1987 Cadillac started sending Eldorado frames to Pininfarina to be shortened and then the body assembled and sent back to Detroit in a modified 747 to have the drivetrain installed.  Only about 3,000 per year were built over the  seven-year run. Over time several mechanical upgrades to the engines were done to increase the horsepower   from the initial 4.1 V8 to the 1993 with the Northstar 4.6. All the early models  and most later were delivered with the  removable hard top.", "This 1988 Allante has a Silver exterior and red interior that just seems like the right color for this car. The lines of the car however are simple and clean. The hood slopes down to a rectangular grill with the Cadillac emblem proudly displayed in the center flanked by rectangular headlights. Body colored bumpers have chrome strips set into them for a little flash and there is a thin chrome line running down the side of the car. Clean lines continue at the back of the car with simple rectangular taillights with Cadillac in script on them. The manually operated convertible roof is black and in addition, there is a Silver removable hardtop that is nice for use in the winter and gives the car an entirely different look. The car sits on factory alloy wheels with Cadillac centers all around.  Open the door and you will find a door panel sets the tone for the interior There are power windows and locks at your fingertips as well as a two-position seat memory switch that controls dual Recaro 12-way adjustable seats that are comfortable and supportive works of German engineering and art. A unique two-spoke wheel sits in front of a digital dashboard with easy to read displays and the original 43,200 miles showing on the odometer. Controls for lights, wipers, and cruise control are at your fingertips just below the display with the climate control system as well as the driver information system within easy reach in the center console. At the bottom of the console is the GM/Bose symphony sound system that was, and still is, a great sounding system. Below the stereo is the T-handle shifter for the 4-speed automatic transmission and in the back, you will find a good-sized trunk plenty big enough for two sets of golf clubs.", "Under the hood you will find a 4.1-liter V8 with a tuned intake manifold system that feeds high-flow cylinder heads. It sits transversely in the engine bay because this is front wheel drive car, (which is a big reason that the trunk on this car is so large). An F-7 4-speed automatic transmission gets the power to the front wheels and an independent strut type of suspension handles the curves in this roadster without sacrificing Cadillac ride quality. A Bosch antilock brake system operates 4-wheel disc brakes for safety and performance and the rubber meets the road through matching radial tires all around.  The alternator, A/C Compressor and rear brakes have recently been replaced. These cars were way ahead of their time and now are a very affordable appreciating convertible."], "Exterior:": "Silver", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto"}},

The Carrera 3.2 was offered from 1984 through 1989 and has a well deserved reputation of not only high performance but also near bullet proof reliability.  Beginning in 1987, Carrera 3.2s were equipped, as this car is, with the Getrag five speed transmission providing smooth, easy gear changes not found in earlier modes.   The 1987 through 1989 Carrera 3.2 is considered on its own to be one of the great air cooled Porches and even greater in terms of value for the dollar.  This car has had only two owners for approximately the past three decades.  While not yet confirmed, we have information to indicate there may have been only three owners since new.  It has a clean CarFax report and its excellent overall condition indicates it has received great care from all of its stewards.    As is common with this model, the odometer stopped functioning a time or two but this was given prompt attention by its current owner.  While the actual mileage exceeds the indicated 47,400 odometer reading, the condition of the car is a testament that the difference cannot amount to very much.  We invite and encourage prospective buyers to have a pre-purchase inspection performed.  We are confident you will not be disappointed.  The paint and interior is all but flawless and the car drives as well as it looks.  One fault we know of is the sunroof is not working.  Our shop can repair this for a new owner or we can negotiate a discount to cover that cost.  This Carrera represents a great opportunity to enjoy Porsche motoring.  It offers a wonderful combination of the classic air cooled Porsche while still being new enough to have amenities that make it comfortable to use.  Plus as time goes by, it is reasonable to expect the next owner will see the car appreciate in value.
