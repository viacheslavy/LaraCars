So while this 1983 Mercedes Benz 380SL might look stunning on the outside, the true stunner is the 350 Chevy small block under the hood.  ", "  We'll get more into the interesting V8 power in a moment, but what really needs to be appreciated first is just how stealthy this Benz really is.  It does a great job of disguising the powerplant upgrade behind a great-looking R107 Mercedes.  This SL retains its elegant lines, and that's only heightened by the professional application of the Charcoal Gray metallic paint.  There was plenty invested just so this sunshine-friendly droptop truly looks great on every sunny day.  And great paint deserves a great canvas.  The body has the quality panels, precision gaps, and confidence-inspiring door 'thunk' that you expect from every luxury Mercedes.  In fact, the only hint that this isn't a full factory car are the wire wheels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an international symbol of a sporty upgrade.    ", "  The tan pinstripe running down the exterior profile is a nice introduction to this car's leather interior color. Beyond just the perfect hues, this car is desirable because inside is pure Mercedes luxury.  The seats, carpets, dashboard, wood grain and center console are quite correct and have the kind of condition that lets you know this was never left out in the sun. There are plenty more great luxury features, including power windows, power locks, power steering, and the desirable Becker Grand Prix AM/FM/cassette stereo.  And you'll be especially glad to know that on a droptop like this, the air conditioning is a modern R134a unit that's blowing cold.  And for those days when you don't what to share the experience with the world, this Mercedes comes with both the folding soft top and removable hardtop.  ", "  But the real decision-maker on this car is in the engine bay. Just imagine pulling up to the car shows and popping the hood... the reactions from people are worth the asking price alone! But this upgrade to a Chevy 350 cubic-inch V8 is more than just about showing off.  The motor is built with upgrades such as a four-barrel carburetor and Weiand intake to give you a true extra wallop of power.  And the exhaust was crafted so that all people see is the standard left side exhaust.  This is the right mix of Chevy and Mercedes parts, because the V8 is mated to a trusty TH350 three-speed automatic transmission, but you also still retain the precision driving of the fully-independent suspension and four-wheel disc brakes.  ", "  This is the best of everything in a very affordable package.  But something so unique and complete doesn't come around very often, so you need to hurry if you want to make this Benz/Chevy yours.

Hagerty values a #2 @ $17,000 and NADA is even higher @ $22,300 for average. Clean Carfax. The R107 Mercedes roadsters (1972-1989) have gained in value tremendously over the last couple of years. We don't think there is another one of these anywhere that is nicer for this money!! Someone will get a great buy on this car and have lots of fun driving a terrific investment.

Automatic Trans. Only 69,335 miles. Pacific Northwest car from new. The 380SL is a heady mix of V-8 power, refined luxury, and sporty underpinnings in a classic and timeless design. This 1983 Mercedes Benz 380 SL could almost pass for new. If you look close enough, long enough, you can eventually spot a tiny blemish or two in the exterior paint, but it is practically flawless. The black leather interior is brand new. The matching door panels are in good condition and the dash pad is free of cracks or sun damage. All of the gauges (oil pressure, temperature, gas gauge) work, as does all of the safety equipment (lights, wipers, horn, seat belts, etc.). The tachometer and speedometer are also functioning. The clock works as does the cruise control. Of course the factory air conditioning works properly and blows cold. Overall, this is one of the nicest 1983 Mercedes Benz 380 SL Roadsters that we've come across in quite some time.A fabulous example of Mercedes' luxury sports car, this Red and Black beauty is an exceedingly well-kept, extremely low-mileage and always-garaged example of the great SL line. This car came from the factory with the 3.8 liter fuel-injected V-8 engine. With only 69,335 miles, it eagerly starts at the turn of the key, idles smoothly and pulls strongly. The automatic transmission shifts cleanly and smoothly, just as one would expect from a premier luxury sports car. The brakes function very well, the car stops quickly without pulling to either side. Out on the open road, it feels like a modern sports car with nice acceleration, tight handling and just a great overall feel. It is quick, comfortable, eye-catching and, not to be forgotten, fun to drive.The car is fully equipped with Power steering, Power disc brakes, Cruise control, Power windows, Power locks, original Becker AM/FM/Cassette stereo. The convertible's soft top is in great condition. The raising and lowering mechanism works properly and, when lowered, the top stows under a fiberglass/metal boot. The chrome and stainless trim is in very good to excellent condition. All of the windows are in great condition and operate correctly with their power assists. The body of the car is free of any rust issues. The matching door panels are in good condition and the dash pad is free of cracks or sun damage. All of the gauges (oil pressure, temperature, gas gauge) work, as does all of the safety equipment (lights, wipers, horn, seat belts, etc.). The tachometer and speedometer are also functioning. The clock works as does the cruise control. Of course the factory air conditioning works properly and blows cold.Excellent from top to bottom, this 1983 Mercedes-Benz 380SL is a fine choice as a collectible 1980s convertible, and these sought after models are poised to really start climbing in value, this is certainly the example that you'll want in your garage.
