The XK120 had become a formidable competitor in club-level motorsports and the factory soon developed a full-race version officially known as the XK120-C (for Competition) which we all know simply as the C-Type. XK120 running gear was mated to a lightweight tubular frame that was skinned in a beautiful alloy body. The light and powerful C-Type won the 24h of Le Mans on its first attempt in 1951 sparking a string of victories at the French Classic that would last through the 50s. One of the key developments of the C-Type was the use of Dunlop disc brakes in 1953 which truly revolutionized motorsport and were largely responsible for the C-Type\u2019s second win at Le Mans in 1953.In 1954 the D-Type was unveiled as a revolutionary replacement for the C-Type. The traditional tubular chassis was scrapped in favor of a light and strong monocoque chassis. The stunning bodywork was largely the work of Jaguar\u2019s aerodynamics-obsessed stylist Malcolm Sayer. Power came from the proven XK-series inline six in 3.4 or 3.8-liter form (with a 3.0-liter version run in 1958) and fed by either a trio of Weber carburetors or Lucas fuel injection on later cars. The D-Type\u2019s shape played a key role in its success \u2013 proving to be more than 12mph faster down the Mulsanne straight than the brutish 4.9-liter Ferraris. With the D-Type Jaguar scored 3 more victories at Le Mans in 1955 1956 and 1957 and its sophisticated construction would inspire the next great Jaguar road car; the E-Type of 1961.When it came to racing the E-Type however Jaguar seemed to stumble. Management was unsure of how to approach a proper racing version to compete with the likes of the Ferrari 250 SWB and GTO and they took a bit too long to settle on a concept. The first attempt was a fixed roof car in the spirit of the D-Type. This car famously known by its registration number \u201cCUT 7\u201d featured Malcolm Sayer\u2019s new low-drag bodywork that was riveted and bonded in place. The gorgeous car was undeniably an E-Type yet had a distinctly racier appearance. Rather than develop the low-drag Jaguar shifted focus to a lightweight all-alloy version of the E-Type roadster of which twelve were built. They featured an aluminum tub and alloy block XK engine but the styling was essentially the same as the road car. The ultimate E-Type came when German Jaguar distributor Peter Lindner and his racing partner Peter Nocker combined the lightweight and low drag concepts. The so-called Lindner-Nocker E-Type was based on Lindner\u2019s own factory-built Lightweight and adapted with Sayer\u2019s low-drag panels. It was enormously fast and more than a match for the Ferrari 250 GTO at Le Mans and one can only imagine what Jaguar could have accomplished had they put the might of the competitions department behind it. Sadly Lindner was killed in the car and it was locked away for decades before it was carefully restored in 2011. One other factory lightweight E was developed into a Low-Drag car famously known by its registration number of 49 FXN. This car would ultimately score the most success on the track and is still active in historic racing today. Despite the fact that only three cars were built in period the legend of the Low Drag E-Type has inspired many to create their own versions for race or road and recreations are formidable competitors in historic motorsport around the world.We are very pleased to offer this gorgeous Jaguar E-Type Lightweight Low-Drag coupe. Based upon a 1962 E-Type this stunning car has been built from the ground-up to comply with FIA sporting regulations and is legal for both track and street. The fabulous low-drag bodywork was built by Jacob Engineering in the UK using the finest components finished to a very high standard. With its exposed rivets and aggressive stance the look is said to be inspired by the famous 49 FXN albeit with a few personal touches. It sits low on a set of period-look Technomagesio peg-drive wheels which mimic the look of the original Dunlop alloys but with the strength and durability for modern track use. Sticky Avon CR6-ZZ DOT-race tires give the right period-correct look while offering up excellent grip and handling characteristics. Quality of the metallic silver-gray paintwork is very good and the car has been carefully enjoyed in the hands of its most recent owner who maintained it as part of a large collection of significant Jaguar road and racing cars.Featherweight aluminum doors feature sliding Plexiglas side windows and simple door cards trimmed in black. The purposeful race-focused cockpit is protected by an FIA-approved roll cage but is also trimmed with carpet and sill upholstery to provide a modicum of comfort. The windscreen is heated for clear vision in all conditions. Required FIA safety devices include a plumbed fire system interior and exterior electrical cut-off and Willans 5-point harnesses. It is currently fitted with period-correct 3.8-style seats trimmed in black leather and a pair of ultra-light form-fitting race seats will also be included for track duty. The current owner updated the steering with a tilt/telescopic column for additional comfort whether on the road or the race course.Beneath the alloy bonnet sits a 3.8-liter XK inline six that is reportedly good for well in excess of 350 horsepower. Built in the UK by the highly respected Jaguar specialists Rob Beere Racing it is remarkably tractable for road use but is also enormously capable on the track. The engine is mated to a 4-speed all-synchro gearbox and the suspension is fully dialed in to provide excellent balanced handling. This car is seriously quick and in the hands of the current owner (an active vintage racer) was highly successful in JCNA Slalom Competition (Autocross) scoring the second fastest time for the 2016 season and once beating Jaguar\u2019s current F-Type R by a full four seconds. It is believed to have run a number of important UK and European events in the hands of its first owner. More recently it has done some vintage racing including an appearance at the Lime Rock Historics.\u00a0It is currently US-titled and registered for road use and the sale will also include previous UK V5C registration documents the MSA HTP (Historic Technical Passport) and the all-important FIA documents which allows entry into virtually any European historic event. Expertly prepared and well-sorted this gorgeous E-Type Lightweight hints at what could have been if Jaguar followed Malcolm Sayer\u2019s lead and developed the E-Type to take the fight to the Ferrari GTO."]}},

Here we have one of the quietest and most flexible cars on the market, capable of whispering along in top gear at 10mph or leaping into its 150mph stride on the brief depression of a pedal. A practical touring car, this, with its wide doors and capacious luggage space, yet it has a sheer beauty of line which easily beats the Italians at their own particular game.\u2019There have been few better summaries of the E-Type\u2019s manifest virtues than the forgoing, penned by the inimitable John Bolster for Autosport shortly after the car\u2019s debut. Introduced in 3.8-litre form in 1961, the Jaguar E-Type (XKE in the USA) caused a sensation when it appeared, with instantly classic lines and 150mph top speed. While, inevitably, the car\u2019s stupendous straight-line performance and gorgeous looks grabbed the headlines, there was nevertheless a lot more to the E-Type beneath the skin.The newcomer\u2019s design owed much to that of the racing D-Type; indeed, the E-Type would be one of the last great sports cars developed directly from a successful competition ancestor. Just as in the D-Type, a monocoque tub formed the main body/chassis structure while a tubular spaceframe extended forwards to support the engine. The latter was the same 3.8-litre, triple-carburettor, \u2018S\u2019 unit first offered as an option on the preceding XK150. With a claimed 265 horsepower on tap, the E-Type\u2019s performance did not disappoint; firstly, because it weighed around 500lb less than the XK150 and secondly because aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer used experience gained with the D-Type to create one of the most elegant and efficient shapes ever to grace a motor car.Developed from that of the original XK120 sports car and refined in the racing D-Type, the double wishbone, independent front suspension was mounted on the forward subframe that supported the engine. The rear suspension broke new ground for a large-capacity sports car, being independent at a time when most of its major rivals relied on the traditional live rear axle. Dunlop disc brakes were fitted to all four wheels; those at the rear being mounted inboard alongside the differential to reduce un-sprung weight. Only in terms of its transmission did the E-Type represent no significant advance over the XK150 whose durable four-speed Moss gearbox it retained.Despite the E-Type\u2019s gorgeous appearance, taller drivers could find its interior somewhat lacking in space, a criticism addressed by the introduction of foot wells (and other, more minor modifications) early in 1962. But of all the versions of Jaguar\u2019s long-lived and much-loved sports car, it is the very early \u2018flat floor\u2019 3.8-litre cars built prior to February 1962 which, for many enthusiasts, remain the most desirable.This wonderful Flatfloor roadster has recently been imported from a significant collection in Dubai.

Like the XK120 of 1948 Sir William Lyons again relied on his proven strategy of balancing affordability with exotic looks and race-proven technology. He and his chief aerodynamicist Malcolm Sayer worked together to design the new car using lessons learned with the revolutionary multi-time Le Mans-winning D-Type. The new E-Type mimicked the D-Type with its semi-monocoque tub utilizing bolt-on front subframes to support the engine and independent front suspension. The car also featured the ingenious modular independent rear suspension with inboard brakes pioneered on the Mk10 saloon. The E-Type\u2019s impressive spec sheet included four-wheel disc brakes torsion bar front suspension and a 3.8 liter version of the proven XK twin-cam inline six pumping out a startling 265 horsepower that could push the XKE to nearly 150 mph \u2013 the kind of performance expected from a car costing twice as much.While the E-Type could been a hit based solely on its impressive mechanical spec it was the gorgeous body that stole the headlines. Available as a Coupe or Open Two Seater (Jaguar parlance for a roadster) the curvaceous E-Type was a smashing success from day one. It is said that co-designer Malcolm Sayer had little interest in designing a car based purely on aesthetics; instead he was far more interested in applying his aerodynamics experience from the D-Type toward a design that allowed the form to follow function. Ironically the E-Type turned out to be somewhat aerodynamically inefficient yet is among the most important aesthetic designs of the 20th century. Thankfully Jaguar gave it the performance to back up the looks and a well-driven E-type could easily hang with a contemporary Ferrari or Aston Martin yet it cost a fraction of the price of those exotic machines.This stunning 1962 Jaguar E-Type \u201cFlat Floor\u201d OTS is one of the finest examples we\u2019ve had the pleasure to offer. A highly desirable early production car it was first dispatched from Coventry on November 22nd 1961 bound for Jaguar North America. The car was titled as a 1962 upon its sale to its first owner listed on the Heritage Certificate as J.L. Rein of Santa Monica California. Beginning in 2002 it was treated to a full concours-quality restoration by the Jaguar specialists at Classic Showcase of Oceanside California. Exquisitely presented in stunning colors and specification this strikingly beautiful car has scored numerous 99 and 100-point finishes in JCNA concours competition won Best in Show at the 2016 International Jaguar Festival scored a class win at the 2015 Arizona Concours was shown at the Pebble Beach Concours d\u2019Elegance in 2015 and won its class at the 2016 Streets of Carmel show.As expected of a world-class restoration the body is impeccably prepared straight and correctly aligned. As this is a late 1961 production model it is fitted with the correct inside bonnet locks in combination with the early-style weld-in louvers. The color is resplendent and the quality of the paintwork is truly outstanding. Under bonnet and underbody surfaces are equally impressive with the finish work done to better-than-new standards. Chrome bumpers and body fittings are excellent and the car rides on a set of sparkling chrome wire wheels with correct knockoffs and period correct Dunlop SP radial tires. No detail has been left untouched and the presentation is gorgeous.The 3.8 liter XK engine is of course correctly finished to the minutest detail. The matching-numbers engine is topped with the original cylinder head. This is one of the last cars to feature the pumpkin orange-paint on the head which was only used on engines built prior to November of 1961. Every aspect of the engine bay has been scrutinized and found to be absolutely correct according to JCNA standards. Showing only 400 miles since the restoration was completed it remains in impeccable cosmetic and mechanical order.The same level of care has been applied to the interior which is beautifully restored in tan leather carpet and Hardura. The quality is stunning and with limited mileage since being completed it remains in beautifully fresh condition. Details include an original radio blank plate correct early-style shift knob and the signature alloy instrument panel and console inserts. The Fawn soft top is taut and in excellent order and is covered by a matching fawn canvas top boot when covered. Additional items include a correct original tool kit and jack hinged front plate bracket hammer owner\u2019s manual maintenance chart and even the original California black plates.Since the restoration was completed this car has been part of a significant collection of Jaguar sports cars where it has been methodically maintained and brought to the highest level of detail. It remains in truly outstanding mechanical and cosmetic condition and is ready for enjoyment on the road or on the lawns of the world\u2019s finest concours events."]}},
