The engine has less than 1000 miles on it since rebuild and has been given some performance upgrades such as an Edlebrock performer intake and carb and Hedman headers that we had Jet Hot coated after fitting them. The door and panel  gaps on these cars were notoriously bad from the factory and we spent hundreds of hours massaging them to near perfection. The body is laser straight and the GM arctic white paint is miles deep. Since completing the restoration a couple years ago, we have brought it to car shows and won two trophies.

The market is moving on these cars, and this high-visibility example still attracts attention everywhere it goes.", "Recently repainted a vivid shade of bright orange that sure looks like traditional Carousel Red, this Firebird is exactly the opposite of subtle. Forget all the jokes about flying chickens on the hood, because this one has a clean, chiseled look that suggests horsepower without the added graphics. It was apparently a clean, honest car before the repaint, too, and has ended up as an ultra-sharp reminder of what performance was like in the '70s. Gaps are good all around, and Pontiac gave it a great look with a modestly aggressive front bumper, a set of Formula badges, and a ducktail spoiler out back, all of which remain in excellent shape. The paint is two-stage urethane, so it has a great shine that's virtually indestructible, and the shiny trim along the lower edges emphasizes the length of the car, making it long and low. It's not perfect, of course, but it's got an awesome look that'll stand out among all the Trans Ams you see at shows.", "Tan buckets were the best way to travel in 1976, and the classic color combination ensures that this Poncho will always be in demand by collectors. The seats are comfortable and supportive thanks to firm foam underneath, and the seat covers themselves are nice reproductions that show very little wear since the restoration. The center console houses the original shifter for the TH350 3-speed automatic transmission as well as a handy storage bin, and the gauges look quite good considering their age. The original AM radio is gone, replaced by an AM/FM/cassette head unit, but the factory 8-trcack is still hanging underneath. Other options include factory A/C (needs service) and power windows. The trunk is in nice shape with a reproduction mat and a vintage-looking spare tire with jack assembly.", "While a lot of engines were down on horsepower in the mid-70s, Pontiac engineers were better than most at keeping their top engines at the top of the horsepower charts, and the 350 cubic inch V8 in this Firebird is a good runner. Thanks to proper maintenance and minimal modifications, it runs great, so it's ready to enjoy without worries. It wears Pontiac Turquoise paint, a Rochester 4-barrel under the original air cleaner, and a brand new dual exhaust system that probably adds a few horsepower. The chassis is in fantastic condition with shiny black floors and a new gas tank, and a set of reasonable gears in back make it an effortless cruiser. Wheels are the traditional Pontiac Rally IIs which wear 235/70/15 blackwall radials at all four corners.", "Five years ago, we told you that this day was coming, and now it's here.

This Verdoro Green drop top features what looks to be the original 350 cubic inch small block V8 and Turbo 350 3-speed automatic transmission connected to the 10-bolt rear axle. The motor does indeed turn over with some squirts of fuel into the carburetor and a jump pack on the battery. A rarity for sixties convertibles is the factory air conditioning system found on the Firebird. Another desirable option is the power convertible top that does go up and down, however, the top material is deteriorated. Inside the cabin are bucket seats and a center console shifter. The upholstery looks good on the bucket seats but the rear seat has major tears. The dashboard and gauges are in very good original condition. Power steering and dual exhaust round off the option list. This Firebird is prime for restoration and has a solid trunk and floors. The bottom of the doors look to be in good shape with only signs of some surface rust. The drivers side quarter panel looks to have been replaced at some point and there are various rust areas on all four wheel openings. The front nose has damaged corners as well. Still intact are the vibration dampers, also known as cocktail shakers in the trunk. The glass is all there and the windows roll up and down properly. Included with the project car are the original 14 Pontiac hubcaps. This Firebird Convertible seems to have all the original parts in place and would make a great candidate for restoration.
