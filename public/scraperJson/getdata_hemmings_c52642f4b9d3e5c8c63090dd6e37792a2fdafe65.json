And we especially like the subtle one that highlights the full c-channel crease in the sheetmetal's profile.

But more than just the right color combo, you'll love this one because they made the right investments.  For example, the bucket seat covers and carpeting are newer to give this classic a fresh feeling.  You get the vintage Mustang three-spoke sports steering wheel.  That gives you a clear view to the wide speedometer flanked by readouts for all the important info.  Plus, that bright Hurst shifter is just calling out for your right hand in all the darkness.", "This C-code Mustang has a correct 289 V8 under the hood, but you can instantly see this has been upgraded for show and go.

Plus, this V8 has been given performance upgrades such as a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock intake, Mallory coil/distributor, and a nice set of headers that feed the stainless dual exhaust.  And you have complete control over this enhanced V8 and its rumbling soundtrack thanks to the three-speed manual transmission.", "The sale comes with good paperwork, including the original dealer invoice and owner's manual.

The Ford Mustang was introduced unto the world on April 17th 1964. The Mustang conceptualized from the already popular Ford Falcon provided the American working-class with a chance to own a modest sports car with a modest price tag all without sacrificing overall enjoyment or amenities.Shortly after beginning production in mid-1964 the Mustang underwent extreme body modifications every couple of years the first small tweak is seen here with this 1967. The 1967 and 1968 models were elongated by a few inches with modifications to the car taking place in the front nose as well as the sharpening of the body lines along the sides while the rear taillight panel would now present itself with an indention rather than a protrusion. Smaller underpowered 8 cylinder motors were now offered with larger displacement than the first two production years as well as more horsepower and more amenities (such as back up lights).Upon decoding the VIN and datacode plate we find that this particular C-Code 1967 (original 289cid v8 2bbl) was birthed in the San Jose plant before being shipped to Seattle for sale. An additional comfort that we find in this decoding of the Mustang is that this 1967 was Candy Apple Red from the factory as well as adorned with black buckets making her trim-code matching and very period-correct.For more information and to view dozens of HD pictures and a video of it running and driving please visit www.GATEWAYCLASSICCARS.com and dial (708) 444-4488.See more at: http://www.gatewayclassiccars.com/CHI/1459/1967-Ford-Mustang"], "Exterior:": "Red", "Condition:": "Good", "Mileage:": "30,082"}},

Traditional ponies like this 1965 Ford Mustang coupe are a great way to own an icon without spending a ton of money, and when they carry a few clever updates, they make wonderful hobby vehicles that can still be enjoyed every day.", "Seriously, if you could own a classic V8-powered Mustang coupe for less than the price of a new one with a 4-cylinder engine, why wouldn't you leap at the chance? Especially one with A/C, power steering, and disc brakes? Nicely refinished, this Wimbledon White coupe carries all the timeless design cues that put these cars at the top of every enthusiast's wish list. Bodywork is well done, it has a classic color combination, and everything lines up well enough to really attract positive attention at local shows. The line that runs along the tops of the fenders is as sharp as a crease in Don Draper's suit, and the paint is shiny without looking too modern. It's got the correct front grille with the ''crosshairs'' in the center emblem, optional chrome trim on the quarters, and it's nice that it hasn't been forced to wear stripes or wings like so many of its siblings. The chrome is in very shape, too, totally in line with the rest of the car, giving it a clean all-of-a-piece look.", "Red upholstery makes the interior a brilliant place to spend some time. Restored with the rest of the car, the interior offers a lot of new components, including seat covers, door panels, dash pad, and carpets, all of which show very little use. Factory gauges all work properly and you'll note there's a custom center console with cup holders that is a modern addition that adds practicality. The original AM radio has been replaced by an AM/FM/cassette head unit and that's a recent A/C system tucked under the dash, not quite like it would have been in 1965 but still very slick. Power steering is a desirable option, even on the lightweight Mustang and the three-spoke steering wheel that controls it is in excellent shape as well. Even the trunk is correctly finished with a plaid mat and spare tire with matching cover.", "Classic performance in a Mustang means only one thing: a snappy 289 cubic inch V8. This is a C-code car, so you get a relatively economic 2-barrel carburetor that still delivers plenty of V8 punch. And when your car runs this well, there's really no need for upgrades and modifications, instead letting the spirit of 1965 flow through you whenever you're behind the wheel. It fires easily and has a snarky V8 exhaust note thanks to a fresh dual exhaust system. Ford Blue on the engine makes it look right, and it's pretty much the way Ford intended, from the air cleaner to the big radiator, although the A/C compressor and power dual master cylinder are modern additions. The undercarriage is not shiny, but if you're into driving instead of polishing your car at static shows, you'll never even notice, and front disc brakes have been added. A C4 3-speed automatic transmission spins the original 8-inch rear with tall gears inside, so it's great on the highway. 14-inch styled steel wheels look great on any early Mustang, and they're protected by 195/75/14 Goodyear whitewall radials.", "We seem to be getting lucky with early Mustangs here at Streetside Classics, but don't wait for the next one, you need to put this lovely '65 coupe in your garage right away!

This car was built in San Jose and stayed in California until 1994.  This all original car was purchased in the Los Angeles area in November 1968 and stayed in the family since then. The original Purchase Receipt from 1968 is included.   Everything is original except for the convertible top that was replaced in 1986, the padded dash and the AM/FM/CD player. All the gauges are original and are operational including the dealer installed Rally Pack except the clock does not work. The C4 3 speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly and 289 V8 with 2 bbl carburetor runs great. The engine still has the California air pump installed.  The power steering has a little play in it which is normal for a 50 plus year old car. The power top operates normally but there is a rip in the fabric above the back window.  The car was repainted eleven years ago and kept the original candy apple red color.  This vehicle has been driven as intended but also maintained as the substantial amount of receipts dating back to 1968 can prove. The original interior is in great shape with no rips or tears.  The back seat is faded but still holding up very well for its age with only some minor cracking on the back seat and wear in the piping on the drivers seat.  We can arrange shipping to your location. If you have any questions, please contact Savannah Classic Cars 912-235-2347."], "Exterior:": "Candy Apple Red", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "148,020"}},

The all original stock cars certainly have their place and are appreciated but unless you are just going to local shows they aren't very ideal. That is where the restomod comes in. These cars take a vintage look and upgrade it with more modern technology to make it much more road worthy in the current times. The cool 66 Mustang Coupe you see here is done in the Restomod style with a little hotrod flair to make it one cool custom. The body of the car is nice and straight with no problems. It is painted in a Silver metallic color with Black racing strips and the finish has a great shine. The top of the car was painted a gloss Black as well which creates a really cool look. It almost references the old vinyl top cars. A custom hood has been added that incorporates a cowl with two small scoops up front. This gives it a really neat appearance from the front especially because the hood fits with the racing stripes so well. An aftermarket custom grill has been added as well as the Shelby style front valance. The Weld Racing wheels under the car have a nice shine and look very tough.", "The wider tires in the back let you know it has a little more packed under the hood than it did originally. It is now powered by a 347 Stroker motor that runs very strong. It has been built up with an aftermarket cam, AFR aluminum heads, MSD distributor, and Ford Racing valve covers. It has a great sound and the car runs down the road nicely. The motor is paired with a C6 Automatic transmission that smoothly shifts power back to the Ford 9 inch rear end. Disc brakes have been added all around and are power assisted.", "The interior is done in Black and is all custom. The upholstery work looks great and the inserts are done in a honeycomb pattern that looks really cool. The center console was custom built and incorporates cupholders, storage space and a ratchet style shifter. The original gauges have been redone with white overlays and a second underdash gauge bezel has been added for oil, amp, water as well as a tachometer with shift kit. An aftermarket stereo has also been installed and is a Pioneer AM/FM/CD/Bluetooth unit that sounds great. The trunk is painted Black and houses the fuel cell.", "This Mustang has a great look and sounds extremely tough. Whoever ends up with it is going to have so much fun tearing up the streets!
