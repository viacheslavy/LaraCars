Fords new C-4 cruise-o-matic three-speed auto transmission became available for the 225 HP V8. The 289 HiPo K-code engine was also offered with a c4 transmission but it had stronger internals and can be identified by the outer casing of the servo which is marked with a C. The long duration solid-lifter camshaft that allowed the high revving 289 to make the horsepower it was known for was not friendly for a low stall speed automatic torque converter. The HiPo could be spotted very easily by the 1-inch-thick vibration damper (as compared to 1/2 inch on the 225-hp version) and the absence of a vacuum advance unit on the dual point distributor. With the valve covers off there is a large letter K stamped between the valve springs along with screw in studs (vs. a pressed in stud for other 289s) for the adjustable rocker arms. A large number of new paint and interior color options an AM/eight-track sound system and one of the first AM/FM mono automobile radios were also offered.
