It?s stunning. It?s simply amazing what a heated garage, meant specifically for cars, will do for the preservation of a car/truck. The inside of the cab was also stripped down, and had all of the hard surfaces painted. New seat coverings, head liner, and door panels, etc. The owner also used stainless a steel plate between the tailgate and bumper to bridge the gap normally seen. to add another touch of class, Look closely and you will also note that the tailgate has a recessed cutout for the license plate and a new light hidden above it to shine the light on the license plate.  What makes this truck better than all others is that it?s all original. The original 6 cylinder 235 engine has been rebuilt as well as the transmission, the Hydromatc transmission is one of the most unique inventions you?ve ever seen. The demand for manual transmissions eventually meant the demise, of the Hydromatic. The Chevrolet 235-cubic-inch is known as one of the great Chevrolet engines, noted for its power and durability.  This 235-cubic-inch (3.9 L) version was added to cars in 1950 to complement the new Powerglide automatic transmission, and 3.55:1 rear differential. Hydraulic lifters were used in the Powerglide 235 and a fully pressurized lubrication system was introduced in 1953, but only in cars ordered with the Powerglide transmission For anyone not thrilled about the headliner, door panels or seats, can opt to ask us about changing them out to something different, or color neutral. Jim has already got a plan for the trucks interior and would be happy to talk to any serious buyer about these options.    This truck can be purchased for as little as $25,750. For additional information, please call Jim at 206-406-1313This is a very rare numbers matching truck with all original equipment, along with the very rare Hydromatic transmission. Because they didn?t make a lot if them, demand goes up.If you have any questions please reach out to Jim at 206-406-1313"], "Mileage:": "22708"}},

The sharp white is contrasted by the most functional elements such as body gap seals, tires, and protective cover for the real wood truck bed.  And this is already on top of one of the best vintage pickup designs around.  That aggressive forward-canted attitude is further emphasized by the custom stance.  Plus, the curvy bodywork has a classic old pickup look that also manages to be sporty at the same time thanks to fiberglass running boards and rear fenders.  Are you starting to get the picture on this one? Good. Because the chrome on the bumpers, cool chrome grille, and two-piece wheels will drawn in the crowds just in time for you to flip up the hood (more on that in a moment.)", "Trucks from the 1950s were built to be pure utilitarian machines, but that history is erased the moment you open the door.  The nicely reupholstered black leather bench seat has padding and pattern separation for individual comfort. This custom setup even matches the door panels and headliner.  Plus, the center console is a huge upgrade since the passenger themselves were the only cup holder than came standard in 1954. The same pristine white on the exterior returns to dominate the dash, but what sits directly in front of you is a cool banjo-style three-spoke sports steering wheel.  Beyond that is a full set of AutoMeter gauges.  If you look on the dash, there a few new switches for modern lighting, and there's even one to electronically reveal that clamshell hood.  Yup, just like you, we're having fantasies of pulling into the cruise-in and lifting the front without ever getting out of the driver's seat.", "One look at the engine bay, and you can instantly see some nice work that has gone into this 350 cubic-inch small block.  With the clamshell hood cutting low into the engine bay, everyone gets a good look at the upgrades like the Edelbrock intake, Holley four-barrel carburetor, braded steel lines, Edelbrock valve covers, and performance headers.  Plus, there's always something cool about getting an up-close look at a V8 creation like this.  But, anytime you feel people are getting too near, the howl of the sidepipe dual exhaust will do a fine job of scaring them away.  More than just a show-off, this custom pickup was built to be driven.  The TH400 three-speed transmission does a fine job handling the power, as does the Dana 44 rear end.  With a new power steering rack, new driveshaft, power brakes, and the grip of BF Goodrich T/A radials, this 1950s machine is a lot of fun on the road.", "This is an affordable turnkey custom build is just looking for someone to add gas to the tank and rocket down the road.

The Bonneville played an important part that year in the introduction of two of Pontiac's greatest marketing inspirations \u2014 the split grille and the Wide Track slogan. The latter was not just ad copy, either, as Pontiac pushed its wheels further out toward the fenders than anyone else and created what were considered to be the best-cornering full-size cars in the industry. Both the grille design and the Wide Track phrase remained part of Pontiac's image up to its termination. A \"Safe-T-Track\" differential, used to minimize wheel spin, was an option beginning in 1959.
