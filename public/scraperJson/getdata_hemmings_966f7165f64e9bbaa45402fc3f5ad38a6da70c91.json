This one is the first of the breed with a V8 and a 4-speed.  It has been repainted a beautiful shade of blue-gray that is guaranteed to turn heads and just begs you to get in it, drop the top, and go for a cruise.", "Silver Smoke Gray is the official color of the car.  It is a calming, soothing, color that catches the light nicely in a way that highlights the crisp clean body lines of the car.  There is white GT stripe low on the car between the wheels that really complements the classic white convertible roof when it is up, or the white boot cover when the roof is down.    The bumpers, as well as various other chrome and polished brightwork pieces, add a tasteful splash of flash to this car.  Of course, there is large running Mustang front and center on the grill.  The front fenders have 2 more smaller ponies backed by red, white, and blue stripes, and 289 badging announcing what is under the hood.  The clean lines of the back of the car are finished off with chrome exhaust tips, and the whole package sits on chrome Magnum wheels with Mustang center caps.", "The white roof is classy and really looks great when it's up, but getting in and hitting the button to drop the top brings the sky and your surroundings in. The blue interior of this car really compliments the paint color.  Door panels that are pleated match the seats for a complimentary look.  A sculpted, stock dash looks great and helps keep the gauges shaded from the sun, especially while top down motoring.  The stock radio is even still in place and has a cool Mustang graphic running across the face of it. Settle into the bucket seat, and feel that 3 spoke black and chrome steering wheel in your hand.  Hit the key and reach for the floor shifter to get this car in gear and get it rolling.  Enjoy an escape ride for yourself, because convertibles are good for that, or load up your friends and head out for some fun, because top down motoring is fun no matter how you do it.", "The sweet 289 cubic inch engine in this car is just what the doctor ordered.  And it's also the way it was originally ordered.  This engine makes great power and wants to run, revving freely when you ask it to.  There are a few nice touches like gold valve covers and master cylinder cap along with a polished air filter housing dressing up the engine bay.  The power it makes flows back through a 4-speed transmission letting you pick the gear you want to be in for cruising, and a leaf spring rear end gets the power transferred to the ground.   Front disc brakes provide great stopping power to reign in those ponies as needed, and steering control comes from a control arms suspension with coils springs and a sway bar to keep the front end planted on twisty back roads.  The 215/75R14 tires front and rear work well and the whole package is balanced making this car a joy to drive.", "Settle into the seat, and take a spin.

If you're reading this, then this high-visibility 1965 Ford Mustang coupe didn't sell immediately upon arrival, which has about a 50% chance of happening each time a new pony shows up. If there's one car you can bank on, it's the Ford Mustang.", "You can't go wrong with bright colors and this one wears a coat of brilliant yellow paint, which sure gives this coupe a look that gets noticed. We like it when early Mustangs are honest, and this one doesn't need stripes, scoops, or wings to stand out, instead relying on the famous Mustang look that's one of the most beloved in the entire automotive world. Workmanship is pretty good, and starting with a good southern car never hurts, although the finish does have some signs of use and most of the trim is original. The quarters are straight and clean, the doors fit well, and details stand out against the shiny paint. Check out the sharp crease that frames the side cove, the chrome insert, and the shiny chrome bumpers that glitter. The '65s had a cross-hair emblem in the grille, so they're easy to spot and this is a real C-code car, so the '289' emblems on the front fenders were earned the right way.", "The Mustang's interior looks great in any form, and the recent black Pony upholstery looks dressy when combined with that bright yellow paint. It looks like most of the interior soft parts are recent, including the seat covers, carpets, and door panels, and they all match the factory stuff exactly. The original dash carries factory instruments including the original wide speedometer with bright markings, and the knobs and handles are in good shape. The floor-mounted automatic shifter reminds you that the Mustang could be configured just about any way a customer wanted, so this one is dressed up without being over-done. There is no radio, but that means it's ripe for an upgrade and the dash hasn't been hacked up, so it will be easy to make it look right. The trunk carries a correct mat, spare tire, and a matching tire cover.", "This is a real C-code car, and the 289 cubic inch V8 under the hood sticks to the original formula. That means a 2-barrel carburetor, a smooth, torquey idle, and Ford Blue paint on the engine and valve covers. The only notable deviations from stock include the open-element air cleaner and a power dual reservoir master cylinder on the firewall, which works in conjunction with front disc brakes, a nice upgrade. The C4 3-speed automatic is quick-witted enough to be a great dance partner when the road starts to twist and the door tag says it carries 2.80 gears, making this a great highway cruiser. It has also been upgraded with a mellow-sounding dual exhaust system, so it sounds like a Mustang should sound without getting too aggressive around town.

But fast forward a few years later and, while sales were still plenty strong, the ''pony car'' category was getting a little crowded, with Ford feeling some heat from increased competition. Recognizing that a full 20% of all Mustang sales occurred in their own state, the California Ford Dealers got together to market a factory-built, limited edition version of the Mustang that would give the model a sort of ''handmade'' cache. This unrestored 1968 Ford Mustang California Special, with a rebuilt engine and transmission, is a bona fide member of that select original and highly coveted group and comes with a letter of authenticity from Ford, a Marti Report and is listed in the GT/CS registry.", "This '68 still features its original code T - Candy Apple Red paint, and what a great shade it is, with plenty of tasteful flash to it. The signature black decals running down its front fenders and doors still have sharp edges and have resisted any serious fading, and the body panels remain well aligned, allowing the doors to open and close smoothly. Those distinct features the California Ford Dealers chose to add on all those years ago - the fog lights and hood pins up front, side scoops on the flanks and the rear spoiler and elongated tail lights are all well-represented here, and their overall impact really did create that ''custom-built'' look the Ford Dealers were going for. Being a California car, this California Special has also had the fortune of being away from the salted, corrosive roads found in much of the country, so you'll find none of the half-eaten rocker and quarter panels you so often see in vintage Mustangs.", "The interior remains clad in the same black vinyl it rolled off the factory assembly line with, still in very good shape considering its age. The dash area looks especially fresh, with the instrument cluster carrying a textured black finish that's still very close to its original hue, with gauges all still easily readable behind clear lenses. A vintage-look AM/FM with iPod connectivity sits in the middle of the dash, offering far more audio options than its predecessor could. The factory air conditioning remains in fine form, more than capable of keeping you and your occupants comfortable through the well-located factory-installed registers. Mustang attained a nice degree of functionality with the Mustang interiors of this era and you'll find that, despite the car's fairly modest size, there's more passenger legroom in both front and back than you'd likely expect. A full-sized spare with nearly all of its tread remaining sits in back in the trunk, which is lined in signature Ford plaid.", "In addition to their unique exterior features, California Specials were also well-equipped mechanically. There's a 289-cubic inch V8 under the hood and, with just a little over 1500 miles under its belt since its rebuild (transmission too) and the documentation to prove it, it's just getting broken in, idling well and pulling smoothly. It's C4 3-speed automatic transmission is known for its durability and snaps through the gears smoothly for a comfortable ride. Out back, 2.79 gears make it a superlative highway cruiser and modern components in the A/C system mean this is a car you can drive coast-to-coast. Standard chrome GT wheels are part of the CS package and carry 215/70/14 BFGoodrich T/A radials all around.", "If you're looking for a rare classic Ford that combines serious collectability with all the vintage Ford charisma you could possibly want, you have to check out this 1968 Ford Mustang California Special.
