The Mustang is a true legend as it is responsible for the whole Pony Market/Craze that swept the late 60\u00c3\u00a2??s and into the early 70\u00c3\u00a2??s. When many of the other wannabe pony cars ceased production, the Mustang model is still going strong with over 50 years of production since the beginning. With so many early Mustangs produced, sometimes a little something different is needed to make your Stang stand out from the others. From the outside, this just looks like another \u00c3\u00a2??C\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d code 65 Mustang. Actually, this coupe was a originally a 6 cylinder Mustang as indicated by the \u00c3\u00a2??T\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d in the VIN. Engine swaps are popular and definitely a nice way to set this Mustang apart. Pop the hood and a late model factory fuel injected 5.0 engine will greet you. The restoration on this beauty was performed about 8 years and this is when the 5.0 EFI V8 was installed. The 4-speed automatic AOD also found its way into the Mustang. Not only does the AOD give you an extra gear for cruising, but it is a much stronger and reliable transmission than the C4 transmission that originally came with this car. Keeping this coupe well maintained the current has had the following items replace in the last year; fuel tank, fuel pump, carpet, headliner, front brakes, alternator, cam, lifters, cylinder heads reworked, timing chain set and 19 lb fuel injectors are all new pieces. If you are looking  for a 1st gen Mustang with a modern drivetrain, then give us a call. Options for this 1965 Ford Mustang Include; AM/FM radio with CD player, Seat Belts, Cloth Interior, Aluminum Alloy Wheels with Radial Tires. .

A first-generation red Mustang convertible is the car that defines an era and is always in demand.  So to find an original 1966 Ford Mustang droptop in a deep and distinctive color is the kind of timeless package that's priced to move.  ", "  Bright red Mustangs are a staple of a good car show, and nobody will ever get tired of them. But to properly own this icon, you need to standout just a little bit.  That's why this one has a sportier attitude that you instantly see from any angle.  Up front it's the addition of the hood pins and hood scoop; the sides have upgraded Mag wheels; and the rear has the dual exhaust coming out of the valance like a cool GT machine.  But even with these upgrades, all your favorite pieces are still in place. There's the correct grille with the running pony emblem, 289 badges on the fenders, and the three-element taillights.  Plus, the bumpers have recently been re-dipped so these chrome kings can truly catch the sunlight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c exactly what you want on a sunshine-friendly droptop.  ", "  The white roof looks great in place, especially as it coordinates with the tire stripe.  But a classic like this was meant to be shared with the world.  And when out fold the roof down, this cheery white disposition turns to a darker performance attitude.  We really like the presentation of the bucket seat interior that look like the door panels and carpeting have received recent attention.  This is a great place to experience vintage driving thanks to the classic three-spoke sports steering wheel with Mustang center cap, and the center console with T-bar gear shift for the three-speed automatic transmission.  And while this looks factory-correct, right down to the trunk mat and a full-sized spare tire, there are some nice upgrades.  For example, the retro-style AM/FM stereo has a digital tuner and an input for modern music players.  And the upgrade to white faces on the round gauge package adds to the clarity and sportiness.  ", "  The 289 cubic-inch V8 looks like it has received the right attention and investments.  It's nicely dressed with its bold blue block, shiny valve covers, and Monte Carlo bar across the top.  Plus, this one is upgraded for power with the hood scoop feeding the performance air element, Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and Edelbrock intake.  That means an extra kick of V8 power going down the road and an enhanced rumble from the dual exhaust.

Nicely finished and clean from top to bottom, this Mustang has been built as an all-around performer that you can be proud to show at the local cruise nights.  ", "  There really isn't much you can do to an early Mustang to improve its looks, so the fellow who built this one focused on getting it straight instead. The sheetmetal appears to be all original, with none of the usual tell-tale signs in the quarters, so you know this was never a wreck. Two-stage urethane creates the shine, and the paint is exactly right for a Mustang: bright and cheerful with a hint of aggression. It also works really well with the slightly more formal coupe body, and the white C-stripe works best on the '67-68 models. A Mach I style hood scoop was installed and painted to match the bodywork, while the original grille has been upgraded with a set of GT fog lamps. Chrome bumpers have been retained front and rear, as well as all the original Mustang emblems.  ", "  The car's black interior looks ready to cruise, thanks to a set of factory bucket seats. Wearing nice reproduction seat covers, it has a very correct look and remains comfortable enough to drive every day. The floor is covered with original-style carpet, and the door panels are accurate reproductions that lend an upscale feel to the interior. A fat wooden steering wheel takes the place of the skinny original piece, and there's a white-faced tach attached to the steering column. Factory gauges remain in place as well, and even though they're a little faded, they work properly. Entertainment is compliments of a modern AM/FM/CD stereo system that has been nestled into the original radio's spot in the dash and drives new speakers located on the rear package shelf. You also get a nicely-dressed trunk with a correct mat and full-sized spare tire with matching cover.  ", "  As I mentioned, power comes from a 289 cubic inch V8 that has been augmented with parts like an Edelbrock intake and 4-barrel carburetor, new ignition system, and a set of long-tube headers. It was originally a C-code 2-barrel engine, so it's a real V8 car, and the extra power will always be welcome. The engine bay isn't showy or detailed, although it's clean with satin black inner fenders and Ford Blue on the block itself. Edelbrock contributed a set of cast aluminum rocker covers and a matching air cleaner, creating a clean, simple look that works well with the car's personality. Those long-tube headers feed a FLowmaster dual exhaust system, and the 3-speed automatic transmission snaps through the gears without hesitation. Check out how clean the floors are, wearing just a hint of red overspray, just like it should be. Wheels are late-model pieces that resemble vintage Torque Thrusts and carry big 17-inch Firestone rubber.

"mileage": "30502", "description": ["In 1964 production was in high gear for the newly designed 1965 Ford Mustang. The highly anticipated Ford Mustang was honored by being named the Indianapolis pace car of 1964 and Ford stepped it up to accommodate the rising status of their new design. A special convertible version was adapted as the pacer. It was manufactured in white with a blue stripe on the hood and trunk. Ford also made 230 extra pace cars, available in convertible and hard top. The 64 1/2 convertibles had a 289cid engine, and the hardtops came with the less powerful 260 V-8. Thirty five convertibles were sold to dealerships and 195 hardtops were given out in dealer contests held in April of 1964.", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang for consideration. The current owner of this vehicle has owned it for nearly 2 decades and claims to have loved every second of ownership. The vehicle features a full body-off restoration that was done in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina back in 1995. You\u2019d never guess that the restoration was over 20 years old, this vehicle shows like new all the way around and runs like it just rolled off of the line. Vehicle features a new top, new power steering, aftermarket radio, a 260 cubic inch V8 engine, 3 speed manual transmission and much more. A very well done exterior/interior restoration and also mechanically, this 1964 1/2  Mustang is a proven driver, and is turnkey and ready for immediate use.", "The Ford Mustang remains an American icon and is hands down, one of the most recognizable cars ever produced.
