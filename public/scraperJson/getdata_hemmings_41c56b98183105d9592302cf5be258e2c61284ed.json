The first model A ever manufactured was produced on October 20th, 1927, but the new Model As were not sold until December 2, 1927, and were offered in four standard colors.  In February of 1929, only two years into production, one million Model As had been sold. By March of 1930, Model A sales hit three million, and body styles were offered in 9 variations; Coupe (Standard and Deluxe), Business Coupe, Sports Coupe, Roadster Coupe (Standard and Deluxe), Convertible Cabriolet, Convertible Sedan, Phaeton (Standard and Deluxe), Tudor Sedan (Standard and Deluxe), Town Car, Foudor (2-window, in Standard and Deluxe), Fordor (3-window, in Standard and Deluxe), Victoria, Station Wagon, Taxicab, Truck and Commercial. When production of the Model A ended in March of 1932, there were 1,507,132 1929 Ford Model As produced and only 4,954 Model A Station Wagons manufactured.  The engine of the Model A was a water-cooled L-head 4-cylinder with a displacement of 201 cu in. The engine provided 40 hp and top speed was around 65 mph. The transmission was a conventional 3-speed sliding gear manual unsynchronized unit with a single speed reverse. The Model A also featured 4-wheel mechanical drum brakes. This car was the first Ford to use the standard set of driver controls (with conventional clutch and brake pedals, throttle and gearshift) and the first car produced to have safety glass in the windshield.  Our Ford Model A ?Woodie? Wagon is an exceptional example of a faithfully restored and lovingly maintained car.   The engine was recently rebuilt and runs smooth and faithfully.
