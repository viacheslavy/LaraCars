The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964 models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates in August 1964 at the \"formal\" start of the 1965 production year contribute to tracking 1964 production data separately from 1965 data with production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan, on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.\"\"Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a \"1964\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.Several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170 to 200 cu in (2.8 to 3.3 l) with an increase from 101 to 120 hp (75 to 89 kW), and an upgrade of the V8 engine from 260 to 289 cu in (4.3 to 4.7 l) with an increase from 164 to 210 hp (122 to 157 kW). The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a trim ring with a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as \"1964\" Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.\"American Dream MachinesAt American Dream Machines, we typically have over 100 quailty classic cars and trucks in stock and for sale.

The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964 models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates in August 1964 at the \"formal\" start of the 1965 production year contribute to tracking 1964 production data separately from 1965 data with production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan, on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.\"\"Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a \"1964\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.Several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170 to 200 cu in (2.8 to 3.3 l) with an increase from 101 to 120 hp (75 to 89 kW), and an upgrade of the V8 engine from 260 to 289 cu in (4.3 to 4.7 l) with an increase from 164 to 210 hp (122 to 157 kW). The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a trim ring with a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough difference to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as \"1964\" Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.\"American Dream MachinesAt American Dream Machines, we typically have over 100 quailty classic cars and trucks in stock and for sale.
