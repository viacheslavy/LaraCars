But a complete restoration to everything from the bold red paint to the 420+ hp 427 V8 makes this 1968 Chevrolet Corvette a true dream machine that's available today at a gone-tomorrow price.  ", "  Red Corvettes are so iconic that they write songs about them.  And this car truly knows how to inspire a tune.  That's because there has been an investment in the 1968-correct Rally Red to give this classic color a modern shine.  That means sunlight rolls off the shark-like nose and tall fenders so evenly that you can't help but attract attention.  Even the details received all the right attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the doors shut with confidence; the big block hood has the proper 427 callouts; the body gaps that appear quite even; and the headlight door fit flush. Trim and chrome look good, including the optional luggage rack, and it pairs up well with the clean, 15-inch rally wheels. So the total package is certainly a Stingray that will stand out from the crowd.  ", "  Inside, the correct saddle tan interior looks great against the red paint.  You can instantly tell by the condition of the bucket seats, door panels, carpeting, and dash that there has been a nice investment in keeping this looking its best.  Corvettes have always been a great personal sports car by providing a nice mix of performance features and plenty of creature comforts, and this one does it right.  You get a three-spoke steering wheel that gives you a commanding view of the large dual pod gauges for the speedo and tach.  Just to the side are a full set of auxiliary readouts for all your vital info.  Plus, accessories like the AM/FM stereo and clock were rebuilt to look correct while still being useful.  But we know your favorite part of this coupe will be lowering the power windows, taking out the T-tops, and removing the rear window so you can hear the big block road while enjoying the backroads.  ", "  Tilt the hood forward to reveal year-correct 427 cubic inch V8.  This big block was part of the full restoration, and so it's ready to be shown off with the polished valve covers, distributor shield, and the air grabber that boldly proclaims its power superiority.  And when you look beyond the shine, you will see the substance of a rebuilt V8 that has been upgraded and fortified.  This includes a bored .30 kit, a rebuilt JET Performance four-barrel carburetor, and a host of new parts, including timing chain, gaskets, camshaft, lifters, pistons, and so much more.  But Corvette fans should take note, because this Stingray was highly original before restoration, many of the original components come with the sale, too.  This creates that perfect balance where you get a big V8 that fires-up easily and delivers reliable performance (dynoed at 423hp!) and at the same time, you get to continue its factory history.  So it's a classic you can enjoy.  And this is only heightened by great anytime driving f"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars - La Vergne", "title": "1968 Chevrolet Corvette ", "total_results": "70 .

Great color of one-year only offered British Green over Tan interior! Rare, first year t-top coupe possessing RPO L36 big block 427ci V8 producing 390 horsepower! Act quickly! Modeled after the Mako Shark show car, the new C3 generation of Corvette was introduced in 1968 with entirely new bodylines! Although not officially re-titled the Stingray yet, the C3 generation lasted a lengthy 15 production years with only minor changes to the exterior styling. Today, they are among the most sought after, and affordable classic Corvettes on the market today! Finished in very desirable British Green (983) over Saddle interior (420), this numbers matching 1968 Corvette Coupe comes loaded with options! Starting with its original L36 427ci V8 producing 390 horsepower, you get a rare first year M40 3-speed Turbo-Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering, power brakes, 3.08:1 Heavy-Duty Posi-Traction rear axle ratio, original Delco AM/FM push-button radio, 15 wheels with bright metal wheel covers, red stripe Yokohoma radial tires, removable T-top roof panels & rear window, faux wood steering wheel, carpeted floor mats, and original Soft-Ray Astro-Ventilation side glass! The major component numbers are below: Engine cast number: 3916321 HI-PERF (1968 early cast number) Engine cast date: L 28 7 (Dec 28th, 1967) Engine VIN stamp: 18S412269 Engine date stamp: T0214 IQ (Feb 14th, 1968- 427ci/390hp with automatic) Transmission stamping: 1101203 (non-original) Rear end date code: 1AW 2 8 68 W (3.08:1, Feb 8th, 1968) Nearly 28,600 vehicles were produced for this new generation Corvette, but only 9,936 were built in the T-top coupe form making them a little more difficult to find, especially with favorable options and original equipment! This particular example is showing 47,529 miles that may be original, but we do not have enough evidence to support a true mileage claim. The frame remains wonderfully rust free, smooth, and solid. The exterior paint and interior seat upholstery were refinished previously and continue to show well with only minor visible wear or small flaws. All of the electrical and vacuum systems are functional including most of the interior fiber optics, all interior courtesy lamps, headlight operation, factory radio, dash lights, wipers, horn, etc. The brake calipers have been replaced for stainless steel versions, new brake master cylinder & booster, and new shocks can be found at all four corners. A more modern Vette Brake Products(VBP) fiberglass rear monospring was installed. A new battery was installed in May 2017. It will come complete with T-top storage bags, owners manual, original jack, wrench, and spare tire. It runs terrific without any disappointments! Please feel free to call with additional questions or to schedule an opportunity to view the car in person.
