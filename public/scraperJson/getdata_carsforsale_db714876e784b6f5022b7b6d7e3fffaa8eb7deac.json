"mileage": "85065", "description": ["The Riviera is a large personal luxury car produced by Buick from 1963 to 1999 with over 1.1m produced. The first generation models were instantly praised for their beautiful proportions, sporty performance, and all new design cues. The third generation was introduced in 1971 and featured dramatic \u201cboattail\u201d styling and a unique \u201csweepspear\u201d that was like nothing else on the road. A wrap around rear window and flat fenders was a tribute to the Corvette Stingray. The 455cid V8 and three speed automatic transmission was standard and made about 255hp. Unfortunately, sales numbers were small, which makes it a rare item today.", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this excellent, all original 1972 Buick Riviera for your consideration.  Finished in Arctic White over dark green, this is a unique combination. Having just four owners, this Riviera is in honest, survivor condition. Paint quality is good and even, but has lost a bit of that luster that a good buff would bring back out. Likewise, the chrome trim is very good but could use a polish. The original stock alloy wheels are wrapped by whitewall tires. Glass pieces are in great shape. The dark green interior is very nice and the seats are nearly perfect. The dash and door panels are also nice. Everything appears to be working, including the fan and the original radio. The car has power windows, power seats, power steering, power brakes and more.", "The current owner has had the car for a little over a year and has taken great care of the car and claims that everything is original.

HISTORY  The Buick Riviera was GM's response to the popular Ford Thunderbird. Instantly recognized as a design classic, the original Riviera was Motor Trend magazine's 1963 Car of the Year. The svelte 117-inch wheelbase personal luxury coupe was a pet project of GM styling head William L. Mitchell.  Only astute Riviera fans can tell a 1964 from a '63 at a glance (hint: check the hood ornament). New for 1964 was the optional dual-4-bbl, 425-cid, 360-hp \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Super Wildcat 465\u00e2\u20ac\u009d V-8 (At the time, Buick identified its engines by torque rating, instead of horsepower or displacement).  The leaner and meaner looking 1965 Riviera closed out the marque's first-design generation with newly stacked hidden headlamps, taillight units integrated into the rear bumper and optional chromed five-spoke wheels. A new Gran Sport package combined added exterior panache with the 2x4-bbl Super Wildcat engine. First generation Rivieras are enjoying a renewed appreciation. The rare\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand truly high-performance\u00e2\u20ac\u201d1965 Gran Sport (3,354 produced) is the most valued edition. However, any fine 1963-65 can be driven and shown with pride.

luxury car produced by Buick from 1963 to 1999. GM's first entry into that prestige niche, the Riviera was highly praised by automotive journalists upon its high-profile debut. While early models stayed close to the original form, eight subsequent generations varied substantially over the Riviera's thirty-year lifespan. In all, 1,127,261 were produced. The Riviera was radically redesigned for the 1971 model year with flowing and dramatic \"boat-tail\" styling. Designed under Bill Mitchell's direction, it was penned by Jerry Hirshberg, future head of design for Nissan, mating the two-piece vee-butted fastback rear window, inspired by the 1963 Corvette Sting Ray split-window coupe, to the Riviera's platform.", " ", "GR Auto Gallery is pleased to present this one owner 1973 Buick Riveria for consideration. Over the last 44 years, this vehicle has been meticulously maintained and never neglected. The vehicle has recently been repainted in Kodiak Brown Metallic and it sure does look nice after receiving a professional detail, it's still shining as if it just came out of the paint booth. The power plant in this Riveria is the 455 cubic inch V8 and is paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission, both are original and have not been replaced or rebuilt. Some replaced parts and upgrades include; newer tires, newer battery, newer rotors, pads, drums, linings, belts, hoses, filters, radiator, fluids, newer carpet, newer seat covers and cushions, newer headliner, newer vinyl rooftop and much more. A total exterior body and trim restoration was done in early 2015 where all the original paint was removed, minor body rust removed and filled professionally and then finishing the vehicle in 3 coats of primer, 2 coats of base, and 2 coats of clear in Ford\u2019s Kodiak Brown Metallic.

First and foremost, they want something that's super cool. Secondly, they want something that's correct. And last but not least, they want something that doesn't require a second job to finance. Fortunately, the gearheads at RK Motors Charlotte pride themselves on specializing in first rate classics of all kinds, and they always have cars, like this awesome '67 Buick, that are a perfect fit for anyone. With a 430 cubic inch Wildcat V8, a stylish Black interior and striking Plum paint, it's certainly some of the coolest metal to ever roll out of Detroit. Thanks to years of meticulous preservation, it can be paraded without worry. And as a virtually untouched survivor that's priced at only $50K, it's the bargain of the century! So, if you're in the market for a fully pedigreed classic that combines tons of character with an unbeatable price, this unique Riviera is the car of your dreams!     BODYWORK/TRIM     Inspired by Bill Mitchell's love of hand-built London coaches, the second generation Riviera features a classy body shell that conveys a sense of style and sophistication perfectly befitting its exotic name. And the incredible shell you see here, a stunning Riviera Plum survivor, wears completely original aesthetics that have been exceptionally maintained. Consistently providing its various owners with rock-solid reliability and a sense of custom-tailored comfort, the car has never been separated from its chassis. Original chrome and stainless, which exhibit minimal signs of wear, show almost as well as the day they left the dealership. And presently, this Buick's desirability as something that's as rare as it is unique is both genuine and fitting.    ENGINE    While the exterior of this slick E-Body does an excellent job posing for world-class visuals, the engine compartment is where Buick purists REALLY start to take notice. And for good reason too, because the car's original, 360 horsepower Wildcat V8 is the kind of powerhouse that makes people either put up or shut up. Turn the key and a big Rochester carburetor mixes wind from a dressed and decaled air cleaner with fuel from a carefully bent fluid line, and shoves it in to a correct, cast iron intake. Fire for that air/fuel mixture is provided by a traditional points distributor, which shoots spark around red, 430-4 branded valve covers via familiar Packard TV R Suppression cables. Spent gases from that air/fuel mixture are jetted through original, cast iron exhaust manifolds. At the front of the engine, pliable belts and hoses snake around factory power steering, a Delco-Remy alternator and a correct Frigidaire AC compressor.

Benefitting from a bevy of improvements in the several years that followed, this 1967 Buick Riviera has both of those qualities in absolute spades. It's as nice an example of the nameplate as you'll find - a truly stylish, numbers-matching, big displacement powerhouse that even comes complete with the factory build sheet to back up its authenticity.   ", "  With its lengthy hood, folding headlights and sweeping rear windshield, this Buick is the epitome of late 60's cool. For these second-generation Rivieras, Buick deleted the window vents, as it had done with great response back in the '30s, leaving a broad expanse of uninterrupted glass over the doors. It's a substantial car, but with its relatively low, level stance it looks convincingly agile, and its impressive condition really underscores its roadworthiness. The Arctic White exterior, the same shade it rolled off the Flint, Michigan assembly line with, is looking good and the black vinyl top remains unfaded by the elements.  The long expanse of chrome trim running down the center of the hood and the length of its sides are in fine form and the glass throughout is very clean. Sturdy as it was designed to be, the frame on which this Riviera sits remains unbowed by time, allowing the doors to show uniform gaps and to open and shut with ease.   ", "  The spacious interior, decked out in black vinyl, is every bit as comfortable as it looks. Both the buckets in front and the bench seat in back are in good shape, with no sagging and maintaining a deep hue. Centered between the buckets is a very stylish wood grained center console sporting a horseshoe shaped shifter. In front, the instrument cluster is a veritable museum piece, housing an assortment of gauges that sport a truly vintage look, including a rolling speedometer that displays its readings via a rotating cylinder that moves in lock step with increasing motoring speed.  Sitting above the cluster, the dash pad - which almost always bears the brunt of sun damage - remains crack-free and level. Take a look above you and you'll notice that the black headliner appears to have been recently replaced.   ", "  Underneath that long hood resides a beast of an engine, a freshly rebuilt 430ci V8. It's the original powerplant this car started its tour of duty with and it's no mere bloated placeholder - putting out in excess of 360hp and a monstrous 475 ft./lbs of torque. Considering the less powerful, big-displacement engine it replaced was capable of propelling the Riviera to sub-8 second 0-60 times, it's pretty easy to see why the 1967 incarnation of this second-generation was met with such enthusiasm. It's paired with a ST-400 3 speed automatic transmission so well-regarded that it remained GM's go-to transmission f"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1967 Buick Riviera ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "23995", "kilometers": 17073.099, "total_pages": 3, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/36024036", "brand": "Buick", "reference_id": "36024036", "year": "1967", "model": "Riviera", "specs": {"Engine": "430 CI V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "10,611 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Stock #": "2575-DFW", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Arctic White", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Arctic White"}},

It\u00c3\u00a2??s backed by a Super Turbine Automatic Transmission. You can clear everyone out of your way quick with the factory optional Trumpet Horns located under the hood. Everything has always been maintained mechanically; oil changes, tune-ups as needed, and the engine never really needed much attention. Who knows why only 2.05% of these received a Teal Mist paint finish from the factory because it is by far the best and looks absolutely stunning. It\u00c3\u00a2??s rolling on new Michelin tires wrapped around chrome wire wheel hubcaps. The drum brakes stop on a dime. It\u00c3\u00a2??s got new Bilstein shocks and grand sport springs, and stainless steel dual exhaust.

This classic GM personal luxury car is ready to take its new owner wherever he/she wants to go.Under the hood is where this Buick Riviera excites a car enthusiast. It's the standard 425 cubic inch engine, except this yellow brute has two four barrel carburetors and other assorted high-performance goodies right from the boys at Flint, MI. The \"Riv\" was truly the car that defined the growing \"personal luxury\" segment of the market.The current owner bought the car in 2014 right after the previous owner had the  transmission and driveline rebuilt. The current owner then had the engine rebuilt at a reputable shop here in the Phoenix area. The drivetrain has now been refurbished and should be reliable for the new owner for many thousands of miles.The rest of the car was deemed to be in excellent condition. The interior upholstery is believed to be original. The car's exterior color was originally yellow, although not this shade. All of the chrome is in good condition and the car presents itself well from all angles. It's got the hard-to-find components from the 465 HP package intact and the rest of the car is in excellent condition.Don't miss a chance to own a legendary performance car from Buick.
