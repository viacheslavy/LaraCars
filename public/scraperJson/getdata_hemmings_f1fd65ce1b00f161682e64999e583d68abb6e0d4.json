So when you can find one that was restored correctly, and still retains the important original components \u2013 like the high-compression 340 hp 327ci V8 \u2013 then you know you've found something quite special.", "Red Corvettes are so iconic that you might be asked to lead every 4th of July parade in this one.  But it takes more than just great legacy for a presentation this nice.  You can tell there was the right investment in the factory-correct color and the bodywork by the way it highlights the well-creased curves of the C1.  When the sunlight rolls over the glossy Roman Red, you get a deeper appreciation for the coves in the sides and flowing fenders.  Plus, it also showcases all the things we love about these later C1s, like the quad headlights, sleeker hood, and ducktail rear that ushered in the era of the C2's and the iconic four round taillights.  The Corvette had evolved into a much more serious machine by '62.  So while you still get those great wraparound chrome bumpers (recently restored to remain mirror-like,) the factory replaced its toothy grin up front with a blacked-out grille that wants to consume lesser roadsters.", "There's just something about a red convertible with a red interior that makes you want to always go for a drive \u2013 almost like a matador urging you to be bullish about the road ahead.  The carpeting, door panels, and bucket seats all retain a nice cherry hue. The dual cowl dash is the focal point inside, so it's always great to see it looking this nice.  But there's also function here, like the tachometer, which is great to have on a manual transmission car like this one.  And on those days when you don't want the open air experience, a color-matched hardtop and full roll-up windows give you the appeal of a coupe.", "All '62 Corvettes received the 327 cubic-inch V8, but not all were created equal.  RPO 396 meant a high-compression motor that was rated at an impressive 340 horsepower.  So we're especially excited to see this original high performance motor still in the engine bay.  The presentation under the hood looks terrific with the Corvette script on the valve silver covers, bright air topper, and bold block and intake color.  Plus, there has been a lot of expensive maintenance recently (engine servicing, rebuilt carb, exhaust system, etc.) There has even been the addition of an aluminum radiator, so this hot Corvette can remain running cool.  This one fires up easily as with terrific growl from the dual exhaust.  And the four-barrel carburetor and four-speed manual are the perfect duo of power and control for the open road.", "Corvette fans know this RPO 396 package is rare with less than 4,500 produced.  And as a truly special machine, you can tell from the condition of the body, V8, and undercarriage that there was real money invested in keeping this desirable C1 in top condition \u2013 the maintenance records, NCRS documentation, and owner's manual even come with the sale. So don't miss out, call today!"], "Exterior:": "Roman Red", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "58,764"}},

The 1962 Chevrolet Corvette closed the book on the first generation with some unique features, and now this one has a hot 327 small block.  So you know this is perfect all-American sports car to be respected everywhere and drive anywhere.", "You can choose to cruise two great ways with this classic Corvette.  First, put the white convertible top in place so it looks almost like a two-tone with the whitewall tires.  Or take it down so that way the world can see your ear-to-ear grin of driving one of the greatest icons around. These '62 cars look great in racecar red because they were the most aggressive of the bunch.  The front still has those great wraparound chrome bumpers but the toothy grin was replaced with a blacked-out grille that wants to consume lesser cars ahead.  In the back, this is the final year for the trunk, but the earlier tailfin versions were replaced with a streamlined ducktail (a precursor to the C2).", "The black interior gives this the ultimate classic color combo, which is fitting for the C1 \u2013 arguably the ultimate post-war classic.   And the red tonneau that dips in-between the bucket seats gives this a terrific splash of color.  The dual cowl dash is the focal point of the interior, so it's always great to see it looking this nice.  While the big speedometer is always attractive, we love seeing a functioning tachometer on a manual transmission car like this one.  The steering wheel has that great thin, grippy feel that only came on the right cars of this era.  Because you'll probably want to be cruising with the top down for as long as possible, it's always nice to know the heater is in good working order so you can still enjoy this roadster on a crisp fall Sunday drive.  And an upgraded AM/FM/cassette stereo with digital tuner was expertly added to increase your cruising pleasure.", "From the first glance, it's hard to see the upgrades in the motor.  The 327 cubic-inch small block is the correct displacement for '62, and this looks great with the mirror-like air topper and Corvette scrip valve covers.  But this V8 is borrowed from a '66 Corvette, which gives it the power rating closer to the high compression cars of '62.  And with the condition of the belt wires, and hoses, as well as the included maintenance records, you can tell this upgraded motor has been treated with respect.  The V8 inhales deeply through a four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority from the rumbling dual exhaust.  And the full fury and soundtrack of this enhanced V8 is in your hands thanks to the control of the four-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter.", "Strong, fast, and iconic, there's a reason why a final-year C1 all dressed in red is a dream car for many of us.  So if you want this classic Corvette to be yours, you're going to want to hurry and call now!"], "Exterior:": "Red", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "20,417"}},
