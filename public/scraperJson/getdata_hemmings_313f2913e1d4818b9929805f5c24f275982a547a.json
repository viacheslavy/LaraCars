Please take the time to view all 136 photos and video of this fine extremely rare fully loaded out Eldorado with heated seats!!!!!!  My website is www.supersportmotors.com.   I sell quite a few 67-70 Eldorado's because they are my favorite car of all time.  I purchased my first one in 1994 and in 1996 learned of just how rare a 67 Eldorado was with heated seats.  After searching for so long I began to believe there was no such thing.  20 years of searching later and here it is,  the most rare 67 Eldorado you will ever see.  Not only does it have the ever elusive heated seat option but it has every other option available that year except for the under dash tape player. Of all of the Eldorado's I have ever sold I've only had one other one that had the bucket seat option.  This car of course has that option as well.  It also has leather seats, front disc brakes ( which are in and of themselves almost impossible to find), climate control with working heat and A/C, cruise control, rear window defogger, electric eye that works, and everything else on the option list for that year that I provided a photo of.  The car presents just beautifully with the Atlantic blue firemist paint which was also a fairly rare option for this year.  For those of you who are searching for a 67 Eldorado and want something very very special.  This is that car!!!  If this car was in fact in perfect condition I would be asking well north of $60,000 for the car and it would sell for that.  There are a few things on the car that need attention but very little indeed.  The paint and interior are in extremely good condition and the engine runs great. A few options on the car do not work but the difficult things do work. The headlights covers which are always troublesome on these cars work great as well as the climate control.  Honestly I don't even know if the cruise control works or not.  The radio works and the antenna works intermittently.  Please call me at 315-853-1967 and I can talk with you about the car more in depth than I can with this short description.  It runs and drives great and with the black and blue color combination it commands attention everywhere I take her.  At the moment it sits in my garage parked right next to my personal black on black 67 Eldorado I have owned now for 9 years.  I will consider partial trades and welcome all pre-arranged visits to view and drive the car.  I love buying and selling these incredible cars as a hobby and love bringing cars like this to you.  My name is Michael Stanton and I am the proud owner of Super Sport Motors right here in Clinton NY 13323."], "Exterior:": "Atlantic Blue firemist", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "108000"}},

There are no signs of the car having ever been involved in any major accidents and it has absolutely no rust.The 1955 Cadillac was one of the highest priced cars of its day - and with good reason - fifties excess had virtually reached its peak with Cadillac boasting bigger cars with more chrome and larger fins than ever before! These cars bristled with the latest in modern appointments and had few rivals in the luxury market with a recession making owning one only for the very privileged elite.This particular southern California example has seemingly been always been garaged and well maintained. The floor boards, trunk and all the typical rust-prone areas are completely solid and rust-free and the car was a very highly optioned car for it's day boasting factory air conditioning which cost an additional $600 + alone (the equivalent of $5,500 in 2017 according to the CPI inflation calculator!), therefore making it a very rarely purchased option!The 331/250HP V8 engine is extremely strong and powerful and sounds absolutely magnificent and this particular car drives very well - does not miss a beat and purrs like a kitten - a truly remarkable daily driver that will give any modern day car a run for it's money! The transmission shifts smoothly through the gears and the car has four good white sidewall tires and its original factory hubcaps!This is a rare opportunity to own a very honest example of a 1955 Cadillac Coupe DeVille for the serious Cadillac enthusiast or collector.
