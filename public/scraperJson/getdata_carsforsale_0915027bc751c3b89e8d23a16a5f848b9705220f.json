It wasn't long ago when these were so inexpensive that they were practically disposable, but today the collector truck market has moved these wonderful pickups into the realm of genuine collectors' items.   ", "  First off, no truck in 1954 ever looked this good. The paint is a beautiful deep blue with great depth of the shine and the surface is almost too nice for commercial work. If you're looking for a truck that fits together well and hasn't been worked to death, this is it, and while the paint job is older and shows some signs of use, there's no denying this Chevy has a great look. The Advance Design pickups have that perfect blend of old school curves and rugged practicality, which perhaps shows best out back, where the lovely fenders are bolted to the bed, which, by the way, is lined with wood that has a wonderful patina, while the sides and tailgate are protected by color-matched spray-on bedliner material. The '54s got a new grille, which in this truck's case was color-matched to the bodywork, and the few pieces of chrome that are in place look great against the dark blue paint. It's not perfect, but it has a great look that suits an old pickup truck just fine.  ", "  The interior is simple, but with a cloth and suede seat cover, it's far more comfortable than the original vinyl.  A rubber mat was standard equipment, too, with simple door panels and lightly padded armrests, all framed by the steel door itself. The dash is nicely finished, with two large instrument pods holding the original gauges that are in great shape and fully operational. There's also an auxiliary tach under the dash. Seat belts and turn signals have been added for a bit of extra safety, and since this truck was built for the road, you'll surely appreciate them when you're out for a drive or heading up to the home center for supplies. There's also a working factory AM radio, which is rather a rare find, both because this is a pickup and, well, early AM radios rarely work. Nice, right?  ", "  This pickup carries the larger 235 cubic inch inline-six, which was rated at 105 horsepower and a very respectable 193 pounds of torque. This one is a little more potent thanks to a period Wayne dual carburetor setup with a matching set of exhaust headers. It was rebuilt about two years and 1500 miles ago, and there's a .040 overbore inside, an upgraded cam, and a 1958 head on top, all of which help build power that you can really use. An electronic ignition system lights it up and it's neatly dressed with a period finned aluminum valve cover, top and side. Underneath, it's clean and straight with no issues, and all the hardware is in great condition and ready to work or play, with the dual exhaust pipes exhaling into a single Flowmaster muffler for a great soundtrack. The 3-speed manual transmission shifts well, the rear gears are good for around-town driving and light highway "], "seller_name": " Message Seller", "title": "1954 Chevrolet 3100 ", "total_results": "", "price": "22995", "kilometers": 2461.77, "total_pages": 11, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27242110", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "27242110", "year": "1954", "model": "3100", "specs": {"Engine": "235 I6", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "1,530 miles", "Transmission": "3 Speed Manual", "Stock #": "2063-DFW", "Interior/Exterior": "Black & Gray / Dark Blue", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black & Gray / Dark Blue"}},

There was a time when any farm had one of these rusting away behind a barn or still working out in the fields, but today, they are highly sought collector's items. Hailing from a dry climate, this very solid pickup features a very correct restoration with some smart upgrades that make it a fine piece that you can show and drive with confidence.  ", "  Refinished in what I would certainly call Fathom Green, this truck looks highly authentic sitting on the blackwall tires with painted steel wheels and hubcaps. The Advance Design trucks debuted in 1948, the first post-war trucks to hit the market, and they were a huge success. The bodywork on this one has been well executed with good panel fit and alignment, and signs that a considerable amount of time was spent getting everything straight before the paint was sprayed. The finish is appropriate and looks great on this vintage hauler. The bed has been refinished with fresh oak planks and stainless steel strips and looks absolutely gorgeous. Up front, there's a painted grille, which was standard equipment on the 3100, and the chrome bumpers were options that were available from the dealer. A single tail lamp was also standard equipment, but this one sports a proper pair for highway safety in today's driving environment.  ", "  Utilitarian is the best way to describe the interior of the 3100. As I said, these were tools, not daily drivers, so while they are comfortable, they're also spartan, which is part of their charm. The brown bench seat sports a recent seat cover, the door panels are simple vinyl inserts, and the headliner is just basic fabric stretched over the steel body skin. The dash, however, is very similar to those in Chevy cars of the period, and there's a complete array of gauges keeping an eye on the Stovebolt under the hood. Painted a contrasting tan, the interior panels brighten the inside of the truck, and the chrome brightwork on the dash and glove box door really helps it feel more upscale. And yes, that's correct, this one sports a well-integrated Vintage Air A/C system and turn signals, making it a truck you can happily use every day.  ", "  If you do choose to use it daily, however, you'll have to content yourself with a leisurely pace. The 216 cubic inch inline-six under the hood is as tough and reliable as an anvil, but these trucks were never built for speed. The engine itself has been rebuilt, and bathed in the correct shade of gray with a minimum of ornamentation. The single barrel carburetor is topped by a compact oil bath air cleaner, and exhaust is handled by a single tailpipe that gives the truck its distinctive sound. Upgrades include the aforementioned A/C system as well as an alternator and an electric fan to keep it cool.

originality, custom touches, and rare features... and it's all available right now for a surprisingly affordable price.  ", "  We know why this truck grabbed you attention, and it's the same reason why it will grab everyone else's, too.  That matte black paint is a special treat. Some matte vehicles are lackluster (literally), but thanks to exceptionally clean and straight sheetmetal, the light rolls off the Advanced Deign pickup with the kind of uniformity that adds quality and a subtle shine.  The whole appearance defines aggressively elegant.  And speaking of aggression, the lowered suspension and whitewall tires on dogdish hubcaps is just great old school intimidation.  But the appeal of this pickup is more than just the custom touches.  It has all the right features that you love like the side mounted spare tire, and the dark wood side rails that match the lumber in the bed.  And there's nothing more desirable on these Chevys than the five-window cab design.  ", "  When you open the door and look at the bench seat, you realize the black paint with whitewalls that dominates the exterior styling is no accident.  The fresh two-tone bench gives this interior a uniform inside/outside appearance that really amplifies the atmosphere.  Beyond that are just the essentials that make owning a classic pickup a great experience. That classic Americana feeling is transmitted though your fingertips as you grab the steering wheel that was worn in by generations of workmen.  You get a warm feeling as you gaze over the original, painted steel dash and gauge package.  You get the addition of a tach, because a truck is all about function, and that lets you get the most out of the manual transmission.  ", "  Under the hood is a 235 cubic-inch inline six. This is the correct displacement for '54, and because it's part of the iconic Stovebolt/Blue Flame era, it has earned a reputation for being tough and reliable as an anvil.  While this is not an all-out speed machine, the cool four-speed manual transmission on the floor ensures you are in complete control of the powerband.  Besides, you don't buy a truck like this for all-out performance.  Sure, a small block fits easily in the engine bay, but your largest enjoyment is watching others see you ride around town in this alluring package.  And right now you get to do that with an intoxicating rhythmic chug that comes from true  vintage truck motoring.  ", "  Beautiful on the outside, nicely coordinated on the inside, and the right kind of old school under the hood \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is a pickup that's easy to love.  And with the prices these vintage Chevy 3100s are getting right now, you know this deal won't last long.
