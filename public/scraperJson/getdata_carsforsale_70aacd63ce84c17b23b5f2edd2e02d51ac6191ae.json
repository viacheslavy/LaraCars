With an upgraded 289 V8, four-on-the-floor, and the perfect shade of red, this is a fun cruiser that will serve you well for years to come.  ", "  Red Mustangs always instantly attract an audience, but this one does it a bit better.  Its unique shade is more vivid than even the factory's Signal Red.  It gives this coupe a sporty look that is continued with the hood pins, dual exhaust tips, and Shelby-inspired hood scoop.  And we know you've caught sight of the dual racing stripes.  These are truly running the full length of the car, and that's why you see it in places most others don't extend to, like below the grille and on the roof.  And because these painted stripes are clearcoated in with the red paint, you get a terrific even shine as the sunlight rolls over the whole body.  And speaking of shine, the chrome is bright, the stainless has been polished, and all the little trim pieces are in place, right down to the proper Mustang badges.  In fact, the only modern upgrade you'll notice immediately are the shining 17-inch alloys, but they're the kind of addition that just goes so well with this coupe's bright personality.  ", "  This special feeling continues inside.  After all, the black interior feels a bit like an extension of the exterior racing stripes.  The bucket seat interior now has a cup holder center console for added comfort.  Purist can remove this for a more factory appearance, but we love how it comfortably sets up the driver.  Your left hand rests comfortably on the thin and grippy factory three-spoke steering wheel, and your right one is immediately attracted to the Hurst shifter.  And while the radio has been upgrade to a retro-style AM/FM/cassette with digital tuner, we really know your favorite soundtrack will originate from under the hood.  ", "  The engine bay is an attraction all on its own with the bright air topper, fender braces, and Shelby-style Monte Carlo bar.  Plus, we all love the sight of Cobra valve covers.  And more than just look nice, this 289 cubic-inch V8 has been upgraded for performance with a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock aluminum intake, MSD coil, and long tube headers that feed the dual exhaust.  These upgrades are really going to allow you to enjoy the full control of the four-speed manual transmission to the fullest.  And that's what first-gen Mustang ownership is all about.  ", "  When you look at all the eye-catching features and great upgrades, you soon realize that this iconic coupe should cost a lot more.  That's why you know you need to hurry to grab this deal.

With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964 at the New York World's Fair.

With all of the factory Shelby touches, low production numbers, correct 289 V8, and solid restoration investment, this coupe would still be attractive at double the price.  ", "  The Shelby-like appearance of the California Special is no accident.  This was based on supercharged GT500 prototype coupe that didn't see the light of day.  That didn't stop California's Ford dealers for asking for a special package to heat up sales.  In fact, having it in Candyapple Red is the exact way you want this because the original prototype that inspired it was this color, too! The reason why the paint looks so spectacular today is it is a professional respray of the factory-correct color.  So the modern clearcoat really helps it pop in the sunshine.  All the correct California Special elements are still present, including the blacked-out grille, Lucas fog lamps, hood locks, Shelby-style rear scoops, pop off gas cap, and fiberglass tail with built-in spoiler.  Correct GT/CS stripes run down its flanks, and the taillights are 1965 Thunderbird units \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it's truly distinctive from every angle.  So this is a rare (less than 3,900 CS coupes were produced) package that will have you talking at all the car shows the moment you point out the genuine California Special badge on the rear fenders.  ", "  The code 2D red interior is another great mark of distinction. But the real reason why all of this looks so good is the carpets, headliner, door panels, and other elements that are not supposed to last a half-century have been replaced with correct new components.  You also get a few handy upgrades like the cup holder center console, and a retro-style AM/FM stereo that has a correct knob-style appearance but incorporates modern pieces like a digital tuner and aux input. The driver gets the great round gauge package that came on later versions of the first-gen Mustangs, and ahead of that is a Deluxe steering wheel with a stylized wood appearance in the center.  ", "  This is an original C-code car, and so you'll be happy to lift the hood and see the 289 cubic-inch V8 in the engine bay.  It has a bold presentation with its correct blue block, Powered by Ford valve covers, and correct air topper.  Even the details are right like the Ford hoses and clamps, because you make that kind of investment in a special Mustang like this one.  In fact, this coupe has less than 400 miles on it since restoration.  So it reliably fires up, and that makes you want to take this for a cruise at any time.  Plus, the three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, and modern Hankook tires on classic GT wheels make the driving experience an easy one.  ", "  This is an exceptionally rare California Special, and to help you tell its story, this coupe comes with a Marti Report.
