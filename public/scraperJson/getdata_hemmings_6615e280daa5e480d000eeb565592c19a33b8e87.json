Cars that look this good and are custom built for serious performance are rarely this affordable.  So dig in to all the details, but just know you're not the only one admiring this right now.", "The first generation of the 442 never looked better than in '69.   The wraparound chrome bumpers that cleanly integrate into the extra wide front and rear panels; the sporty silhouette of the hardtop design; the flying buttress rear pillars; and sheetmetal that has a sporty kick-up integrated into the rear fender.  This is '60s styling at its best, and you see it perfectly in a coupe treated correct where the doors still shut with authority.  But there's much more going on there than an iconic classic design.  The matte black paint instantly announces a more sinister machine.  And the gloss black on the hood draws attention to the huge power bulge.  Plus, a matching gloss black trunk and 15-inch American Racing wheels add to both the style and enhanced performance attitude.", "When you open the door, you're greeted by custom two-tone seating with a premium diamond pattern insert.  This setup is repeated on the door panels for a great custom appearance.  But while this one is luxurious like a good Olds should be, you also instantly know the coupe is on a pure performance mission.  After all, the roll cage, fire extinguisher, auxiliary gauge trio, and B&M shifter for the stout TH400 three-speed automatic transmission are the perfect accessories to be dragstrip ready.  And as you grab the wood and chrome sports steering wheel, it gives you a clear view at the huge AutoMeter SportComp tach with shift light.  That's a nice indicator that this is one serious coupe.", "Under the hood, you instantly recognize the signs of pure performance.  The big 455 cubic-inch V8 has all the right go-fast goodies, including a Holley four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock Torker 455 intake, MSD ignition, and Hooker long tube headers.  Plus, it has been fortified with the right supporting components, like an electric fuel pump, aluminum radiator, and an electric fan.  Not only does this have a ferocious growl out of the dual exhaust, but also when you really want them to hear you coming, there are cutouts so people can fear you by the sound alone.  A good street & strip machine also needs a good suspension, that's why you have a thick sway bar up front, upgraded rear, power steering, and power brakes with disc up front.", "An intimating appearance and ferociously fast coupe meets a terrific price.

This 1969 Boss 429 would be an impressive addition of any automobile collection.  It is quite another to own a touchstone to automotive history.  KK1649 was purchased new by Willard Kendig, inventor of the Kendig Variable Venturi Carburetor.  His son, Martin, recalls when his father jolted him out of bed at 1:00 a.m. excitedly explaining the new design to him.  ''He was on his way from Los Angeles to Visalia and he goes, 'Marty, I came up with an idea on a carburetor,' and he said, 'this damn thing is so simple, it's hard.'''", "Armed only with a metal blueprint, the Kendig carburetor was born.  Simple and efficient, by the early 1970's his design contributed many of Dyno Don Nicholson's drag racing wins.   It even dominated in speed the speed boat arena, winning the USA 1 competition.  Pollution Control Industries procured the Kendig Variable Venturi design and it evolved into the popularly known Predator carbs.", "A California car for virtually its entire life, this Boss 429 retains 100% of her original sheet metal and drivetrain.  Showing 64, 896 miles on the odometer, Willard drove this car and loved it.  Kendig drove the Boss 429 more than most, and understood it more than most as well, using it often to test new design ideas and performance tunes.  Legendary for elegant design solutions to sophisticated problems, people couldn't wait to see Kendig's latest and greatest creations.  What is more amazing, he was purely self-taught.  As his son, Martin, puts it, ''He just operated on a different plane of existence than the rest of us.''", "''He (Willard) tore down his first Model T at 12 years old,'' said Kendig's son Martin. ''And put it back together again. My grandpa almost beat him to death. It was their only means of automotive transportation and Dad dismantled it.''", "From the very beginning of his long career, he would often race against other speed part pioneers such as SEMA Hall of Fame members Ed Iskenderian and Phil Weiand.  This car remained in his possession until his passing in May of 2011.   The current owner purchased the car, not long after and completed a Concours restored in 2015, which currently shows 117 miles since built.", "Using all original or NOS parts where ever practicable, it is also one of the finest restorations you'll likely see.  The entire drivetrain is original, every single body panel is original & solid. The original engine tag, buck tag, multiple build sheets and original factory order invoice are all intact.
