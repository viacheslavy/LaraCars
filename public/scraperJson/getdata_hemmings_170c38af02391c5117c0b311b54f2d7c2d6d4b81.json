It also has the ''pony'' interior in light blue vinyl and white crinkle. In other words this classic Mustang looks very much like it did the day it sat on the Ford dealers showroom floor back in 66. Check out the equipment on this car though and you'll find power steering, power brakes, and even air conditioning. You'll also find a 289 V8 under the hood that is dressed up with some nice chrome accents, Shelby valve covers and air cleaner. In the still pictures of this car we have also provided pics of the underside of the car so take a good look at the floors and torque boxes. They look all original and in great shape, this car was originally delivered in Atlanta and must have spent much of it's time in the south. While you're looking at the underside pics take a look at the front and rear suspension, looks like new bushings, shocks, etc. and it shows when you're driving down the highway. All in all this is a quite nice driver quality car that looks very original and  has had some upkeep down as well as upgrades. The paint does show it's age some with checking, chips and blemishes but is still presentable.
