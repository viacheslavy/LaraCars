Only available on 1965 cars, this is an attractive way to stand out.  There has been an investment in a professional respray that gives this one an added depth when the sunlight hits the modern application.  Bodywork is excellent with straight panels and good alignment throughout, which means you can shut the doors with confidence every time.  The brightwork is complete and straight on everything from the mirror-like chrome bumpers to the iconic 289 badges.  And you can really tell this is a first-class pony car by more than just its interesting paint and trim.  The styled steel wheels and are white vinyl roof are part of a total package that announces its premium presence while remaining period-correct.", "There's even more period-correct distinction when you open the door. It starts with the factory-correct blue crinkle vinyl seats.  They coordinate nicely with the side panels, carpeting, dash, and even the exterior paint to give this coupe the appeal of a deep blue ocean.  You get all the great iconic features like the bucket seats, dual cowl dash, and the three-spoke sports steering wheel with pony logo center cap.  But then there are also nice subtle upgrades like the retrosound radio that keeps the classic knob-style appearance while upgrading you to a digital AM/FM tuner with cassette player.  But from the moment you spot the rare Rally-Pac and rest your right hand on the chrome gearshift, you begin to realize how special this '65 Mustang really is.", "As much as you'll love the interior and exterior, it's the rare K-code HiPo 289 cubic-inch V8 under the hood that will impress even the most seasoned Mustang enthusiast.  It's Ford's racing motor that took home the trophies around the globe, and so it's fantastic to have the original numbers-matching powerplant still living in this engine bay.  It has the right amount of flash on the air topper and valve covers that also proudly announce its high performance heritage.  But more importantly, you can see that everything has been maintained correctly on this significant motor \u2013 from the belts & hoses, to the correct decals in the engine bay. With the turn of the key, the dual exhaust gives a high octane V8 symphony, and the four-speed manual transmission makes you its conductor.  The Ford nine-inch rear end has versatile 3.50 gears to give it plenty of punch around town but still cruises reasonably at highway speeds. Plus, the thick sway bar up front is great for handling, and the wide set of BF Goodrich T/As keeps plenty of rubber on the road to truly enjoy this rare performance pony.", "There were only 7,273 K-Code '65 Mustangs ever made.  Just think about how many have been harvested or abused over the last half-century, and then you realize what a treasure a complete and cared for car this coupe really is.

Take this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible just about anywhere this side of a Super Chevy show, and it'll find a large group of enthusiastic admirers and the new owner will quickly discover that everyone is your friend when you drive a drop-top pony car.", "The bright red paint looks right on the tidy, trim first-generation Mustang shape. While this one was originally Silver Blue, there's no sign of it anywhere, inside or out, suggesting a full disassembly during the restoration and the results were worth it. The finish highlights the car's important parts such as the crease along the tops of the fenders and the famous ''C-scoop'' on the flanks. Fit and finish are pretty darned good for a car that's built to cruise, and you can see even at a distance that the doors and hood fit quite well. The two-stage urethane finish has a decent shine that shows a few swirls and polishing marks, but with a professional buff, this car will sparkle on the show field. Nice chrome bumpers were surely replaced during the cosmetic stages of the restoration and while it packs a V8, it doesn't advertise beyond the usual '289' badges and twin exhaust pipes out back.", "The black interior is correct and replaces the original code 22 Blue upholstery, so you know it has been restored. Handsome bucket seats flank a nicely restored center console, giving this bright ragtop a very upscale look. The '65s still used the wide central speedometer with outer pods for fuel level and temperature, and we're guessing that the instrument panel is original albeit in good shape. A matching black steering wheel works rather well in the monochromatic interior and there's an AM radio head unit in the dash that's probably due for an upgrade for cruising this summer. The dash pad, carpets, and door panels are all in excellent condition and there's a very nicely done white convertible top that folds flush and disappears under a matching black boot. The trunk is also correctly finished with a new reproduction mat and full-sized spare tire assembly.", "Experts will already have glanced at the VIN and noticed that this is a C-code car, meaning a 289 cubic inch V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor and 200 horsepower. You're in luck, because that's what's in there today. Looking quite tidy under the hood, it brings a fat torque curve to the game which makes this Mustang far more entertaining to drive. With chrome valve covers and a matching air cleaner, it has a neo-GT look and those fender braces do make a noticeable improvement in front-end stiffness. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic transmission and an 8-inch rear end which are rugged enough to handle the V8's horsepower, and the car has been fitted with power steering that makes it very easy to handle. The underside of the car is remarkably clean and there's a new gas tank and a recent dual exhaust system hanging out back. It rolls on optional styled steel wheels and they're wrapped in fat 195/75/14 whitewall radials.", "Affordable fun in the sun, that's the Mustang.

It is a calming, soothing, color that catches the light nicely in a way that highlights the crisp clean body lines of the car.  There is white GT stripe low on the car between the wheels that really complements the classic white convertible roof when it is up, or the white boot cover when the roof is down.    The bumpers, as well as various other chrome and polished brightwork pieces, add a tasteful splash of flash to this car.  Of course, there is large running Mustang front and center on the grill.  The front fenders have 2 more smaller ponies backed by red, white, and blue stripes, and 289 badging announcing what is under the hood.  The clean lines of the back of the car are finished off with chrome exhaust tips, and the whole package sits on chrome Magnum wheels with Mustang center caps.", "The white roof is classy and really looks great when it's up, but getting in and hitting the button to drop the top brings the sky and your surroundings in. The blue interior of this car really compliments the paint color.  Door panels that are pleated match the seats for a complimentary look.  A sculpted, stock dash looks great and helps keep the gauges shaded from the sun, especially while top down motoring.  The stock radio is even still in place and has a cool Mustang graphic running across the face of it. Settle into the bucket seat, and feel that 3 spoke black and chrome steering wheel in your hand.  Hit the key and reach for the floor shifter to get this car in gear and get it rolling.  Enjoy an escape ride for yourself, because convertibles are good for that, or load up your friends and head out for some fun, because top down motoring is fun no matter how you do it.", "The sweet 289 cubic inch engine in this car is just what the doctor ordered.  And it's also the way it was originally ordered.  This engine makes great power and wants to run, revving freely when you ask it to.  There are a few nice touches like gold valve covers and master cylinder cap along with a polished air filter housing dressing up the engine bay.  The power it makes flows back through a 4-speed transmission letting you pick the gear you want to be in for cruising, and a leaf spring rear end gets the power transferred to the ground.   Front disc brakes provide great stopping power to reign in those ponies as needed, and steering control comes from a control arms suspension with coils springs and a sway bar to keep the front end planted on twisty back roads.  The 215/75R14 tires front and rear work well and the whole package is balanced making this car a joy to drive.", "Settle into the seat, and take a spin.

This one is a real-deal GT and has all the proper hardware to back it up. Painted in 2013, the spectacular black finish is holding up superbly. Sure, it shows a few extremely minor signs of use because nobody can resist the siren song of a V8 pony car in the garage, but this is the kind of car that makes men and women, young and old look appreciatively as it drives by. You'll park it in parking lots and walk away backwards to admire it as you go. Fit and finish are excellent with doors that don't sag and decent gaps all around that closely approximate how the factory did it. It shines up nicely so you'll enjoy waxing it almost as much as driving it, and with red GT stripes running along the rockers, everyone will know this isn't a garden-variety pony. It has also been recently treated to a Sapphire ceramic coating, so it should look this good for years to come. Other GT features include the twin fog lamps in the grille area, shiny chrome exhaust trumpets poking through the rear valence, and, of course, the GT gas cap, all of which give it a slightly more aggressive look than your standard Mustang.", "The red Pony interior was obviously restored not too long ago and you'll find it's easy to get comfortable behind the wheel, like seeing an old friend. The handsome color combination is a nice complement to the shiny black paint, an elegant two-tone look that makes the Mustang feel more expensive than it is. It's fitted with desirable options like a center console and Rally-Pac clock/tachometer on the steering column, plus the interior d\u00e9cor group that includes a wood-rimmed steering wheel and dash panels. The only noteworthy upgrade is an AM/FM stereo in the dash that expands your entertainment options beyond the original AM setup. The original gauges show very good faces and clear lenses, and they all seem to be working the way they should. Overhead, there's a recent white power convertible top that uses a red boot to give the car a trim look, top up or top down.

It also includes a big aluminum radiator, a Monte Carlo bar, as well as front disc brakes that were part of the GT package. The ''Toploader'' 4-speed manual transmission shifts cleanly and powers an 8-inch rear with 3.00 gears inside, making this a nice car to drive around town or on the highway.

Features power brakes, fog lights, wood steering wheel, new floor mats, period correct trunk liner, a new spare tire with jack, and an aftermarket AM/FM radio. It comes with the engine rebuild receipt, appraisal report and original radio.The iconic pony car lives on! The success of the first year and a half of the famed muscle car drew a pretty big crowd from the beginning and that continued on into 1966. During that year the 1 Millionth Mustang was sold. This feat was achieved in only 18 months from the time the first Mustang rolled off the assembly line. This particular 1965 Mustang has undergone a complete restoration. The black vinyl top of this car is nearly flawless and the car itself just flows like a Mustang should. The interior is in immaculate condition. The 289ci engine had been a staple for Ford at the time and really captured the power that has always been talked about with the Ford Mustang. The Wimbledon White shines and draws your attention to the fine lines and details of the body, all the way from the chrome front bumper to the taillights. The 1965 Ford Mustang is a worthy car to show off in any capacity.

If you've been waiting for the right one to show up, here it is.", "Ford offered three reds in 1965, and this looks to be Poppy Red, although it's tough to make out the letter on the original door tag. Regardless, this is probably the car most folks imagine when you say ''1965 Mustang convertible'' and there's no shame in being America's favorite ragtop. The clean, straightforward lines of the 1965 Mustang always look best in bright red, making it look as quick and agile as it actually is. The finish has some age on it, but is holding up well; besides, who can blame the owner for driving and enjoying the car? It's still a great cruiser that will draw an appreciative crowd at the local cruise night and the tidy bodywork gives away nothing to the newer cars. The paint is in good order, showing a bright shine and very straight sheetmetal underneath, and the usual trouble-spots are in great shape; just note how well the trunk fits, the clean quarters, and the tight headlight surrounds. There's nice chrome, including the 1965 grille with cross bars and both bumpers, as well as all the correct emblems and badges. It's still the ultimate summer time fun machine and this one matches that description perfectly: comfortable, casual, and ready to have fun.", "The interior is the correct code 29 Palomino vinyl, which was Ford's way of saying ''beige.'' It offers a great look with the bright red bodywork and if you're going to be driving around with the top down, light colors are always welcome. The workmanship is very well done and the seat covers fit snugly, the carpets are in good order, and the door panels match the seats quite well. It's got the standard instrument panel, which includes all the major functions in two large pods flanking the wide speedometer, and the markings are clear. A modern AM/FM/cassette radio is in the dash and we're pleased to say that everything works properly on this car, suggesting that it's led a very easy life. The white power vinyl top uses a crystal clear plastic rear window and stows under a matching Palomino tan boot that gives it a very trim look. The trunk has been treated to a new mat along with a full-sized spare and matching cover. Someone's clearly been spending money on this one.", "There's no way to determine matching numbers in an early Mustang, but there's no doubt that it's the right engine: Ford's torquey and tough 289 cubic inch V8. It was recently detailed and looks fantastic, including the Ford Blue paint, bright chrome dress-up kit, and nice satin black inner fenders with no signs of neglect. There's a 2-barrel carburetor under the air cleaner today, although this is a factory A-code car, so adding a 4-barrel for more performance isn't going to be a demerit. It also includes power steering, which is always welcome, even in the lightweight Mustang. The C4 3-speed automatic transmission is the perfect companion to the easy-cruising 2-barrel 289 and it has a robust feeling that encourages you to have fun. Underneath you'll find all the factory convertible reinforcements are in place and in good order and with 3.00 gears out back, it's a great candidate for road trips. Beautiful styled steel wheels are the right choice and they carry 205/75/14 whitewall radials for an authentic look.", "This awesome Mustang is ideal for cruising and will draw a crowd everywhere it goes.

The body is straight down the sides and has a great fit of the doors, hood, and trunk.  Everything is covered in the Signal Flare Red color scheme that's accented by the Black Vinyl Top and Black Side Stripe.   The paint has been buffed and polished to a gorgeous shine.  All the trim and stainless is very nice with a lot of appearing to have been replaced at the time of the restoration.  You'll notice all the glass is also in great condition with the side glass going up and down as it should.

On the inside it's done in the Parchment Crinkle vinyl and has the Palomino Accents with the Pony Interior package.  The seat covers are all in great condition and appear to have been replaced at the time of the restoration.  It does have bucket seats and console that runs up to the A/C unit and houses the Automatic Shifter.  Looking at the dash you will see it has the wood grain trim to match the console and that is also has the Woodgrain Steering Wheel.  In the trunk all appears to be solid and has the trunk mat.", "Finally, we will get to the driveline of the Ford.  Under the hood it features what we believe is the original 289 Engine.
