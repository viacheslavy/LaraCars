The fact that they're also great-looking is merely icing on the cake. V8 power, brilliant bright red paint, and a stock-style interior make this big Belvedere a car that's good at just about everything.  ", "  You can't miss this much sheetmetal painted bright red, and like the period race cars that shared its bodywork, this Belvedere is all about getting attention. The full-sized Belvedere offers ideal proportions and that awesome cantilevered roofline that made the recognizable from a mile away. Although it was designed to be affordable, that doesn't mean the guys at Plymouth skimped on the shiny stuff, either, giving it bright side trim, chrome bumpers, and a simple grille up front that would totally fill other cars' rear-view mirrors with Mopar. The bright red paint works well behind the shiny stuff, giving this big cruiser a high performance look that speaks to its dual nature. Fit and finish are quite good, with doors that close easily and a massive trunk lid that fits well, and believe me, getting a piece of metal that big to look good is no easy task. All the original badges and emblems were reinstalled after the paint was dry, and for the most part, this car looks like it might have in 1967 after being enjoyed for a few years.  ", "  Funky red brocade cloth upholstery works well with the bright red paint job and the replacement seat covers accurately duplicate the originals. Matching door panels continue the simple-but-elegant theme and pleats everywhere are part of the 1960s vibe that defines this car. The steering wheel is a beautiful study in simplicity and the symmetry of the dash is pretty cool, with the pushbutton transmission controls on the left and heater controls on the right. Stock instruments offer a fairly comprehensive view of the engine's condition and aftermarket A/C was added discreetly under the dash. The original AM radio is still in the dash, a nice nod to originality, and remarkably it still works! The trunk is positively huge by today's standards a new trunk mat and spatter paint that shows off more clean sheetmetal.   ", "  Getting all that sheetmetal moving is the job of a 318 cubic inch V8. With an intake obviously designed to make torque, a 2-barrel carburetor, and a rumbling dual exhaust, it delivers the kind of low-end grunt that makes these cars so much fun to drive. With Hemi Orange paint on the block, it looks fairly authentic, a look that's enhanced by the simple stamped valve covers and factory air cleaner assembly. Someone spent a good deal of time on the inner fenders and firewall before the paint went on, so popping the hood is a pleasure. A 727 TorqueFlite 3-speed automatic is robust enough to handle the power, and there's an 8.75-inch rear end out back. There's a brand new dual exhaust system underneath that sounds mellow but not loud and it looks"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1964 Plymouth Belvedere ", "total_results": "785 .

The Barracuda (particularly the 1970-74 E-Body cars) is a collectible car today, with the high-performance versions and convertibles commanding the highest prices. The small number of Barracudas remaining in existence is the result of low production/sales when the vehicles were new.

This Lilac colored GTX is powered by a 440 Big Block mated to a Hurst 4-Speed manual transmission and backed by a Dana rear end housing 4.10 Posi-Trac gears.  Fuel is supplied by a 750 Double Pumper.  The camshaft has a nice lump to it thanks to the utilization of a Purple Cam camshaft with .509 lift and 292 duration.  An Air Grabber hood feeds cool air into the engine and a Mopar Performance electronic ignition adds a hot spark for extra ponies.  This GTX started life out as a \"U\" code car (440/375 horsepower).  The original is long gone as many are and in place is a date coded replacement.  The Lilac paint is a big attention grabber and is nicely complimented by a black vinyl roof and American Racing wheels.  Inside is a standard black vinyl interior with a split bench seat, shoulder belts and an auxiliary tachometer mounted to the steering column.  When you pull up in a GTX, everyone will know that your car means business.  The GTX was the top of the line muscle car from Plymouth and was step up from the Road Runner.  This one is titled as a Plymouth Satellite but decodes as a GTX.  For more information on this 1970 Plymouth GTX, call 618-271-3000 or swing by our St. Louis showroom.

With all the advances in horsepower we've enjoyed over the past four decades, there's still nothing like the swell of torque from a well-tuned big block and in the lightweight, stripped-down, street fighter Roadrunner, the effect is thrilling every time you step on the gas.  ", "  There's something to be said for subtlety, although we're not sure if a car with a giant hood scoop on a flat black hood is exactly low-profile. On the other hand, the handsome silver paint isn't flashy, but it's kind of a stealth look that helps stay out of sight when there's this much horsepower involved. The sheetmetal underneath is in good order, with decent gaps and lots of effort spent on getting those massive quarters straight without blunting the wonderful character line that sweeps across the surface. It's fairly recent and shines up well, and you could really take it up a notch with a professional cut and buff. Silver fits right in today and we like the contrast of the modern(ish) color on the vintage sheetmetal; it's sophisticated and unusual and we especially like it without graphics or stripes, which was surely the original owner's intention. Nice chrome bumpers, a few shiny trim bits, and no graphics or stripes all help with the upscale look that comes at a reasonable price.  ", "  The all-business interior is nicely finished and uses correct materials and patterns to replicate that late-60s vibe. The Roadrunner was no-frills, of course, but you could get buckets and a console, and the detailing on the door panels and the modestly convincing woodgrained steering wheel help dress things up a bit. The gauges are probably original and show clear lenses and bright markings, and they're joined by a big tach strapped to the steering column. Obviously with the 4-speed manual, this car was built for combat, so there's no radio, although it's ripe for the aftermarket head unit of your choice. There is a pistol-grip shifter, which is always cool, but this car is strictly business. In fact, on a car that was practically advertised by the factory as a blank canvas for modifications, this 'Beeper is shockingly stock inside and out. The trunk is as massive as you'd expect, and all the sheetmetal remains in fantastic condition.  ", "  The freshly built 440 cubic inch big block delivers the kind of creamy-smooth torque that only lots of displacement can offer. It's based on a stock 440 block that's been filled with 10.7:1 compression Keith Black pistons, Mopar Six Pack rods, stainless fads, Comp Cams camshaft, and roller rockers up top. Intake duties come from an Edelbrock Ram intake with a Holley double-pumper carb and it's lit up with an MSD spark box. Nicely finished in Hemi Orange paint, the big V8 never feels like it's working very hard but things happen in a big hurry when you bury the loud pedal.
