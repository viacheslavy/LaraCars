Often, the Sports Sprint package came on Mustangs ordered in special or spring-like colors. Ford referred to it as a limited edition and included it as part of the car's third birthday celebration.", "Finished in Brittany Blue Metallic with a white accent stripe, this car's paint and trim are in overall excellent order.

The tires are in very good order while the wheels are in excellent condition.", "Under the hood is Ford's 289 CID V-8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor that breathes through twin-tip dual exhausts and backed up by Ford's C-4 SelectShift three-speed automatic transmission and a 2.79:1 differential.

The front buckets and rear bench are in excellent condition, as is the Parchment carpet and headliner. The color-keyed three-spoke steering wheel looks great while the instrument panel, with its fully array of instrumentation and woodgrain appliqu\u00e9s and brown accents harmonizes well with the rest of the interior's theme. The inner door panel echo the majority of the interior's condition though the right one has a small blemish. The center and overhead consoles, the latter equipped with map lights, are in great shape, as is the shift lever. Completing the interior is a factory AM radio.", "The 1967 model year Mustang was the first redesign of the original model. Ford's designers began drawing up a larger version even as the original was achieving sales success, and while \u201cIacocca later complained about the Mustang's growth, he did oversee the redesign for 1967.\u201d The major mechanical feature was to allow the installation of a big-block V-8 engine. The overall size, interior and cargo space were increased. Exterior trim changes included concave taillights, side scoop and usual yearly wheel and gas cap changes.", "The 1967 Deluxe Interior was revised, discontinuing the embossed running horse motif on the seat backs (the source for the \u201cpony interior\u201d nickname) in favor of a new deluxe interior package, which included special color options, brushed aluminum (from August 1966 production) or woodgrain dash trim, seat buttons and special door panels. The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965-66 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome quarter trim caps, carried over from 1965-66. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird.", "The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965-66, became optional and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded and unique center and overhead consoles were options. Gone was the Rally-Pac since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the installation of the accessory atop the steering column. The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.", "Documentation includes a standard Marti Report, outlining many of the car's originating facts and equipment.", "Competition to this Mustang in 1967 included the other members of the 1960s Ponycar Corral, Chevrolet's Camaro, Dodge's Dart, Mercury's Cougar, Plymouth's Barracuda and Pontiac's Firebird.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri.

The car's lights are clear and haze-free, including the LED taillights and the fog lights nestled below the grille.", "The car's bodywork is straight and solid, the engine bay is exceedingly tidy, the battery appears new and the car's bumpers fit well to the body. This stallion rolls on Nitro radials, 225/40ZR18 at all four corners. Each tire surrounds an American Racing polished aluminum wheel. The tires and wheels are in excellent condition.", "Under that hood with a power bulge is a 289 CID V-8 High-Performance Cobra engine that was comprehensively restored and has an Edelbrock Power Package, aluminum heads and headers, a Flaming River rack-and-pinion steering conversation and upgraded suspension. The engine breathes via dual side exit exhausts. Mated to the engine is a C-4 three-speed automatic transmission.

These cars are known as \u201clate 65's.\u201d The engine lineup was changed, with a 200 CID \u201cT-code\u201d engine. Next up the ladder was a \u201cC-code\u201d 289 CID engine with a two-barrel carburetor as the base V-8. An \u201cA-code\u201d four-barrel carbureted version was next in line, followed by the unchanged \u201cHi-Po\u201d \u201cK-code\u201d 271 hp 289. The DC electrical generator was replaced by a new AC alternator on all Fords (a way to distinguish a 1964 from a 1965 is to see if the alternator light on the dash says \u201cGEN\u201d or \u201cALT\u201d). The Mustang GT version was introduced as the \u201cGT Equipment Package\u201d and included a V-8 engine (most often the 225 hp (289), grille-mounted fog lamps, rocker panel stripes, and disc brakes.", "In the interior, the GT option added a different instrument panel that included a speedometer, fuel gauge, temp. gauge, oil pressure gauge and ammeter in five round dials (the gauges were not marked with numbers, however.) A four-barrel carbureted engine was now available with any body style. Additionally, reverse lights were an option added to the car from August 1964 production. The Mustang was originally available as either a hardtop or convertible, but during the car's early design phases a fastback model was strongly considered. In 1965, the Shelby Mustang was born, it was available only in newly introduced fastback body version with its swept-back rear glass and distinctive ventilation louvers.", "The standard interior features of the 1965 Mustang included adjustable driver and passenger bucket seats, an AM radio, and a floor mounted shifter in a variety of color options. Ford added additional interior options during the 1965 model year. The Interior Decor Group was popularly known as \u201cPony Interior\u201d due to the addition of embossed running ponies on the seat fronts, and also included integral armrests, woodgrain appliqu\u00e9 accents and a round gauge cluster that would replace the standard Falcon instrumentation. Also available were sun visors, a (mechanical) remote-operated mirror, a floor console, and a bench seat. Ford later offered an under-dash air-conditioning unit, and discontinued the vinyl with cloth insert seat option, offered only in early 1965 models. One option designed strictly for fun was the Rally-Pac. Introduced in 1963 after Ford's success at that year's Monte Carlo Rally and available on other Ford and Mercury compacts and intermediates, the Rally-Pac was a combination clock and tachometer mounted to the steering column. A 14\u2033 rim option was available for Rally-Pac and GT350R vehicles widening front and rear track to 57.5\u201d. A compass, rear seat belts, A/C and back-up lights were also optional.", "Competition to this car in 1965 included Dodge's Dart and Plymouth's Barracuda.", "This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Current mileage on the odometer shows 159 miles and is understood to be miles since restoration. It is sold as is, where is, on a clean and clear, mileage exempt title.

This car is riding on 4 beautiful chrome wheels that are free of curb rash or any other damage.  The BF Goodrich are deep in rubber and have plenty of miles left on them.
