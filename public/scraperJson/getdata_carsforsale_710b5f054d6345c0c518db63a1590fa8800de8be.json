Original panel rust free car. This mustang started as a 6 cylinder 3 speed car (I have the original 3 speed transmission if you want it). It came out of Arizona in 1987 and has had the same owner since we purchased it locally last year. It was repainted in the late 80s singe stage poppy red.  Original paint was J code Rangoon red (have the bill for the paint job) 15 inch aluminum wheels, good tires. It has its original sheet metal panels.  Only panel that has been replaced was the drivers door (had dent when purchased in 1987). ", "car does have dents/dings, chips and surface scratches (a lot of chips had been touched up) and stained surface paint but remember its basically all paint from the late 80s. All body gaps are all nice, doors and windows open and shut great. The floor, trunk, cowl, shock towers, door jams lower doors and sheet metal are rust free. It has never had any rust repairs. has underside surface rust (only rust through is below the gas pedal on floor seam (right where the drivers foot rested when driving, very small) and two spots on right lower door which are just little pinholes).  Its been a long long time since I have seen one this original and nice. The paint has a nice shine and looks good from 25 feet.

The blinker switch is not on the column (missing)  but it has a switch on lower dash for blinkers. rear back up lights don't work. windshield has a chip. This is a car you can drive as is or restore it down the road.", "Since we purchased this mustang we have redone the brakes. We added new carpet, dash pad, door panels just to freshen up the interior to make it a nicer driver.  We also cleaned and buffed the entire car. I have a one inch full folder of prior receipts dating back to 1987. It will probably will need a new gas tank.", " Miles 86,213 are thought to be actual, but are marked exempt on the title.

If you like the idea of having an old hauler around for fun and maybe a few projects on the side, this Ford is a really good choice.  ", "  When you think of an old Ford pickup, in your imagination it's either hunter green or bright red, and this red one has a great old-time look that is instantly identifiable. With not a lot of miles on the build, it's in good order, although it's not perfect so it has a lot of personality that is part of why old trucks are perennially popular. The red paint is nicely done and has an awesome shine, not perfect, but just about right for a hauler that's designed to work for a living. Panel fit is quite good, with the hood and doors fitting properly and nice running boards that don't look like they've been rusty or beaten up over the past six decades. Chrome trim, such as the unique trim on the hose and Ford F-100 emblems on the side, while simple chrome bumpers give it a finished look. Maple planks in the bed look great and have a slightly rustic look that works well, and the hard maple is tough enough that you won't have to worry about actually hauling stuff back there.  ", "  The tan bench seat is a jaunty change of pace from all the black interiors you see in trucks and defines this truck perfectly: it's fun and not at all serious. The original seat frame is underneath and tilts forward for a little access in back. Rubber floor coverings were stock, but it how has carpets and plush door panels that make this pickup feel anything but basic. The standard instrument panel still lives in the dash, joined by a set of auxiliary dials underneath, largely needed because of the 12-volt upgrade. You'll find an accessory heater under the dash on the passenger's side, and someone has thoughtfully added a custom A/C system that's just a quick recharge away from summertime cruising. And while you can't see it, there's also an AM/FM/CD stereo system so this one is a joy to drive.  ", "  While the V8s got all the attention, Ford also offered a 215 cubic inch inline-6 that was nearly as powerful as the venerable flathead. Smooth and torquey, the slick six gives this pickup great road manners and plenty of pep, and it'll definitely attract attention at shows when you pop the hood. A 12-volt alternator ensures reliability and allows the use of a modern electronic ignition system, not to mention the modern A/C. There are a few chrome-plated parts to dress things up but for the most part it's pretty stock. It's backed by a 3-speed manual gearbox and the original rear end, so it's happy cruising at 55 MPH, the twin tailpipe burbling away behind you. It's quite clean underneath and the simplicity is a refreshing change, perfect for the guy who just wants an old pickup without the hassles. Simple steel wheels with trim rings and hubcaps look great and are fit"], "title": "1954 Ford F-100 ", "total_results": "10640", "price": "24995", "kilometers": 107175.49, "total_pages": 445, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29663929", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "29663929", "year": "1954", "model": "F-100", "specs": {"Engine": "6 Cylinder", "Mileage": "66,610 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "3 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Tan", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
