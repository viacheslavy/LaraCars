This driver comes out of an estate and collection of fine automobiles.  The in-house mechanic states that the engine and transmission have been rebuilt and the brakes are in good working order.  Newer paint was applied and the vehicle shows well.  The floors and undercarriage plus the inside of the fenders have been undercoated.   A roll bar has been installed.  The windshield glass on the driver's side has a crack and will need replacement.  Some paint bubbling was noticed also on the windshield frame.  This is a no-nonsense little cruiser.  Perfect for running around town, as a grocery-getter, a vehicle for advertising, parades or simply to show and enjoy.  The vehicle is currently on display at the Murphy Automobile Museum in Oxnard, California.", "For additional information please phone Dave Henry at 805 705-4924."]}},
