It's an elegant, powerful, comfortable, timeless, and nimble classic that's presented in a great factory color combo, and has the right late-model upgrades.", "Anthracite Gray Metallic is a very special color.  In your garage or at night it will have a look of a gunmetal hue, which is very popular today.  But once the sunlight hits it, the metallic undertones really come to life and give this paint a cosmic charisma. Oh yeah, the Germans understand how to engineer a deep and rich paintjob. But it takes more than precision engineering for a factory paint to retain this much shine 30 years later.  This is a two-owner car, and it has spent nearly that full time under the first owner's care.  You can tell it was his baby by the way the body has remained looking crisp, the straightness of the pinstripes, and how the factory wheels remain mirror-like.  It's the exact kind of presentation you want when you're looking for a cut-above classic convertible.  And that's what a good R107 series Mercedes SL is all about.  This was one of the few well-built convertibles of the era, and so it was the go-to driver for celebrities, dignitaries, and the wealthy.  The sleek lines hid a full size interior and usable trunk that was perfect for any road trip.", "The Palomino tan leather interior is the perfect color to contrast the exterior gray while still complementing it.  And this car was meant to look great with the top down, because it's a real driver's grand touring machine.  The dual bucket seats are in great condition and offer a level of all-day comfort that is unmatched in some new convertibles for twice this price.  The 560SL was one of the most expensive cars Mercedes offered during its reign, so the features list is quite long.  This includes desirable conveniences such as power windows, power steering, cruise control, and now an upgraded AM/FM/CD stereo.  Because this was built 1988 there are also more modern features than most R107s, such as a third brake light, driver's airbag, and anti-lock brakes.  It comes with both the folding soft top and a removable hardtop that matches the special exterior paint.  But we know you really want this car for top down fun, and so the air conditioning has been converted to modern R134a to keep you cool while looking cool.", "The cleanliness of the engine bay is another great reminder of how well this Mercedes has been treated all its life.  The 560SL is one of the most desirable luxury sportscars of the era because of the power under the hood.  The 5.6-liter V8 was the largest displacement offered, and it was the perfect mix of durability, smoothness, and power.  Plus, when mated to a four-speed automatic transmission with highway-friendly overdrive, this is the vintage Benz that's still a great weekend getaway machine.  But more than just the interstates, this one has a fully independent suspension and four-wheel disc brakes to keep you looking for the back roads.", "Complete with owner's manual packet, no other car combines grand touring comfort in a powerful and nimble machine so perfectly.  So when you can find an exceptional example in the best color combo, you know you need to act fast to take it home.

The mileage on this car is exceptionally low at 65,313 miles.  The current lady owner is the second owner and pride of ownership is evident.  The car received a professional repaint some time in the past and the finish remains in overall excellent condition with some minor flaws. Sheepskin seat covers were purchased to protect the leather.  The dash shows virtually as-new while many of these cars have scratches and cracks due to age and the environment.  A aftermarket stereo is installed.  The condition of the convertible soft top is unknown since the hardtop has never been removed.  The engine and bay are clean and dry and the car starts and runs flawlessly.  The red exterior with camel interior is an extremely handsome color combination.  560 SL values are trending higher and are now being sought after by collectors and investors.  If you are seeking a 560 SL of this year you have located your car.", "I believe whoever takes delivery of this vehicle will be thrilled.", "For additional information please phone Dave Henry at 805 705-4924.", "__________________________________________________________________________________________", "Spokemotors.com is not a dealer but a marketing and advertising firm.
