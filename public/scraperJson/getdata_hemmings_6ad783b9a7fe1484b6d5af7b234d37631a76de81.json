It has performance 289, power steering, power disc brakes and it's red! We sold this car a few years ago, he enjoyed it trouble free. The motor has been upgraded with Edelbrock intake,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and carb, MSD ignition and headers. Upgraded to aluminum radiator with shroud. Upgraded brakes with large rotors and custom calipers. Motor compartment is also dressed up with chrome support bars, Monte Carlo bar, air cleaner and valve covers. As I walk around the car it's looks great. Beautiful paint has a smooth, glossy finish. It's straight and fits nice, door shuts nice. Chrome is bright. It has 17 inch Mustang wheels with Michelin tires. The interior also looks real good. The upholstery, door panels, dash pad has been replaced. Also has some upgrades including CD stereo, Sun tachometer, gauge cluster and a cushion grip steering wheel. The floors are rock solid. This Mustang is ready to enjoy again by the next owner!", "Power steering", "Power disc brakes", "Monte Carlo bar", "Custom wheels", "CD stereo", "Cushion grip wheel", "Gauge cluster", "Sun tachometer", "Dual exhaust"], "Exterior:": "Candy Apple Red", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto"}}
