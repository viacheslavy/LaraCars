The dual stripe red line tires and chrome GT wheels add some pop. Interior is completely restored, I mean everything. The obvious like upholstery, door panels and carpet are new, but the details like the bezels, knobs, handles, steering wheel, console, sill plates, armrests all sparkle. Motor compartment restored like original. Some unique features an early Mustang has is a generator, 260 motor and this one still has its original hood with an edge that mechanics claimed to hurt themselves on. The later cars had a rolled edge. No question Mustangs are the most popular collector car in the world. This one is unique and stands apart from most others.

It started out life as a 6 cylinder with a 3 speed transmission. Now has a 289 V-8 engine and a 4 speed transmission. It's updated to 5 lug wheels. Front disc brakes. Originally blue paint and it is now white. The interior is correct white with blue. Has seat belts front and rear. Blue manual top with blue boot. Top looks real good. Aftermarket AM/FM radio. It has GT exhaust tips. Andrew has had it up on the rack and he could not find any rust. The left rear fender, just above and behind the wheel, looks to have been hit. You cannot tell on the outside but in the trunk you can see it. ( see photo) We changed the wheels to style steel wheels with new white wall tires. Added front bumper guards. It's all service and safety checked and it's ready to go. This Mustang was built by Dan Wiebold Ford in Nampa Idaho for the Mercy Medical hospital charity auction in Nampa Idaho about 8 years ago.

"description": ["Usually you want a 1964.5 Ford Mustang convertible for its rarity... but this one is so much more than just that.  It's a restomod with a powerful fuel-injected V8, upgraded suspension, five-speed stick, and a terrific A/C interior.  This is exactly how to get the best of everything in one iconic package.     ", "  Everyone is on the lookout for a 1964.5 convertible.  They have the appeal of being the first to launch this iconic American, and one of the rarest versions of them all.  Plus, the black paint adds even more attention-grabbing allure.  The dark mirror shine on the convertible body is the most intimating way to distinguish your Mustang from the more friendly pony cars out there.  But from the first moment you lay eyes on this one, your thoughts are just as much about a modern mean machine as they are about a classic design.  After, all the modern headlights make this pony car look like the glowing eyes of a hungry panther.  Those Rocket five-spoke alloys are another instant clue to this car's modern performance.  ", "  Under the white folding roof is a fantastic red interior.  This just seems like the perfect color for an aggressive Mustang like this. The bucket seats, carpets, door panels, and dash all have benefited from an investment during restoration that makes them feel quite fresh. With the top down, it looks like a volcano with red-hot lava at its core. More than just a terrific first impression, the interior has all the right features to make you happy. You get all the right classic Mustang driver elements like the three-spoke sports steering wheel and extra long speedometer flanked by round auxiliary readouts.  There are also some great modern upgrades in this restomod, too. You get a cup holder center console, power steering, and an alarm system.  Plus, there's an upgraded Kenwood AM/FM/CD/XM unit that's connected to a subwoofer stereo system.  And ice-cold R134a air conditioning lets you stay as cool as you look behind the wheel.   ", "  Under the hood of this Ford icon is another blue oval legend \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a much more modern one.  Just as the bright valve covers will tell you, this is a Ford Racing motor.  The 302 cubic-inch V8 is already powerful right out of the box, but then it also received more go-fast goodies like a Holley electronic fuel-injection kit, Street Fighter ignition, MSD cap, and BBK long tube headers that add even more power as they contribute to the rumble of the dual exhaust.  Best of all, you have complete control over this powerful V8 and its thunderous soundtrack thanks to the T5 five-speed manual transmission.  As you look at how clean the undercarriage photos are, you can really tell that there are only about 2,000 miles on this one since completing restoration.  While you're looking down there, don't forget to spot all the performance driving upgrades, such as the full Ridetech suspension with Fox shocks and adjustable coilovers.  Plus, stopping is well in control, too, thanks to a Wilwood four-wheel disc brake upgrade and the modern grip of BF Goodrich gForce tires.  ", "  Complete with a ton of build receipts and owner's manual, this is the rare Mustang droptop that's also your restomod dream.  Don't let something this unique slip away.

The very nature of acquiring gains via equity is inherently risky depending on the factors and history affecting an asset. With that in mind, the idea is to find a classic which minimizes risk as much as possible. From an investment mindset, low risk is the major selling point of this 1 of 1 1964.5 Mustang. Never mind the fact that the car was assembled during the first hour of Mustang production. The fact that the car was 1 of 3 convertibles sent to Holman Moody for major modifications and subsequent pace car duty is beside the point. Just because the car was the only Ford Mustang to pace the 1964 Indianapolis 500 and, in the process, became the most modeled Ford in history doesn't mean all risk is moot. And, just because the car is a fanatically documented piece of automobilia that was driven by Ford Motor Company heir Benson Ford doesn't make it a risk-less investment. No, what matters most is that the combination of these monumental milestones provides potential buyers with one of the safest and most secure automotive assets on the planet. If you're shopping for a sure-fire winner, this, the most significant historic Mustang in the world, should be the FIRST classic you're willing to put money on!     The most significant historic Mustang in the world is a tall claim but, once you hear this convertible's incredible story, you'll whole-heartedly agree. In 1964, Lee Iacocca was preparing a massive marketing blitz for Ford's newly revealed pony car. Since the company's Falcon compact had already secured pace car duties for the 1964 Indy 500, Iacocca made his newest muse a last minute substitution. During the first hour of Mustang production, three convertibles were assembled with a combination of Falcon and 1963-coded Ford parts. And, as soon as those cars rolled off the Dearborn assembly line, they were shipped to legendary Charlotte tuner Holman Moody. In order to pace 'the great race' the cars needed to safely travel 140 miles per hour. So, the first thing Holman Moody did was, with Ford's blessing, replace the cars' stock 260 powerplants with detuned 289s that were being developed for the GT40 Le Mans racer. Next came a lowered and stiffened suspension. And finally, chrome marine handles were, along with custom flag stanchions, added for both form and function.     Unfortunately, Iacocca's grand but hasty plan encountered one major problem: Holman Moody only had time to complete two of the cars. When this Mustang and its counterpart were shipped to Indy, Mustang number three, being essentially a prototype, was scrapped. And when the two completed cars arrived at the brickyard, one immediately experienced mechanical failure. That meant the convertible you see here is the sole Mustang to, at the hands of Benson Ford, pace the 1964 Indianapolis 500. After a big day of speed and photo ops, the drop-top was unceremoniously returned to Ford.
