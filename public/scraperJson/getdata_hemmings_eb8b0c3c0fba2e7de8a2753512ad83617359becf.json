These trucks had different exterior features and were more hot rods than the standard pickups. There were many versions including the Warlocks, Lil Red Express, Midnight Express and more. We suspect this 79 Pickup is a Lil Red Express that has been customized but without serious documentation cannot be sure so we will stick with calling it a Lil 400 Express. It has all of the classic wood trim like you would find on other Expresses but the door signage has been customized to read \"Lil 440 Express Truck\" with engine turned Gold underneath. It also features custom Lil Dodge 440 lettering on the rear tail gate with pinstriping in between the wood slats. This truck has a really cool look and gets attention wherever it goes. The chrome stacks give it a really tough look and is something you just don't see often nowadays other than on those semis cruising down the highway. The paint is done in a light Yellow and is in good condition. Other exterior accents include the front windshield visor, custom bumpers and diamond plating on the top surfaces surrounding the truck bed. The bed itself is all woodgrain. The truck also features a class 5 trailer hitch and tows well. The back window is new and slides open. The original mag wheels have been replaced by American Racing rims which are wrapped with Cooper Cobra Radial G/T tires.", "This pickup has a lot more than just a tough hot rod exterior going for it because under the hood is a big block 440 motor that runs really strong. These were the largest displacement V8 put out by Chrysler and work perfectly in trucks like this. A majority of the motor as well as other components in the engine compartment are painted in a nice Blue for a really clean look. It is also fitted with chrome valve covers, a billet air cleaner, cool flex radiator hose, Edelbrock carburetor and Edelbrock manifold. Paired with the engine is a Hurst 4 speed transmission that shifts well. It just received a new clutch, pressure plate and throwout. The truck has a great sound with flowmaster exhaust routed through those tall stacks on both sides behind the cab.", "The interior is done in Black with dual bucket seats. The seat upholstery and carpeting were just redone. Between the seats is a center section that can function as a seat as needed but also houses 2 cupholders. The dash has a mostly stock layout except fore the added AM/FM/CD stereo. In addition to courtesy lights mounted to the headliner it also has a Cobra CB radio. The gauges are all brand new and just installed. $2,000 were invested in all new Dolphin white faced gauges, custom bezels, and real engine turned custom fitted trim pieces.", "This pickup is extremely fun and drives well. Whether you are looking for a new truck to drive daily or something to take to shows this one fits the bill. Start cruising around and you will be amazed how many people out there are fans of the late 70's special edition trucks.", "Make this pickup yours for $24,950.00!", "NOW REDUCED DOWN TO $20,000.00!"]}},
