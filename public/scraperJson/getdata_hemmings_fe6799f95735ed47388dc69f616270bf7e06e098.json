But not to worry, as the mechanicals show to have been thoroughly gone through with a rebuild reported within the last 5 years and 10.000 miles. In addition to installing Turbo brakes, short throw shift kit, larger Fuchs style wheels, fresh Hankook rubber and a new steering rack, the motor was warmed over with a 964 cam grind, Dansk exhaust and K and N intake filter. 930 Turbo brakes.

I am especially familiar with these 3.0 911SC models. As such you can trust me when I say this is a very quick and strong running 3.0. It doesn't leak or smoke. The lowered stance delivers a firm ride. The car tracks straight down the road and the big Turbo brakes haul it down with authority. Handling is what you would expect from an air cooled Porsche, pretty much spot on. The Dansk exhaust gives the car a raucous idle and a mechanical growl only an air cooled flat six can produce.", "The original cork interior was reupholstered and shows very well. The door panels and pockets are in great condition. The headliner is taught, original carpet in great shape. A nice set of quality coco mats add a touch of period correct class. An aftermarket Momo style steering wheel is installed. The original dash is capped but looks good and is hardly a detraction. The car also benefits from a more modern 964 AC system upgrade. The heat and defrost work as do all of the instruments, instrument lights and courtesy lights. Windows and sunroof operate as they should. Door pulls and locks in perfect working order. Being my friend is involved in the Miami music scene, he equipped the car with a killer sound system that includes a Blaupunkt head unit, and a powered sub woofer under the seat.", "I had intentions to invest in the body cosmetics but instead find myself driving it as often as possible.

Originally intended to replace the company's iconic 911, the 928 combined the power, poise, and handling of a sports car with the refinement, comfort, and equipment of a luxury saloon. Porsche executives believed such a flagship would have wider appeal than the compact, quirky and sometimes difficult 911. Each model year the 928 would introduce new advancements to stay ahead of the competition. The 1985 model brought a new S variant featuring a 5.0 liter 32-valve V8 engine that produced a healthy 288 horsepower and was equipped with the smooth-running Bosch LH-Jetronic fuel injection. This all black 928 S was produced with the rare BorgWarner synchromesh 5-speed manual transmission. It is believed that less than 20% of all 928s' were optioned with the sporty manual transmission. Power assisted rack and pinion steering point the 928 in all the right directions and the four-wheel disc brakes bring things to a controlled halt. Standard to typical Porsche performance is Porsche luxury. This 928 S has a long list of comfort and convenience features like power sunroof, leather interior, air conditioning, power bucket seats, power windows and cruise control just to name a few. With less than 64K original miles on the odometer this sports coupe has just received a full bumper-to-bumper service and is ready to be enjoyed.

This car came from the factory with all the options a true 911 driver would want- and its been treated the right way! A stacked service history including the factory recommended intervals at 30k and 60k have been done, as well as all the other little stuff in between.

You cant ask for a much better Carrera Coupe!", "This beautiful 911 was purchased new on October 14th, 1986 at Rector Motor Car Company in Burlingame CA. Just a year later, on July 12, 1987, it was sold to its second owner at Falore Eurosport where it went on to live in San Mateo, CA until late 1999 when it changed hands again. From there the car traveled to Half Moon Bay, CA where it served under its third owner and then into Arizona where its third owner has kept the car since the mid-early 2000's.

The car is arrow straight and is Carfax and Autocheck certified to have never been in an accident. This 911 has always been  garage kept and pampered its entire life and really shows. I have had the car up in the air and have fully inspected for rust of any kind, and it was clear that this car has always lived in a corrosion free environment, but also always garaged because the interior is so dang nice! Lower fenders, rockers, belly pan, and spare tire area are perfect with zero rust of any kind. I put my 15+ years in the classic car business behind my inspection.", "The car is riding on 16'' Staggered light alloy wheels with black centers.

The A/C blows ice cold and the heat works as it should.", "This car has been well looked after for all of its life. Most notable of the extensive service records are the 30k and 60k services which were done on time! The original selling dealer of this 911 (Rector Motor Car Company) did the 30k service on Feb 20th, 1992 by the second owner. At the beginning of the 3rd owner's ownership of this car, he spent nearly $4,000 in service on the car at German Auto Kraft (at 52.5k miles) including a clutch overhaul, brake service, ac system overhaul, camshaft oil lines, as well as a rear crankshaft seal. A year later, the black coupe was back for its 60k service for the recommended items as well as a transmission service, oil line replacement, new distributor and 02 sensor as well as all-new oem shock absorbers. Since the third owner has moved the car out to Arizona, it has been under the watchful eyes of Stuttgart Southwest. Over the past decade they have maintained the coupe for all of its needs from the major service and valve cover resurface (at 64.7k miles) to hood struts and steering wheel adjustments. The 911 was most recently there last month for an oil change as well as a couple leaky diverter oil lines.", "This car is ready to go! The exterior of this Coupe is stunning with special leather interior and is definitely a great color combination for the 911.
