This Mercedes 380SL put the \"Class\" in Classic. It was been meticulously maintained with a pile of documentation to go along with it. We even have the original window sticker showing the car sold for $41,733 in 1982 by todays standards that would equal over $108,000!!!! the cost of a brand new Corvette in 1982 was a tad over $20,000 so could have bought 2 of them for the price of this one. The inside leather is in terrific shape with no visible wear or tear thanks to the 1980's sheepskin seat covers that I am told have always been on the car protecting the seats. It comes with the hard top and the soft top. This car and its previous owners have made sure to document the milage as accurate and true as opposed to most letting it show exempt due to being over ten years old. So you can be sure of exactly what you are getting. the car runs great, A/C blows cold all the windows work and have not found anything not working. We would love to keep the car as an investment for ourselves but simply have no where to keep it inside and its a shame to leave a car that is this nice of this age outside for long. Come see it and although we are not giving this car away and feel the price is very very good on it we are open to cash reasonable cash offers.

this beautiful and unusual 1980 Mercedes-Benz 450SL. Even today, nearly 30 years after they went out of production, they still command respect from the general masses, and remain grade-A cars to own and drive, representing huge bang for the buck.  ", "  Like most luxury models, you could pretty much get whatever color you wanted on your SL, even in 1980. While so many of these cars were red, white, or beige, this 450SL sports a lovely silver paint job that works splendidly with the unusual tan interior. It also represents the high-water mark for the R107 roadster, a near-ideal blend of style and luxury that made it the premier luxury car of the era. It was repainted at some point, but the finish remains in good condition given the car's age, a testament to the care this car has received over the past two-and-a-half decades. Gaps and panel fit are to typical German standards and remain excellent today, indicating that this car has never been hit or wrecked. Light colors tend to minimize flaws, but even on close inspection this one has laser-straight flanks, crisply rendered body lines, and almost zero signs of road rash in any of the usual locations. All the chrome and stainless remains bright, and the US-spec rubber bumpers, which usually suffer from degradation in the sunlight, remain supple and clear. It's obvious someone loved this car for many years.  ", "  The all original tan interior is a sophisticated and unusual compliment to the silver paint, with seats beautifully rendered in MB-Tex that is both comfortable and durable. The interior's condition strongly suggests that it has been exceptionally well maintained since new: there are no wear issues on the seats, the carpets are appropriate to the car's age and mileage, and the rear package shelf, which always gets baked in the sun, shows zero discoloration, which is surely helped by the light color. You'll also note that lots of features were standard on an SL, ranging from air conditioning to cruise control to power windows, and the original Becker radio has been replaced by an AM/FM/CD head unit powering extra speakers behind the seats. Overhead there's an easy to use convertible top that fits snugly, and all SLs came standard with matching hardtops. The trunk has its original carpets that are as plush as those you'll find in lesser cars' passenger compartments, as well as a full-sized spare tire stashed underneath.  ", "  The 4.5 liter V8 is a wonderful machine, torquey and smooth with a fantastic bubbly exhaust note that sings in appropriately hushed tones thanks to a correct exhaust system. Known for their longevity, these engines are virtually indestructible given proper maintenance, and will happily run for hundreds of thousands of miles with just gas and oil changes. Judging by the underhood area, this one has been maintained over the years and shows signs of recent service, including some ignition components, hoses, and filters.

It consisted of the debut of the V8 engine on the convertible weight.  Interestingly they were dubbed originally as 350SL despite having a 4.5L V8 engine to keep with the model designation for Europe.  A true classic vehicle.
