We were excited to see the Kardex, and knew that a whole lot of work was ahead of us when the fastidious client that we sold it to said, ''Great, now restore it''! At that moment, this 1963 Carrera II Cabriolet became our very first restoration project. Upon disassembly, we hit the lottery! We found one dent, that's it, a single dent! All of the sheet metal was original, the battery pan, floor pan, all of it... The trim and hard to find items were all there, with virtually no repo parts. The engine and transmission are numbers-matching units and only needed to be fine-tuned upon re-installation. This Cabriolet presented itself as the ultimate wish list as far as restorations go. Since its completion, this award winner has been shown a couple of times; adding to its list of accolades, the 2008 Porsche Parade Zuffenhausen Award, but has primarily sat on display as part of a 356 soft top collection.
