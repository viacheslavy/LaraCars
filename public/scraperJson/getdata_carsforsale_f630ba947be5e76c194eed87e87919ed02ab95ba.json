It was originally based on the platform of the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964[3] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a \"1964\u00bd\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A. The Mustang has undergone several transformations to its current sixth generation.", " ", "The Ford Mustang was brought out five months before the normal start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are often referred to as \"1964\u00bd models\" but all Mustangs were advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though minor design updates for fall 1965 contribute to tracking 1964\u00bd production data separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production beginning in Dearborn, Michigan on March 9, 1964; the new car was introduced to the public on April 17, 1964at the New York World's Fair. The First Generation of Mustang was produced from 1965 till 1973 with many revisions to the body."], "seller_name": "P J'S AUTO WORLD-CLASSICS", "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "38900", "kilometers": 43467.135, "total_pages": 54, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/36963503", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "36963503", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "V8 5.0L", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "27,015 miles", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Stock #": "10922", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Black", "Drive Train": "RWD", "Fuel": "Gasoline", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Black"}},

"description": ["No one will ever mistake this 1967 Ford Mustang fastback restomod for anything stock.  But for the few who don't see the paint, the wheels, or any of the other new aggressive touches, the race-ready 428 Cobra Jet V8 will teach them a lesson to take notice.  ", "  This could play the villain in any movie.  The deep black paint on this coupe seems to absorb the sunlight.  It's that kind of bad attitude and hard shine that will instantly get it recognized and remembered.  The reason why this one is so well done is because the paint and body had the kind of money spent on it that people use for this whole restoration.  We have receipts from Cobra Automotive Inc for over $20k in just the paint and body work... and this huge investment shows! Ford never made a body so straight, and so this rare fastback has the kind of creases that look like they could give you a paper cut.  While the car is butter smooth, there is a grit to its attitude that tells you it eats its secretary's car siblings for breakfast.  You see it in the wide hood scoop, blacked-out front end, hood pins, and blacked-out rear panel with smoked taillights.  The black torque thrust wheels continue this dark attitude while also adding some Bullitt-level flair.  ", "  Inside there's nothing to get in the way of performance driving. The rear seats have been removed to save weight (comes with sale) and make way for the roll cage.  The front seats are now modern ProCar racing buckets with Simpson five-point harnesses.  Any coddling feature that would add weight has been replaced with race-ready toggle switches.  As the driver, you get the grippy sports steering wheel mounted on a Flaming River tilt column.  Beyond that is a full set of AutoMeter that look cool, but more importantly, give a precise readout about what's going on in this performance machine. To complete this go-fast interior, there's a Hurst shifter and a huge AutoMeter tach (after all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you're watching your revs the most in the quarter miles.)  ", "  Because people are going to want to peek under the hood, the monster motor looks terrific.  Then again, it's kind of hard not to look great with all the right hardware radiating power from within the dark engine bay.  You're looking at a 428 cubic-inch Keith Craft Racing Cobra Jet V8.  It was assembled by Pierce Racing in Huntersville, NC.  The fortified construction includes a fully machined and prepped block, ARP main studs, FelPro seals, balanced & polished crank, Federal Mogul rod bearings, Ford Racing timing set, Comp Cams hydraulic roller cam with roller rockers, FMC pistons & rings, and aluminum heads built by DSC Motorsports.  Plus, it has the right go-fast upgrades like a Holley AED 750 four-barrel carburetor, Edelbrock Performer intake, MSD ignition, and hand-crafted NASCAR-style headers.  There is a ton more to this monster motor's investment, but we don't have the room to list it here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so call us for all the details.  For now, just know the moment you fire this one up, it has the kind of thunder that makes lesser cars cower away.  Handling all this huge horsepower and neck-snapping torque is a Tremec TKO600 five-speed manual transmission that was specially built by AMP Performance ($3,500 receipt) to go with the upgraded motor.  This feeds the Ford 9 Detroit Locker rear end with strong Moser 35 spline axles.  A build this intense also requires the right suspension upgrades.  That's why you have a TCI Mustang II-style independent front suspension, reinforced frame, and TCI three-link rear.  Plus, adjustable coilovers, Bilstein shocks, and a full Wilwood four-wheel disc brake package are all part of this fully-built Mustang.  ", "  Complete with build receipts and restoration photos, this is the classic that's not for the faint of heart or the Sunday driver.  But if you're looking for the ultimate street villain to give everyone else nightmares, this classic Mustang is the dark horse of your dreams."], "seller_name": "Streetside Classics", "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "Loading Listings", "price": "94995", "kilometers": 205.952, "total_pages": 54, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/36720578", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "36720578", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "428 Cobra Jet V8", "Fuel Economy": "N/A", "Mileage": "128 miles", "Transmission": "5 Speed Manual", "Stock #": "4360-CHA", "Interior/Exterior": "Black / Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "", "Interior / Exterior Colors": "Black / Black"}},

Mostly because it's a driver! It's not only extremely collectible, but it's solid and ready to be enjoyed. It's becoming harder and harder to find 289, 4-speed mustang convertibles priced below $30,000!     This '65 left the factory an original Raven Black convertible. Today it still sits covered in a fresh Raven Black repaint that was buffed and wet-sanded to a gorgeous shine. Black isn't one of those colors that you can hide a lot of flaws in and this one shows very well. It does appear that the quarters have been replaced at some point and the floors do have some patches in them, but both seem to have been done very well.     Powered by the iconic Ford 289ci V8, that has been painted in the legendary FoMoCo blue and equipped with flat black Mustang themed valve covers and air filter, this engine is a very reliable powerplant. Underneath the hood you'll also see a new starter, new flywheel, new coil, new distributor and new radiator. Bolted to the engine is a 4-speed manual transmission that sends power to a Ford 8.8. Stopping power comes courtesy of 4-wheel drum brakes.     If you are looking for your next springtime cruise vehicle, this is it! Don't miss out! It's not everyday you come across a factory raven black, 289, 4-speed convertible!

This particular pony is finished in beautiful Raven Black paint accented by a fresh Palomino tan interior and soft top.

Unlike many T code Mustangs out there this convertible is still powered by the original 200CI inline 6 cylinder engine mated to a smooth shifting cruise-o-matic transmission.  The car was subject to a comprehensive restoration just a few years ago and shows like new.    Best of all this Mustang is equipped with factory style dealer installed air conditioning for those days that it is too sunny to put the top down. Other features include AM radio, luggage rack, GT style wheel covers, Firestone radial tires, and proper trunk mat complete with jack and spare.
