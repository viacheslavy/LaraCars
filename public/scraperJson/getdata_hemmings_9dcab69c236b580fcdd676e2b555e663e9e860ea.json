Delorean was building a truly remarkable car and certainly in 1981 when lets face it, design of cars were quite boring. People flocked to purchase the DMC-12 even though the cost was twice of what the original price was going to be. The body design by Italians, it's powered by the French and built by the Irish.

This model offered here was also outfitted with a 3-speed automatic transmission. At just 38 408 miles since new, this DMC 12 remains tidy in all areas. The interior is clean, shows some patina and the seats appear to have been re-upholstered. The stainless steel body panels retain good consistent grain and are straight, and all the glass is good. The car starts, runs and drives well and is ready for your future.", "The DMC 12 is an automotive icon and represents an import part of automotive history. The brand has a unique story and these cars will always have a following; a staple for any collection for sure. Documentation includes: Original window sticker, original bill of sale, original manual and warranty book, shop manual, sales brochure, articles and accolades.", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.
