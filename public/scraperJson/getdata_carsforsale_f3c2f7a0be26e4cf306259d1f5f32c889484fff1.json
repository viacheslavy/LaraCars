British Motor Industry legend Sir Leonard Lord, soon convinced Healey that Austin should build the car and thus gave birth to the Austin-Healey 100. The Austin-Healey's design and appeal as a true British Sports Car, resulted in strong sales across the globe in the late 1950's and early 60's. Over time the design and drive train matured to the 6-cylinder Austin-Healey 3000, which featured a more comfortable interior, improved braking, and suspension. 1967 would marque the last production model year of the Austin-Healey 3000, the last of the great \"big Healeys\" and is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the Austin-Healey brand. ", "The 1967 Austin-Healey 3000 Mark III Phase II Roadster featured here is finished in gorgeous Ivory White with a beautiful original black interior. This extremely rare find has only traveled 55,794 miles from new and still wears most of its original paint. A few years ago this motorcar was subject to an extensive mechanical rejuvenation by an Austin Healey judge. This marque specialist was tasked with ensuring the car's drivability while going to great lengths to preserve its incredible originality, using only the best parts available including numerous New Old Stock components. Since completed this magnificent motorcar has been shown at numerous Concours shows and was the recipient of the coveted Palmetto Award of Preservation at the 2013 Hilton Head Concours d'Elegance. Accompanying this investment-grade Austin Healey 3000 Mark III is its tools, brochure, mechanical restoration receipts, British Motor Industry Heritage certificate, previous registrations and much more. It has been said that cars are only original once and we are proud to offer what we believe to be one of the finest original Austin Healey\u2019s on the market today. Classic cars have proven to be among the most resilient and rewarding investments in recent years with the Historic Automobile Group Index (HAGI) jumping 39% in 2013 and posting gains of 395-percent over the last 10-years.

Designated the BJ8, the 2+2 Mark III was the most powerful and luxurious of the big Healeys, with a standard walnut-veneer dash, wind-up windows, and a 150 hp I-6 cylinder engine. Added power came from a new camshaft and valve springs, twin SU 2\" HD8 carburettors, and a new exhaust system design. Servo-assisted brakes were also standard. Options remained otherwise the same, except that the standard interior trim was downgraded to Ambla vinyl, with leather as an extra.

Finished in a traditional color combination that will never go out of style and offering a few choice upgrades, it delivers on all the promises made by its reputation and remains an A-list collectable today.  ", "  Repainted about ten years ago, this big roadster still looks great with only minor signs of use, which it wears like badges of honor. A long life down south means that the usual rust demons were kept at bay with this one and it's one of those rare cars that has been properly maintained all its life and therefore never needed any major surgery to bring it back to its current condition. Clean bodywork has factory-style gaps and great panel alignment so it looks properly assembled and aside from a few nicks and touch-ups that are all but invisible until you go looking for them, this car is just beautiful from any angle. Healeys have always projected an aura of power and refinement, and this one is no different, hunkering on its haunches like a cat about to spring, it's every bit as entertaining to drive as it looks. Chrome and brightwork are excellent, including the lovely Healey grille, bumpers, and all the badges that adorn the car. And you'll love the details that come with these cars, from the sporting driving lights up front to the practical luggage rack to the Lucas taillights in their own little pods.  ", "  Gorgeous is the only way to describe the inviting and nicely patina'd interior. With leather surfaces in basic black, it complements the bodywork extremely well and offers a traditional look. The Healey's longer wheelbase allows two small rear seats, and while they're best reserved for children or luggage, they are no less carefully stitched than the front buckets. New carpets were fitted and the hand-crafted door panels are an exercise in effective minimalism. The original Smiths gauges are in good condition, showing only some light discoloration on their chrome bezels, but that should polish away pretty easily, and the speedometer will need to be checked since it's not currently operational. Perhaps most remarkably, this car has an aftermarket A/C system tucked in the dash, yet the work is so expertly done that it's almost invisible and doesn't detract from the original look. A black folding top has been installed, and it includes matching black boot to keep things looking tidy when it's stowed, and roll-up windows were finally standard equipment with the BJ8. The trunk isn't exactly spacious, but does include a full-sized spare and matching wire wheel, which is nice.  ", "  The BJ8 is powered by a 2.9 liter inline-six rated at a relatively brawny 150 horsepower, which provides entertaining performance in the lightweight roadster. Faithfully restored in Austin's peculiar shade of metallic light green, the engine rumbles to life easily, inhaling t"], "seller_name": " Message Seller", "title": "1967 Austin-Healey 3000 Mark III BJ8 ", "total_results": "15 .
