From front to back it shows a great level of craftsmanship that combines with a rock solid running condition and some standout features to make it well-suited for everything from wowing audiences with its high-functioning hydraulics to turning heads with its sharp looks in everyday driving situations.", "While we're starting to see more cars sporting a matte textured look these days, it's still fairly rare to encounter a classic dressed out this way, so this '55 has a ''made you look'' factor right off the bat. Novelty, of course, only gets you so far without proper execution, but there are no worries in that regard, as you'll find that this classic pickup will impress at close range. The combination of the matte black paint sitting alongside an array of chrome exterior fittings that are all in top form really creates a magnetic visual experience. Come around to the front and you'll see a great looking chrome grille looming over a clean, sturdy front bumper, as well as a hood adorned with some very impressive pinstriping. From the side, you'll notice the dramatic effect of the shaved suicide doors - the absence of the usual door handles creates an uninterrupted sea of black that really ups the curb appeal. Its body panel alignment looks very strong from all angles and fresh-looking, clear glass surrounds the cabin.", "The interior mixes new and old elements to arrive at a very effective monochrome look totally in keeping with the high impact exterior. The bucket seats offer a level of support and comfort well out of reach of the original bench seating, with black covers that are well-fitted and still have a fresh look to them. In front of the leather wrapped chrome steering wheel, the dash area sports a fan-shaped instrument panel that carries an assortment of Dakota Digital gauges that are all in good working order and illuminate the cabin in blue. A very clean dash pad runs the width of the cabin while below, the original circular brake pedal sits in place to offer a nice contrast. There's no shortage of audio options on board here - the Alpine AM/FM/CD stereo mounted at the center of the dash also offers iPod and Bluetooth connectivity. As opposed to more commonly encountered wooden planks, the bed area on this Chevy is lined with diamond plate - a great visual detail that's a perfect complement to the rest of the truck.", "A 350 cubic inch V8 sits in the engine compartment, surrounded by matte black walls so it really stands out. It's armed with a Holley 4-barrel carb and Edelbrock intake that sit underneath a chrome air cleaner, and its pair of chrome valve covers with their etched flames really look nice in this setting. The powerplant teams with a 3-speed automatic TH350 transmission to make up a very high functioning drive train. The featured Air Ride suspension that allows virtually endless ride height adjustability on this Chevy is in very good working order and provides a high level of drivability to go along with its novelty. In fact, the overall solid road manners on this '55 come as a welcome surprise, given its high impact look. Power steering makes for easy navigation, while power brakes at all four corners - with discs up front, provide low-effort, fade resistant stops as this great looking truck cruises on its set of outstanding 17'' Ridler wheels that have an unusually brilliant finish.", "Its coveted combination of exceptional curb appeal and strong driving condition makes this 1955 Chevrolet 3100 a rare find.

These classic \"??55 pickups are known as the Second Series and were the start of an all new body style that ran from 1955 to 1959. This one is far from original with a complete restoration and shows very well. This beautiful pickup is powered by a LS2 which was rebuilt about 3000 miles ago. This LS2 has a LS-6 Cam Kit and was rebuilt by G&G Machine. There may be some confusion on the engine due to the 5.7L engine cover but this was simply due to not being able to find a 6.0L engine cover for it. It\"??s estimated to be putting out over 400hp meaning this old truck will run against most cars on the street well. This powerhouse is mated to a T-56 6-speed manual transmission with a competition clutch and runs through the gears with ease. The power is driven to the back tires by the Ford 9\"?\u009d Posi rear end and has 3.70 gears for both leisure and performance. The front end is a Fatman Mustang II with stainless upper and lower control arms. To give the truck more flare an IDIDIT chrome steering column was added as well. To make this truck show quality the firewall has been smoothed giving a clean presentation of the engine. This truck also features an aluminum radiator new doors stainless 18-gallon fuel tank new bumpers new rear fenders and much more. This truck is painted in a mouth watering \"??Organic Green\"?\u009d which is a House of Kolor Paint. It also has subtle brown colored accents. This Organic Green color swarms the truck from the engine and through the interior as well. Walking around the truck if you\"??re not drooling to much you will notice a fresh new Oak bed that has been stained and polyurethane and a new chrome grille. The interior of this truck is just as clean as the outside. With brown ultra-leather interior it keeps the color scheme flowing from the inside out. You can monitor the trucks performance through the classic instrument cluster. This truck is a solid mix of classic styling with modern amenities.

So pay attention to the details, because a classic of this caliber commands extra notice.", "We all love Chevy's Advance Design pickups, and this one really shows us why.  It was given a complete restoration about a decade ago and treated with respect ever since.  So the tall five-bar grille still shines like a mirror, and so do the bumpers.  The green paint represents a correct Juniper Green and has a terrific shine of nostalgia.  The restoration also added the right period-correct elegance, like the fresh lumber in the truck bed, windshield sun visor, Chevrolet step plates, and side-mounted spare.  And speaking of the wheels, proper two-piece units with whitewalls are exactly what you want.  Also, have you noticed how the yellow pinstripe running around the cab also matches the one on the wheels?  Oh yes, they really paid attention to detail here.", "Inside this looks quite correct, but you also might spot some nice subtle upgrades.  For example, you got a bench seat in 1953, but it was never covered in comfortable velour or offered seatbelts.  The door panels match this upgrade nicely.  The AM radio and heater have that ideal vintage feeling.  And when you grab the grooved three-spoke steering wheel, you'll be instantly transported to a simpler time.", "Under the hood, the 216 cubic-inch straight-six motor looks honest and complete \u2013 right down to the oil bath air cleaner.  But take a moment to dig deeper and see the right upgrades.  The alternator, starter, wiring, and much more are part of a useful package.  And the way this motor fires right up confirms this is a fine driving classic.  The engine still produces the kind of torque that made these an industrial legend, and the three-on-the-tree manual transmission is always great for flexibility.  Overall, going for a drive in this pickup is a fun experience thanks to the great rumble from a rhythmic motor that doesn't know how to quit.", "This Chevy is pure excitement to those who love to drive their history with pride.

Well, here's the answer to your question, a spectacular 1956 Chevrolet 3100 pickup with a high-powered ZZ4 350 inside plus a cabin full of luxury options. Talk about having your cake and eating it too!", "Painted a brilliant semi-metallic green from DuPont called ''Pond Scum Green,'' this slick pickup represents the first of the pickups that were actually styled by designers rather than merely engineered. As a result, they carry a lot of automotive-inspired design cues, and if you see a little bit of Shoebox Chevy in the design, the coincidence is purely intentional. Of course, the fact that it was finished to today's standards certainly helps, and there's not a ripple, dent, pockmark, or dent anywhere on the beautiful surface of this truck. The paint is about a mile deep, and has been rubbed and buffed to a mirror-like shine, and while there are a few signs of having been driven, it's still a show-stopper. Enhancing the polished look is a custom 1957 grille, shaved emblems, and a bunch of louvers punched into the tailgate. Behind that tailgate, you'll find a beautifully finished oak bed with polished stainless strips that tie in with the bright chrome bumpers and taillights. And you'll note this is the desirable ''big window'' cab, making it feel airy inside without spoiling the vintage look.", "Gorgeous tan leather is the dominant theme inside, with the original bench seat replaced by what appears to be a custom split bench that looks right at home in the cab. Custom door panels and plus carpets certainly help it feel far more luxurious than 1956. Fortunately, it retains a '50s sensibility but the modern materials will definitely attract more than their fair share of appreciative nods at shows. The dash uses a set of custom gauges that mimic the original while providing a bit more information, and A/C vents have been discreetly tucked underneath in their own special panel. A tilt wheel with a custom billet wheel adds to the 21st century feel, as well as the custom head unit in the original radio's slot, with speakers scattered throughout the cab. It's just spectacular inside and you can see that cubic dollars were spent to make it look this good.", "Underneath that beautiful green sheetmetal, you'll find a heavily fortified chassis. Up front there's a 350 cubic inch ZZ4 crate motor that packs quite a bit more power than the original 283. There's plenty of flash thanks to the custom pinstriped air cleaner assembly, finned valve covers, and a few chrome bits. But it's also fully operational thanks to an Edelbrock carb, Bow Tie intake manifold, and a big Walker radiator up front. Power rack-and-pinion steering and power front disc brakes came with the Southern Rods independent front suspension, which gives it agile handling, particularly for a pickup. A smooth-shifting automatic transmission clicks through the gears, feeding a GM rear end from a 2001 Chevy Blazer hanging on a 4-link with coil-over shocks. A Flowmaster dual exhaust system gives it just a little bit of rumble, but it doesn't intrude, making this truck an easy long-distance hauler.

In 1955 Chevrolet revealed what is now referred to as the second series. 1955 was the first year for this new body style which had wrap-around windshield\"?a truck industry first\"?and optional wrap-around rear window on Deluxe cabs. Power steering and power brakes became available for the first time on GM trucks. Electrical system upgraded to 12 volts. This was also the only year for seven-foot bed length. Fenders have single headlights and one-piece emblem is mounted below horizontal line on fender. The 1956 version had a few slight changes which included a wider hood emblem & two-piece fender emblem that are mounted above horizontal fender line. This was also the last year for egg crate grille. This 1956 is gorgeous both inside and out. Starting first with the interior which looks very sharp and crisp using a black bench seat outlined in red- it certainly makes it pop to the eye. They\"??ve also kept the dash very period correct simplistic and original looking even retaining the \"??old-school\"?\u009d AM-only radio built into dash directly. The exterior is painted red and emphasizes the patina appearance allowing the Chevy chrome to shine that much brighter from the grill and side pieces. As for the truck-bed it\"??s a well laid wooden bed which similar to its paint job shows small signs of usage. This should be expected since these were the backbone/life line to many of working men back in the day. It\"??s a great truck which is going to make someone a happy new owner very soon. Will that be you? To view the truck in greater detail including 100+ HD photos and HD video please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com.

This slightly custom body off restored 1958 Chevrolet Pickup has a beautiful look and was very well done. The word \"clean\" comes to mind when checking it out because it is clear there was a lot of attention to detail with no component overlooked. Subtle features like hiding all the wiring under the hood takes the truck to the next level and really sets it apart from your average resto mod pickup. The body is in great condition and is coated in a nice Black paint that has a very high quality finish. While the body was off the frame was powder coated which really cleans up the undercarriage nicely. It has all new front and rear bumpers which have a beautiful shine along with the new grill. All of the original side and hood trim pieces have been removed with the holes fill for a nice slick exterior. The glass has been replaced throughout and this pickup has the small window in back. One of the most eye catching features on these old trucks is always the bed and this one has been completely redone with all new dark wood. It has a beautiful look and the polished runners were replaced as well. A custom frame was built to mount in the back and hold an ice chest which comes with the truck. It was constructed in a way to be stable and steady moving down the road but not damage the bed underneath so load up your drinks along with your car show gear and you are set for the day. The truck has a great stance with a slight forward rake and rides on chrome rally wheels.", "Powering the pickup is a 454 V8 motor that is all new. It has been bored 30 over and features an aftermarket cam, headers, 780cfm Holley carburetor, MSD ignition, Tru Track serpentine belt system and Edelbrock manifold. Topping off the engine is a very cool one of a kind custom built air cleaner that connects to the front shroud which is also all custom. Everything in the engine compartment is very well done and has a clean finished look. Small details like the custom housing for the AC/Heat hoses shows how much meticulous work went into the build. The firewall is painted in the gloss Black with the underside of the hood and front shroud done in more of a matte Black wrinkle finish. This creates a really cool contrast and makes for a show ready appearance that is easy to maintain. It isn't just looks though because the motor runs very strong and delivers a deep rumble through the 3\" exhaust with Flowmasters. During the rebuild a 76 Camaro front clip was added with disc brakes and a 9\" Ford rear end with disc brakes as well. The rear is a limited slip with 2:75 gears and 31 spline axles. Paired with the engine is a Turbo 400 automatic transmission that moves through the gears with ease. In addition to power brakes the truck has power steering and AC so you have all of the comforts of that daily driver. Another important feature to mention is the relocation of the gas tank. Originally these tanks were mounted behind the seat and notorious for letting some of that gasoline smell leak into the cab. Well that is no issues here because the tank has been relocated to under the bed with a flush mounted pop out door on the drivers side rear fender. This also opened up the area behind the seat for a lot more storage space.", "The interior is complete in Black leather upholstery with a very comfortable split bench seat with armrest. The dash has been repainted in Black and houses the new original style gauges and AM/FM stereo. The AC is a Vintage Air underdash unit that blows cold with no problems. On the doors you will find the original style window cranks but these have been customized to actually operate the power windows. In front of the driver is an Ididit steering column that is nicely topped off with a vintage Impala steering wheel.", "This is a very well built pickup that is fresh with only 2,400 miles since being completed.
