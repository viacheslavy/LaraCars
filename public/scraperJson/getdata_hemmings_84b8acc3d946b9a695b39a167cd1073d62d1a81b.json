With only 47501 actual miles on the odometer this numbers matching 365 HP 327 Cubic Inch V8 Corvette fires right up. This Corvette is an absolute pleasure to drive anywhere not to mention the double takes and thumbs up you\"??ll get. The engine compartment is extremely clean with everything being factory correct. The 4 speed manual transmission shifts smooth and the clutch feels healthy when youre banging through the gears. The rear end has the factory  gears which makes this Corvette a lot of fun to hit the streets with.  The 1964 Corvette saw a few changes over the first C2 that was introduced in 1963. The ride quality was greatly improved with the swap to progressive rate front coil springs as opposed to the prior constant rate springs and the rear leaf thickness was also altered this allowed for far greater handling. Even with the changes made to the suspension for a more comfortable ride the Corvette didnt have to sacrifice its performance this car will carve through corners like you would expect a Corvette to. The Daytona Blue metallic paint is in good shape and is believed to have only been repainted once. The black interior of this Corvette is in excellent shape with no rips tears or cracks in the dash. The factory clock still works so be sure to disconnect the battery or keep a battery tender on it when not in use!  Options on this car include; AM/FM Radio Rally Wheels with Radial Tires Seat Belts Vinyl Interior and Windshield Wipers.

Bright two-tone paint and even brighter chrome make quite an impression on the outside.  The V8 power with a four-speed keep you wanting to hop in and go for a drive.  And since this icon is ready to roll right now, what's stopping you from enjoying this symbol of the open road?", "This is the year everything really seemed to come together for the Corvette.  The design was a bit sleeker, but it still has the right features from the first 'Vettes, like a hint of tailfin and a genuine trunk. After all, the first-generation Corvette is an icon in all of our hearts, so the little differences are part of the fun of ownership.  And speaking of difference, this one will be distinctive wherever it goes.  The white paint with silver cove inserts showcases an understated flash.  Where the real flair is showcased on this one is in the brightwork.  You can tell there was a nice investment in chrome in all the places that count, including the toothy-grille, two-piece front bumpers, and two-piece rear with integrated exhaust.  And because no Corvette is complete without a touch of red, we love how the color of the steel wheels gives a hint of aggression behind the bright factory wheel covers.", "The hint of red on the wheels is also a great preview of the interior.  The dash, carpeting, door panels, and bucket seats all retain a nice cherry hue.  And speaking of the seats, because C1 ownership is all about the details, don't forget to point out the horizontal pleats that were only on the '59s.  There's a healthy dose of brightwork on the door panels, dash, and steering wheel and it's all complete and shining, like a good classic should.  The thin and grippy wheel feels great in your hands, and it gives you a commanding view of the full gauge panel.  And because everything is working (including the important tach in this stick-shift car), there's nothing stopping you from going out and having a Route 66-style adventure.   There's even an upgraded AM/FM stereo with an aux input for the most modern music players, and that makes sure you can hear your favorite tunes while the wind whips through the cabin.  On those days when you don't want the open air experience, a color-matched hardtop and full roll-up windows completely enclose this C1.", "The presentation under the hood looks terrific with the silver Corvette script on the valve covers, bright air topper, and bold block and intake color.  This retains the correct 283 cubic-inch displacement, but the V8 is a slightly newer block from the 1960s.  Plus, there has been the right maintenance like newer hoses and an upgraded distributor.  This makes for a motor that fires up nicely and a classic Corvette you can confidently enjoy on the road.   When you do, you'll love the hit of power from the four-barrel carburetor.  Plus, the control of the four-speed manual transmission and the howl of the dual exhaust are an intoxicating symphony for the senses.", "The C1 Corvette is an icon, and so rarely will you get a chance at something so beautiful that's also turn-key ready for fun this weekend.
