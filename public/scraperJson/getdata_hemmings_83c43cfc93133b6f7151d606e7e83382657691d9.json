A solid investment and the more modern application is why it has such a nice hard shine.  Not only does it look aggressive, but also it's the perfect color to help really appreciate the bright work.  Thin form-hugging bumpers, pony corral grille, rear fender inserts, and all that trim around the glass just seem to pop a bit brighter on this one.

You get all the things you love about a first-generation Mustang, like the bucket seats, floor shifter, and the sporty '66 round gauge package.  The wood-rimmed steering wheel just looks like it's calling out to you from within the darkness.  Plus, this one has been subtly upgraded for more modern comfort with a cup holder center console and a retro-style AM/FM cassette stereo.", "When you look under the hood, there is a lot of extra power radiating from within the dark engine bay.  Rebuilt only about 500 miles ago, the whole presentation of the motor is bright and fresh.  Plus, you're looking at 302 cubic-inch V8 \u2013 larger than anything offered in the '66 Mustang.  And the upgrades don't end there.  It inhales deeply from an Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, and it exhales with authority as headers add even more power before feeding the glasspack-style exhaust exiting below the car.  So you get strong power and serious growl from this classic Mustang.  To keep the performance focused on the road, you also have upgrades like sub-frame braces and traction bars.  Plus, with the three-speed automatic transmission and power brakes, this extra-power pony is also set up to be a fine cruiser.", "When a great total package like this is available for such an obtainable price, you know this is one of the hottest deals going.

In fact, it was the color of the first Mustang sold, and so it makes it extra nice to have it the factory-correct on this one.  But what really attracts you to this is the level of gloss and shine that comes from a quality respray.  The extra luster of the paint helps to highlight the straightness of the sheetmetal as well as go nicely with the mirror-like quality of the bumpers and all the vivid trim.  More than just bright, this has a little extra performance attitude with additions like the American Racing Torq Thrust wheels and the red triple rocker stripe.", "We know why they added the red stripes on the exterior.

Plush carpeting, solid door panels, and taut red vinyl on the bucket seats make this very inviting.  The thin and grippy three-spoke steering wheel has the perfect vintage feeling, and the ultra-wide speedometer is a favorite these days.  And the atmosphere is so authentic, that when they upgraded to an AM/FM radio w/digital tuner, they used one with a retro appearance to make sure nothing spoils the vintage atmosphere.", "Under the hood, this C-code Mustang still retains its proper 289 cubic-inch V8 setup.

And the undercarriage photos reveal that the investment in this one was over every inch.  So as And as you look at the clean underside with newer bushings and stainless dual exhaust, you understand that this is one of the most solid cruising coupes around.  That's why it also has good driving features like power steering and a three-speed automatic transmission.", "This is the first-year Mustang that gets it right, and it's all offered for an affordable price.

Their prized project combined the sensibilities of a sports car with the convenience of seating for four, and the result was such a success that the Mustang carved out an entirely new niche on the automotive landscape - the Pony Car. This 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang convertible was there from the beginning of all that euphoria and now, more than a half century later, it's ready to provide plenty of enjoyment on the road to go along with its direct link to that pivotal time.", "Clad in its original shade of Pagoda green that sits underneath a very solid clearcoat, this Mustang provides visual evidence as to why Ford scored such a decided victory. It's compact, yet not cramped ... sporty, yet not at all ostentatious. Its long hood and short deck lid became a hallmark of the classic muscle cars that would follow, but at the time of its release, it was a design that boldly defied the norm. The finishing touches on this Pony have all been carefully looked after, so you'll find its bumpers both fore and aft sitting appropriately level and sporting clean chrome, its body alignment impressively tight and even, and its trim - from headlight to taillight casings - all representing well. Should you find yourself out on the road enjoying an open-air motoring session and the skies above you turn dark, there's no need to worry - the power black convertible top is in fine condition and raises easily into place to protect you from inclement weather.", "There's a very clean black vinyl interior sitting inside the doors and, from the looks of things, it's been well sheltered to keep it out of reach of the sun's harmful influence, so its upgraded Pony furnishings all look great. The low-backed bucket seats up front don't appear to have seen much use, and an expanse of clean black carpeting, punctuated by Pony floor mats up front, sits just underneath. Despite the Mustang's modest size, you'll find an unexpected amount of legroom in back. The dash area looks great, even for a restored classic. The instrument cluster is occupied by a crystal-clear speedometer and a pair of gauges to each side that sport very fresh looking silver frames, joined by a pair of aftermarket oil and water temperature gauges just below. An underdash air conditioning system has been added with an upgraded compressor running on R134a. And in back, the trunk area looks straight and the signature Ford plaid lining leaves enough exposed steel to see that the trunk floors and inner wheelhouses are well aligned and solid.", "You'll find a very clean engine compartment underneath the hood, with a smooth-running 260-cubic inch V8 sitting front and center with a chrome air cleaner on top, surrounded by fresh-looking hoses, belts and clean components. You can read every word on the oil filter sitting below - a strong indication that the gaskets just above are fresh and doing their job. The engine pairs with a 3-speed automatic C4 renowned for its durability to make for a low-effort and dependable drive train. When this Mustang debuted, front disc brakes weren't a given, but they're on board here to provide fade-resistant braking. A look underneath will reveal a reassuringly sturdy undercarriage with new-looking floor pans, suspension components and dual exhaust system. This Ford classic sits on a set of 15'' stock Mustang rims outfitted with Arizonian Silver Edition III tires.", "It's the car that started an automotive movement, and you don't often find examples as clean as this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible.

In 1964, Ford presented the Playboy Playmate of the Year with a convertible Mustang with a color code WT9301 or Playmate Pink. In 1965, this color was a special order option that was produced in Ford's San Jose, California assembly plant. On a true Playmate Pink Mustang, the door VIN plate will be missing a paint code and instead there will be a DSO (District Sales Office) number which indicates the car was special-ordered by the dealer.  This Mustang fits that criteria.  There is no official data on the number produced, but according to our limited research, we believe there was less than 100 vehicles with this color. Although this vehicle did get repainted over 10 years ago, they did an excellent job on the body that is in excellent condition.  Other than the very rare color, this vehicle has the original 289 V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor and the original C4 three speed automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes and original AM radio. The interior is restored to original white with black trim and looks fantastic. We can arrange shipping to your location. If you have any questions, please contact Savannah Classic Cars 912-235-2347 (no texts)."], "Exterior:": "Playmate Pink", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "31127"}},
