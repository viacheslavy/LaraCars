"93975", "description": ["After a some-what slow transition in to the Sports Car world, by the time the 1958 models had entered the arena they were very much holding ground on being one of the leaders in the two-seat sports cars of the world.  The 1958 model had a few enhancements over the 56-57 models like exposed four-headlamps as apposed to the singles.  The Grilles were more prominent than before and the interior and instruments were updated.  There were four engine options for the 1958 model year, two of which offered carburetion and two that offered fuel injection.  The most sought after was the 290 HP fuel injected model which this car was at inception.", "So this particular 1958 Vette has some great history.  It is on consignment from a gentleman that has owned the car continuously since 1964.  When he bought the car the original engine had already been removed and a 327, 340 HP with dual quads and a 3-speed had been added.  He drove the car for roughly six years and then stored it.  After a move in 1975 he then began driving it occasionally.  Then in 1980 he restored the Vette and added a 350 V8 with a 4-bolt main, roller rockers a larger cam, a high rise intake and 4-speed Muncie rock crusher transmission.   At that time the car was re-painted, body modifications were done and the original Keystone classics were added. ", "This car has receipts dating back to the 60\u2019s that come with the car as well as the original owners manual.  This car starts and drives so nice and sounds even better with the solid lifters and cam.  This car has some seriously cool history but started off equally as cool as a 290 HP FI car, HD suspension and Brakes (144) and color Blue and Silver (726)", "To see over 80 photos of this car, including under carriage please visit our website www.grautogallery.com"], "title": "1958 Chevrolet Corvette ", "total_results": "17", "price": "64900", "kilometers": 151205.775, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/22375989", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "22375989", "year": "1958", "model": "Corvette", "specs": {"Engine": "350 V8", "Mileage": "93,975 miles", "Exterior Color": "Burgundy Metallic", "Transmission": "Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": "Gasoline"}},

This late production example was restored an estimated 10 years ago and continues to appear exceptionally fresh in person! The paint finish is superb on a no-hit body that possesses excellent fit and body gaps. Matching in quality are excellent chrome & stainless pieces, upgraded Coker Classic radial whitewall tires, new brake system, new fuel delivery lines, along with a detailed engine with correct GM hoses, clamps, fresh air ducting, 7-ribbed aluminum Corvette valve covers, heater core & gaskets, etc. It received new chassis rubber & suspension components underneath, but appears to have never had its body removed since it was born in June 1958. Having been shown more than driven these last few years so the carburetors have been recently cleaned & adjusted, along with new front wheel bearings & kingpins, new spark plugs & points, valve cover gaskets, and oil/filter change. It drives with perfect ease! The engine response never falters; it travels effortlessly down the road, and keeps pace with everyday traffic making this a perfect summertime cruiser, and terrific Corvette investment! Thedash clockis presently inoperable. All tire changing equipment and spare tire are present, as well as carpeted front floor mats. Although somewhat biased, we believe this is THE color combination to have in our opinion! Truly gorgeous!

That's because, regardless of year, every C1 shares a connection to the car that started a now legendary brand. To this very day, 1953-62 Corvettes are highly desirable collectables that continue to be some of the most sought after cars on the planet. And this sweet roadster, the beneficiary of a fresh, body-off restoration, is a perfect example of why. With a hot LT1/6-speed drivetrain and stunning red on red aesthetics, it's an excellent tribute to the golden age of Americana. And, if you're looking for a unique classic that you can drive, show off and watch appreciate, it's the fully sorted head turner you've been patiently waiting for!      BODYWORK/TRIM    Stripped all the way down to glass, this contoured roadster's curvaceous body was massaged back to life during a body-off, nut-and-bolt restoration. Like most C1s, the car was originally assembled at GM's new-for-1954 St. Louis manufacturing facility. And, like most restored C1s, its fit and finish presents much better now than it did 59 years ago. In fact, judging by the looks of this Chevy's smooth fuselage, there's no evidence it has ever seen any kind of catastrophic damage. And today, layered in vivid Victory Red 2-stage, the car rolls as one spectacular classic that's superbly detailed.    1958 to 1962 was a banner era for the Corvette, as Chevrolet wanted to prove its new flagship could run with the best cars in the world while retaining classic style that would eventually bear an American icon. At the front of this polished and refinished drop-top, a toothy grille rides between chrome-trimmed headlights, a translucent header roundel and chrome-trimmed parking lamps. At the sides of that grille, intricate bumpers bend around chrome-trimmed fenders that are detailed with small cross-flags and finned cove inserts. Between those fenders, a '58-exclusive hood leads the eye to polished wipers, tinted glass and a fresh white roof that's stretched across a fresh frame. At the back of that hood, traditional mirrors reflect traditional door handles. And at the back of the car, a flowing decklid hangs a second Corvette roundel and '58-exclusive trunk spears between chrome bumpers and flush, chrome-trimmed taillights.    ENGINE    If you think the exterior of this classic is impressive, you're going to LOVE what's under its hood! Sourced from a Formula Firebird, the car's high performance LT1 is widely regarded as one of the best small blocks ever"], "title": "1958 Chevrolet Corvette ", "total_results": "17", "price": "125900", "kilometers": 4839.872, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27286710", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "27286710", "year": "1958", "model": "Corvette", "specs": {"Engine": "LT1 350 V8", "Mileage": "3,008 miles", "Exterior Color": "Victory Red", "Transmission": "6 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
