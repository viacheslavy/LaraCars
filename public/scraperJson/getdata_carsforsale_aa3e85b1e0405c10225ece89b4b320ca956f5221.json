This 1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 has a modern shine, A/C interior, and extra growl from the 351 V8.  But it never loses that original macho Mach 1 attitude that makes this fastback irresistible.  ", "  There was a lot of time, effort, and money put into this coupe, and you can see it the moment it gets out in the sunshine.  The modern clearcoat in the Light Pewter Metallic paint has given this color the kind of depth it could never have when new.  Plus, it makes the perfect backdrop for the black trim to standout.  There's no better way to showcase a Mach 1 than with the NACA ram air hood treatment and side hockey stick stripes.  And we know you love the sporty extras like the black front air dam, rear spoiler, and the rear window slats.  And while the silver paint looks terrific, there's still room for standout brightwork on the bumpers, window trim, and gas cap.  The aggressive and shiny attitudes perfectly come together on the iconic Mag wheels with pony center caps.  ", "  A black interior is always welcomed on a muscle machine like this, and we especially like it more when it matches the exterior accent color.  Plus, the door panels, carpeting, and headliner appear new to really keep a crisp, dark atmosphere.  Ford also wanted a luxury image for the Mach 1, and so this one still retains its high-back bucket seats as well as the button-style plush door panels.  We like how this one keeps plenty of its original spirit.  So not only are all the factory gauges clean and clear, but also many of the details are still working correctly like the dome light and AM radio.  But one upgrade we can all enjoy is modern ice-cold R134a air conditioning.  ", "  Under the hood is exactly what you want to see, a 351 cubic-inch V8.  This one looks nice with details like its chrome air cleaner and finned valve covers, but more importantly, it has all the right upgrades for performance and reliability.  It starts with an Edelbrock four-barrel, carburetor, Edelbrock aluminum intake, and long tube headers.  This creates extra power and plenty of rumble for the dual exhaust.  Plus, thoughtful features like the Griffin aluminum radiator and flex fan help keep everything cool even when the A/C is pumping.  This dual sporty and comfortable nature is seen throughout the driving experience.  For example, the C6 three-speed automatic transmission is stout enough to handle power driving, but it also instantly settles into easy cruising.  Add in great anytime features like power steering and front disc brakes, and you've got an unbeatable package.  ", "  There has been a serious investment in keeping this Mach 1 so nice, and we have the build receipts and maintenance records to prove it.  Don't let this silver bullet slip through your fingers.

In 1971 the Ford Mustang received the most transformative styling update in the car's six year history. The cars became longer, lower, and wider, with a look that remains unique to this day. A combination of lower height, wider track, and a suspension able to take advantage of radial tires resulted in a fine handling car. In addition, the longer wheelbase of these cars gives them a smoother ride. Our Ginger Metallic (5H) 1972 Mustang convertible is a fine example of this body style. One of only 309 '72 convertibles with this color and trim, she appears to be a largely original survivor with the exceptions being a respray in the original color and a few tasteful upgrades. The original drivetrain consists of a 302 V8 backed by a smooth shifting automatic transmission. Mach 1 stripes, front spoiler, matching body side moldings, and a Mach 1 rear wing were added. Factory comfort and convenience features include power steering, power front disc brakes, air conditioning, AM/FM stereo, and the previously mentioned automatic transmission. Cruise control and intermittent windshield wipers have been added. The interior is in great shape, with good upholstery, carpet, and trim. Finally, a set of Magnum 500 wheels wrapped in B.F. Goodrich Radial T/A tires give the car a perfect stance. A very nice example of a very comfortable convertible. Street Dreams is a full service dealership that can assist with worldwide delivery, insurance, and financing options.

We scour the country for vintage cars and trucks and we rarely come across one like this! You must see and drive this rare Mustang!  HISTORY  From 1967 until 1973, the Mustang got bigger but not necessarily more powerful. The Mustang was facelifted, giving the Mustang a more massive look overall and allowing a big block engine to be offered for the first time. Front and rear end styling was more pronounced, and the \"twin cove\" instrument panel offered a thicker crash pad, and larger gauges. Hardtop, fastback and convertible body styles continued as before. Around this time, the Mustang was paired with a Mercury variant, called the Cougar, which used its own styling cues, such as a \"cougar's head\" logo and hidden quad headlamps. New safety regulations by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for 1967 included an energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way emergency flashers, a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system, and softer interior knobs.

", "  A red '65 Mustang is the all-American dream car.  But this one seems to have just a little more flair.  Not only does the factory-correct Rangoon Red look nice, but also this coupe was given some great GT styling cues.  We all love upgraded front grille with the fog lamps and the rear valence with dual exhaust trumpets poking through.  More than just these speedy touches, this car has appeal because it gets the fundamentals correct.  The brightwork is complete and shining; the body gaps are good and uniform; and everything looks correct, right down to the factory wheel covers with Mustang center caps.  ", "  The first thing that welcomes you when you open the door are the plush red vinyl bucket seats.  Not only does the darker red look great against the bright red exterior, but also it has an attractive premium style.  This includes the desirable Pony package that adds an upgraded luxury interior with the prancing horses embedded into the seats.   The three-spoke sports steering wheel gives you an excellent view of five-dial gauge panel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another great GT-style upgrade.  In fact, nice subtle upgrades are part of this interior's theme.  It's how you get features like the wood paneling on the dash, an oil pressure auxiliary readout, and an AM/FM/cassette stereo that has a digital tuner but looks like the factory unit.  ", "  The engine bay has some nice period-correct features like the golden air topper and valve covers, as well as the Mustang's coolant reservoir bag.  But more than just the details, we know you'll like that this one has Ford's trusty 289 under the hood.  The V8 has a two-barrel carburetor, which goes nicely with the added growl of the newer dual exhaust.  Add in a three-speed automatic transmission for easy cruising, and this pony car is a great anytime driving choice.  ", "  Iconic lines, great features, and an affordable price.

It might seem like there's a big catch to a great price on a true American icon, but the more you read, the more you'll just see it's an amazing deal on a well-presented F-code V8 Mustang.  ", "  This is truly a prized possession for a Mustang fan.  After all, the getting your hands on the first batch of this legendary car is a special club that gets more limited every year.  But more than just history, you want this one for how well it's presented. Rangoon Red is such a great way to represent the first-run of the original pony car.  And this one has the added distinction and sophistication of a white vinyl roof.  You can tell this coupe has received the right care and investment over the years.  That's why the bumpers and taillight bezels keep it shining at their best.  And this one has really stayed true to its roots, right down to those great styled steel wheels with the Mustang logo in the middle.   ", "  Inside, the black vinyl shows more evidence that this coupe has always been treated with the respect it deserves.  This looks great against the deep black in the door panels, carpeting, and headliner.  But this isn't a full midnight appearance.   Plenty of bright trim and exterior-matching red give this a very nice atmosphere.  And while the three-spoke steering wheel and gauge package are pure vintage Mustang, there are some great upgrades that make this the perfect vintage cruiser.  After all, we know you'll appreciate the AM/FM/cassette stereo and ice-cold modern R134a air conditioning.  ", "  When you open the hood, the bright Edelbrock valve covers and air topper grab your attention, but it's what's beneath them that's really special.  This is an F-code Mustang, which means it came from the factory with a 260 cubic-inch V8.  Once the 1964.5 production switched over to 1965, this option was gone.  So it's a cool piece of history to have this correct displacement still under the hood.  The same goes for the generator.  After all, it could easily be switched to an alternator, but it has been kept in this one all these years because Mustang people know to look for this special short-run feature.  And you know this has been a cherished classic by the proper maintenance in the engine bay and how nicely that V8 fires up.  Out on the road, features like the power steering and the three-speed automatic transmission mean you can comfortably drive this benchmark classic to all the shows you want.  ", "  Complete with owner's manual, you're looking at an in-demand piece of automotive history that also happens to be a great all-around driving classic.  So at a price like this, you know you need to hurry to grab this deal.  Call today!!!"], "seller_name": "Streetside Classic Cars", "title": "1965 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "714 .
