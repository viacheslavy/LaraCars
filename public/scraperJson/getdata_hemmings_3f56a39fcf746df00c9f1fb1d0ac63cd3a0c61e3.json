The results exceeded their expectations, actually staving off Porsche's plan to replace the 911 just a few years later, as the renewed popularity of the model made the change a clearly unwise move. This 1981 Porsche 911SC, with only about 60,000 miles under its belt and harboring a clean history report in its glove box, is a sterling example of German automotive engineering that's sure to provide its next owner with miles of driving exhilaration.", "This SC looks every inch the able bodied, upgraded sports car it was intended to be. Take a look at it from the front, and you're likely to notice its widened track - directly borrowed from the Carreras of the time. Step to the back and you'll see its signature wing jutting out to provide the downdraft that makes this already formidable corner carver stick even more tenaciously to the asphalt around turns. Despite its more than 35 years on the road, this 911 remains very solid and straight - the gaps separating its doors from the fenders in front and back are very consistent, and its front and rear bumpers sit nice and level, with black rubber that remains unscuffed. It's always reassuring to hear a rattle-free ''thud'' as you close the door upon entering the cockpit and that's just what you'll find here, as well. The sunroof is a great feature - especially on sunny days - and it's functioning in top form.", "Just climbing inside to take your place behind the wheel makes you feel like a practiced high-performance driver. It's a great environment you'll find here, with a pair of black leather buckets that have held up very well and remain comfortable and supportive, and a rear seat area that shows very little use at all. From the looks of things, driver and passengers alike have exercised some caution during journeys, as the door panels look nice and fresh on both sides and still sit flush to their steel frames, the dash area shows no evidence of any mishaps, and the power windows raise and lower smoothly. The VDO gauges residing in the instrument cluster remain clear and readable. The only exception to the consistently stock condition you'll find inside is a great add-on - an AM/FM/CD player sitting front and center in the dash to look after your audio needs while on the road. The storage area up front is surprisingly spacious and as clean as you could want - even with the steel brace residing inside to add to body rigidity, there's an appreciable amount of luggage space.", "You'll find a 3.0 liter 6 cylinder sitting underneath the hood in back that's still at the top of its game. Porsches are known for their longevity - especially when compared to other performance-centric brands - and this powerplant, being so lightly traveled, is very much in its prime, starting up quickly and running great. It's paired with a 5-speed manual transmission to provide just the ''hands-on'' driving experience you'd want in a car like this. Featuring high-revving performance to go along with its timeless looks, this quintessential German sports car sits on a set of 16'' black polished Porsche wheels that carry Yokohama tires.", "With its coveted combination of collectible cachet and exhilarating, road-ready performance, this 1981 Porsche 911SC would be an outstanding centerpiece for any enthusiast's garage.
