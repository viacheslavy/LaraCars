Thoroughly documented Derby Bentley with excellent ownership history and frame-off restoration in the 1990s. Fantastic high-speed tour car ready to enjoy!", "This particular Bentley 4-door saloon was a catalog model with a body by Park Ward, long a Rolls-Royce partner in the finest tradition. Sweeping fenders, a hood that appears to be as long as a city block, and a handsome bustle-back trunk with rear-mounted spare make the car look as if it's in motion, pushing forwards against the wind. This car received a comprehensive frame-off restoration that included a bare-metal respray in the 1990s, and the complementary two-tone beige and cream coachwork highlights the subtle elegance of the design. Among its many wonderful features are a sliding sunroof, massive Bentley headlights and a traditional chrome grille with Flying B hood ornament, and retractable trafficators in the B-pillars, pre-dating Buick's adoption of turn signals in the US in 1939. All four doors close with a reassuringly solid THUNK, the hood swings on well-oiled hinges, and the car feels robust as it goes down the road. All the chrome trim, and there's a surprising amount of it, was refinished to show standards and still looks fantastic today. Yes, the car has been extensively driven and toured, but that's the point of owning a Bentley and I'll wager that if you contact most owners of the Bentley Driver's Club, they'll say that a little bit of road wear is a badge of honor, not a demerit.", "Front seat occupants are treated to a pair of supportive buckets that wrap around your shoulders, almost as if they were anticipating energetic driving in the car's future. Fragrant tan leather hides are used throughout and they have acquired a pleasant patina that only leather can provide, inviting without being tired. There's natural burled walnut everywhere you look, from the window sills to the dashboard, which is filled with dials, switches, and knobs for the driver. The original instruments are all fully functional, including the tachometer (or rev-counter in the familiar parlance), and show bright markings and clear lenses after all these years. In back, you'll be pleasantly surprised by the space available. Clever footwells offer the legroom of a much larger car, so it's easy to get comfortable if you're under about six feet tall. The trunk is large and nicely shaped, and this particular car includes a pair of fitted suitcases for travelling, which still leave room for additional baggage. It also carries its original hub wrench, jack handle, and tool roll, although the tools are now stored in a very tidy panel built into the passenger's front kick panel. There's also a small canister full of replacement light bulbs.", "Rolls-Royce engineers wasted no time adding horsepower to the Bentley, punching out the former 3.6 liter inline six to 4.25 liters, which also increased top speed from 90 to 96 MPH. There's a massive intake silencer on top and the most wonderful array of tiny bell cranks and levers to manage the controls on the steering wheel. Twin ignition coils are of a modern type for reliability (the originals are notoriously prone to overheating and failure) and the voltage regulator is a cleverly hidden Delco unit (likewise), but those appear to be the lone modifications to the original spec. Both fuel pumps on the cowl operate correctly (it's actually one fuel pump with two separate motors) and all of the wiring and plumbing in the car was replaced during the restoration. Richen the mixture as suggested on the steering wheel, add some throttle, and hit the starter button and the big six barks to life with ease and settles into a smooth 900 RPM idle. Once it's warm, you can kick it down even more, where it will happily sit in the heat without getting fussy at all.", "On the road the machinery is just brilliant, with smooth clutch take up and well-chosen gears in the 4-speed manual gearbox, so the car can pull through them without interrupting the smooth flow of torque. Acceleration feels effortless in almost any gear and it cruises comfortably at modern highway speeds. Leather gaiters are wrapped around the springs to keep them from squeaking and getting dirty, and there are powerful finned drum brakes at all four corners. The exhaust system uses no fewer than three separate mufflers to get the perfect sound, and it's worth noting that the entire setup was crafted from stainless steel by Borla, a project that cost more than $2000 all by itself. Painted wire wheels are an elegant choice and they are wrapped in recent 6.50-18 Firestone blackwall tires that look appropriate.", "Documentation includes extensive historical information including original sales information, service records, and information cards, all put together in a bound volume. Since completion, the car has been a frequent participant in club events and long-distance tours and appeared as the cover car for the Derby Bentley Society's publication \"On The Road.\"", "This is a fantastic opportunity to own a sorted, ready to enjoy Derby Bentley with dramatic bodywork at a very appealing price. If you're already a Bentley enthusiast, there's little more that I can tell you. If, however, you're new, you will find this to be a wonderful example that needs little more than a new owner to be enjoyed.

Spectacular frame-off restoration several years ago, still in outstanding condition. Powerful, fast, comfortable, ready to tour or show.", "This spectacular CD8 roadster is one of those late-production Series III cars, offering all the upgrades including the 282 cubic inch engine and 4-speed manual transmission, as well as standard Chrysler features like those powerful hydraulic brakes. It shouldn't be any wonder that cars like this were favorites for stock car racing and a similar roadster even appeared at LeMans. Agile handling, a low center of gravity thanks to the dramatic Al Leamy styling, and the powerful straight-8 made it a formidable car on the track and a delight to drive on the road.", "The restoration is a few years old, but it's quite accurately done and wears its original color combination of Timber Beige with Deerfield Brown moldings and fenders, along with Omaha Orange wheels, and it looks just spectacular today. Dual sidemounts and a trunk rack add to the upscale air that was Chrysler's target market, and there's just not one single line that's out of place. Finish quality is excellent and it shows minimal wear since it was completed, although the passage of time produces some inevitable micro-blisters that are visible upon very close inspection. The doors and rumble seat lid fit well and close on well-oiled hinges, the hood swings open easily, and details such as the matching Omaha Orange pinstripes add a dashing bit of flair. There's simply no angle from which this car isn't beautiful. The chrome remains in excellent condition throughout with no issues.", "The interior is gorgeous brown leather, but calling it \u201cbrown\u201d seems to be selling it short. Simple door panels with map pockets, nicely fitted carpets with custom floor mats, and a nice ribbon of leather around the dash make it feel well-tailored and speak to the quality of the restoration. There's a full array of white-faced gauges in the center of the dash and they're all functional, and we have every reason to believe that the 60,832 miles showing on the speedometer are authentic. The tan canvas top folds easily and the rear window curtain is removable to provide pleasant flow-through ventilation on warm days when too much sun with the top down would be uncomfortable. There's also a matching tan canvas boot. The rumble seat, as I mentioned, is beautifully finished and includes small storage compartments on either side and a surprising amount of legroom, complements of the CD8's lengthy 124-inch wheelbase.", "As the final iteration of the CD8, this roadster received the larger 282 cubic inch straight-8 which makes right around 100 horsepower. It's a traditional flathead design with a downdraft carburetor, and it does indeed use a mechanical fuel pump to ensure reliability even when it's hot. It's beautifully sorted, as it fires to life easily within a few turns and settles into an even idle without the need for choke or other coaxing. There's a pleasing mechanical whirr from under the hood and a nice 8-cylinder grumble from the single exhaust pipe out back, connecting you to the car rather than isolating you from it. There are some minor signs of use on the engine, as this is a favorite tour candidate, but beyond some heat-related paint issues on the exhaust manifold, it's extremely tidy under the hood. It's not quite detailed for show, but it's better than most of the cars you see on tours.", "Chrysler also offered a 4-speed manual transmission, which you'll find in this car. In truth, it's nothing like the 4-speeds of the muscle car era, and what it really is, is a 3-speed with a choice of two first gears. There's an ultra-low first gear and a regular first gear that you'll use 99% of the time. The shift pattern is standard 3-speed manual, although the first gear slot branches into two separate gears, including the ultra-low creeper gear. Out back, it uses period-typical 4.10 gears but thanks to the smooth straight-8, it's happy to cruise at 50-55 MPH without much effort. The chassis is like the engine bay, nicely detailed but showing signs of use, which only means that this Chrysler is fully sorted and ready to enjoy. The suspension is comfortable and capable, making the roadster feel agile instead of clumsy, and Chrysler's hydraulic brakes are quite modern in their feel and remarkably powerful, so the car feels confident on the road. Wire wheels really dress the car up and are fitted with Lester wide whitewall tires that have plenty of life left in them.", "Beauty, speed, quality; this Chrysler embodies them all. For a high-speed tour vehicle it's a superb choice and it's stunning good looks will earn it a place on any show field. With only a handful known to exist, this is an excellent opportunity to own one of the very best to come to market in years.

Beautiful restoration in early 2000s, still very, very sharp. Original color combination, options, and specifications. All original sheetmetal. High-quality V-code 'Cuda, ready to rock!", "This 'Cuda is a really impressive car from any angle. It was restored in the early 2000s and hasn't been driven much, but that's OK because the preservation is quite impressive. We can detect no replacement sheetmetal or patch work under the glowing FE5 Rally Red paint and this car fits together better than any Chrysler product of the 1970s ever did sitting on the factory floor. Reviewing the fender tag, which you'll note is full of options, shows that this car was restored to factory specs, including the rather rare Elastomeric front bumper, which is color-matched to the bodywork. There's no sneaking around, because Rallye Red is brilliant and bright, something that many might call \"Arrest Me Red.\" It's just beautifully done and you can see in the reflections that the bodywork is laser straight and someone invested a serious amount of time during the block sanding and buffing stages to get the surface to reflect just right. But it isn't just red\u2014this car carries the sport hood with simulated air scoops, hood pins, and black \"hockey stick\" stripes on the quarters with '440' callouts that advertise that there's serious blasting powder under the hood. This car is cosmetically excellent and looks right from any angle.", "The interior is likewise nicely restored to factory specs and again, you can see where Chrysler took notes on the competition and turned things up a notch. Settling into the high-back bucket seats is easy, yet the car is notably lower than its competition. There's a handsome wood-rimmed steering wheel that matches the appliques on the dash and center console and provides a consistency with the \"Slap Stick\" shifter. Big, round gauges monitor all the vitals and it includes a factory tach. The upholstery was all new when the car was restored and shows virtually zero evidence of use or age, including the carpets that are protected by matching embroidered floor mats. The dash pad is original (the repros are easy to spot) and isn't cracked and even the door panels remain in first-rate shape. The interior was extensively insulated with Dynamat before the interior went in, so it's surprisingly quiet and comfortable at speed. Even the trunk was fully lined before the reproduction mat was installed. It isn't quite OEM-looking, but you'll be glad it's there.", "Now about that V-code engine. It's a correct 440 HP2 block rebuilt to Six Pack specification and nicely detailed for a factory look. It has an awesome idle that sounds predatory and the three two-barrel Holleys under the air cleaner are well tuned, so it starts easily, idles nicely, and pulls like a freight train when you open all six barrels. The whole thing was bathed in proper Hemi Orange paint and dressed up with reproduction decals for a correct look. It does sport a deep-sump oil pan and pair of ceramic-coated long-tube headers that bolster torque production (as if this engine needs any help in that department), plus a 3-inch Flowmaster exhaust system that sounds heroic. Like I said, this car was not built for stealth.", "This car originally came with a stout 727 Torqueflite 3-speed automatic transmission, so that's what's in place today. Thanks to a shift kit and a modestly upgraded torque converter, it's incredibly responsive and lunges off the line, snapping off crisp upshifts at speed. Out back there's a tough 8.75-inch rear end with what we believe are 3.54 gears inside. You will find no rust, no floor patches, and super solid torque boxes for the rear springs, suggesting that while this car was built for combat, it seldom saw any. Factory Rallye wheels look great and carry staggered 225/70/15 front and 255/60/15 rear BFGoodrich T/A radials.", "Any E-body Mopar is going to be popular, but when it's a genuine V-code Six Pack 'Cuda, you know you've found something special. As one of only 853 built, it remains exceedingly rare, but still very usable and reasonably affordable for an A-list piece of Mopar muscle.

Fully documented, never raced, fully serviced, ready to rock. 427 LSX engine, automatic, cage, full competition suspension. Factory-built 9-second race car, ready to run right out of the box.", "Modern COPOs are not street legal, do not have odometers or titles, and their VINs are little more than ceremonial, strongly suggesting that GM does NOT want you taking them on the street. This is a race car, no two ways about it, and it is built to run with the nastiest hardware on the planet. This particular 2013 COPO is number 53 out of 69 built that year, powered by an LS7-based 427 cubic inch V8 and equipped with race-ready parts that will put you on the track immediately. It has just delivery miles (there is no odometer, so there's really no way to know) and has never been driven in anger down the track\u2026or anywhere else for that matter. It is as-new in every sense of the word.", "The Silver Ice Metallic paint is one of four colors available on the COPO and looks appropriately sinister on the Camaro's distinctive sheetmetal. GM starts with a body-in-white, meaning just a bare shell, and diverts the COPOs to a special assembly line where they are hand-built to standards that far exceed production line stuff. They skip the sound-deadener, the extra wiring for all the accessories, and add a full roll cage that's NHRA legal\u2014all things that are problematic to achieve if you're doing it yourself. Paint and bodywork are production-grade, so it looks like a finished car, and with the towering cowl-induction hood and fat slicks out back, its intentions are clear. COPO stickers on the hood advertise the 427 living inside, but that's the only ornamentation on the car\u2014even most of the badges are shaved in the interest of saving weight. You'll note details like the base-model headlights instead of the usual HIDs, decorative but non-functional fog lights, and a kill switch built into the rear bumper. This is a race car and they don't want any case of mistaken identity here. That's just too cool.", "Clamber over the full 6-point cage and settle into one of the deeply bolstered racing bucket seats and you'll find it's surprisingly comfortable. Some of the surroundings are familiar: the steering wheel is standard Camaro, as are the gauges (although you'll note there is no odometer). Others are pure race-grade, including the big Auto Meter monster tach with shift light and the row of auxiliary gauges taking up residence where the Camaro's A/C vents used to life. Heck, there's not even an ignition key, just a set of switches in the radio's slot that manage the electric fuel pump, ignition system, cooling fan, and electric water pump. There's also a big Hurst Quarter Stick shifter right on the transmission tunnel, complete with line lock release. Obviously there's no back seat, but it is neatly finished and details like a full headliner, door panels, and carpets at least lend the illusion of it being civilized. It is not, don't worry. Pull the hidden trunk release in the original fuel filler door and you'll find a 10-gallon fuel cell dropped into the spare tire well, a heavy-duty battery, and aircraft-grade plumbing.", "The flyweight body shell would be nothing without some thunder to fling it down the track, and the COPO delivers with 427 cubic inches in the form of a LSX block similar to that used in the Corvette Z06, complete with 6-bolt mains. To set it up for the rigors of drag racing, it's been topped by a Holley Pro-Jection EFI system on an intake that simulates a vintage tunnel ram. The GM ignition system is plenty robust, so the coil packs are OEM.  Inside, there are 13:1 compression slugs, a Callies 4340 billet \u201cDragonslayer\u201d crank, Callies forged steel rods, and a set of Mahle forged aluminum pistons\u2014you are NOT going to break this one. A very stout hydraulic roller cam manages the valvetrain, which is, of course, high-grade and ready for action, including roller rockers, titanium valves, and \u201cbeehive\u201d valve springs. Aluminum LS7 heads have been CNC ported to maximize flow from the massive intake and there's a 7-quart fabricated aluminum oil pan to keep it all lubricated properly. Feeding the beast is a competition-grade fuel system with an Aeromotive \u201cEliminator\u201d fuel pump, custom pressure regulator, and high-flow injectors. The cooling system consists of a massive radiator, a Meziere billet electric water pump, and an equally giant electric fan so it's cool in the staging lanes. Stainless American Racing headers with 2-inch primaries handle the exhaust\u2014that's right, there's no exhaust system, just open headers. This thing sounds SPECTACULAR.", "The rest of the driveline is also built for the rigors of going fast, starting with a familiar GM PowerGlide 2-speed automatic that's been prepped and built just for the COPO by ATI Performance Products. There's a deeper pan, a custom torque converter, and a manual valve body so you do need to pay attention when you're running the COPO. A custom 4-inch aluminum driveshaft spins a Strange Engineering Ford 9-inch that has been heavily reinforced and filled with 4.29 gears on a spool. The front suspension is a featherweight setup with custom control arms and a manual steering rack, plus a set of featherweight Wilwood disc brakes. In back, there's the usual 4-link setup with a Panhard rod and a set of adjustable coil-over shocks. It sits on expensive Bogart aluminum wheels wrapped in big-n-little Hoosier meats.", "We have every piece of paper that came with this car, including all the manuals for the various components, the fuel injection programming system CD, the build manifest, NHRA certification paperwork, fabrication check sheets, and more.", "The fact that General Motors is building a turn-key race car that is competitive right out of the trailer is absolutely astonishing. It uses the best of the best components and is built in limited quantities to ensure both competitive racing and exclusivity. Like I said, either you're ready to hit the track or you've got a COPO-shaped hole in your collection\u2014either way, this car is ready.
