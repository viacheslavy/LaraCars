General Motors, and Chevrolet in particular, had three of the best years in their history from 1955 to 1957. GM's passenger car styling set a post-war high water mark that is still written about today, and their trucks benefitted as well. With their hooded headlights and wraparound windshields, these trucks became instant classics that remain wildly popular today the world over. This sharp-looking Pinecrest Green '56 Chevy 3100 showcases this styling nicely, with good paint, chrome, and glass. She's powered by a Chevy 350 sporting a GM aluminum intake manifold, headers, and HEI and the finned valve covers and matching air cleaner for the old school look. Other tasteful upgrades include a 700R4 automatic overdrive transmission, Mustang II front clip with rack and pinion steering, tubular A-arms,  Vintage Air air conditioning, power steering, Autometer and Sunpro gauges, a banjo steering wheel, stereo, and billet handles for windows and doors.  She features brand new 16 inch wide white wall radials on steelies.  The bed is all custom stained to look 100 years old.  Great truck here to enjoy. This is an attractive, fun, and practical machine that's also a milestone for post-war American styling. Street Dreams is a full service dealership that can assist with worldwide delivery, insurance, and financing options."], "Mileage:": "7038"}},

After all, the way the orange blends into the white takes a very professional hand.  Up front we love how the orange is used to patina the grille and highlight the power domes of the hood.  It uses the naturel lines of the profile to help divide the two colors on the sides, and then takes its time on tailgate to really show you what a cool fade can be.  It's all quite creative.  Even the real wood truck bed gets in the two-tone action with orange securing rails within the white-walled bed.", "Inside is more custom two tone.  There was a nice investment in a custom vinyl bench seat, and this is the only place that officially declares its love for the Vols.  And the way the door panels, dash, roof, and steering column all intertwine with orange and white is downright attractive.  This truck comes with all the right features that you would install yourself.  This ranges from the B&M floor shifter, to retro-style AM/FM stereo that can adapt to more modern music players.  You get an upgraded sports steering wheel, and beyond that is the classic fan-style Chevy speedometer.  And while that looks great in this '57, the trio of auxiliary gauges is quite handy to keep you in touch with what's going on under the hood.", "The orange engine bay has been upgraded with small block power.  The 305 cubic-inch V8 looks nicely dressed with Edelbrock air topper and valve covers.  But more importantly, Edelbrock also provided the performance four-barrel carburetor.  Not only does this V8 inhale deeply, but also it exhales with authority as the performance headers that feed a newer stainless glasspack-style dual exhaust.  You get the best control over this enhanced V8's powerband thanks to an adjustable stall converter on the three-speed automatic transmission.  On the road, you're going to love how this classic feels with upgrades such as the Mustang II-style independent front suspension, power steering, and front disc brakes.  This modern cruising package is finished off with large 18-inch OE Racing alloys with grippy Falken tires at each corner.", "This truck will impress you with its quality and custom work.  So the value price is just the cherry on top.  A deal like this is always goes quickly, so call today!"], "Exterior:": "White", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "10015"}},

It began in 1956 where it came from the factory with a 265 v8 with a 4 speed and it was dark green and was radio delete.  It was rescued in a barn in 2012 and made its way to Alabama.  The truck was nearly rust free to begin with and the original cab, fenders, rocker panels, interior floor and hood were used.  The owner adder the spears from a 1957 hood because he liked the look of them.  The entire truck was torn apart and dismantled and then sandblasted and prepared for paint.  It was put in primer and block sanded numerous times.  After much consideration a power plant was chosen.  The truck was fitted with an LS1 5.7L Corvette engine and pulls about 350 HP with a 4L60E computer controlled transmission.  Up next for attention was the frame.  It was given a TCI suspension and included Mustang 2 rack and pinion, tubular upper and lower control arms, and sway bars with disc brakes.", "After the suspension was built and checked to be sure all was square, the chassis was again disassembled and all parts as well as the frame went for powder coating using grey speckled effect.  The stock frame was used and it was boxed.  The factory straight axle was replaced and given a Nova 8.5 rear axle with 342 gears and new leaf springs replaced the original rear end, making the front and rear tracking the same.  The truck was sprayed with many coats of base coat clear coat Guards Red, 1970 Porsche code 027.  The truck was given an aluminum radiator and the battery was relocated.  The bed was finished with red oak stain over oak wood with 7 coats of Spar Marine Clear and shines at a very high gloss.  The strips that separate the oak planks are also wood, doing away with the look of chrome strips.  The truck was given a fuel cell under the bed near the rear.    The interior was finished in white and tan leather and shows very well.  This 3100 was given power windows and given a big back window instead of the small standard glass.  Upon re-assembly it was given vintage air and was installed and all new chrome and lights were used.  A new sound system was installed with a retro radio as well.  There are speakers installed in the kick panels.  It was given Omega gauges as well.  A bed from 1968 was used, which was the first year a fleetside was offered.  The truck has power brakes, power steering and a tilt steering wheel.  The wheels are American Racing 17x7 torque thrust with a 5:43/4 bolt pattern.", "To see over 80 photos of this car, including under carriage please visit our website www.grautogallery.com", "Gr Auto Gallery, LLC and our sister company, Wheelz Sales and Leasing Inc. makes every effort to represent each vehicle accurately and with integrity.

In what amounted to a systematic, high-dollar rebuild, its solid body was completely stripped, tastefully modified and layered in a sweet combination of green fleck and silver fleck 2-stage.

At the front of the truck, a polished bumper founds a polished grille between frenched parking lamps and chrome-trimmed tri-bar headlights. Behind that grille, a shaved hood leads the eye to smoked glass, which floats between shaved drip rails, chrome-capped wipers and sleek hot rod mirrors. Opposite that roof, a shaved profile centers custom flames between a frenched antenna and low-profile exhaust tips.

At the top of that fully sorted mill, a Weiand Hi-Tek air cleaner funnels wind in to a coated Holley carburetor, which seats a small Summit pressure gauge between polished and braided fuel lines. Beneath the blower, a polished intake perfectly complements polished and milled valve covers, which hang polished breathers and trick wingnut ties over lightweight Edelbrock Performer heads. Behind those breathers, a modern HEI distributor shoots spark through loomed Taylor Spiro Pro plug wires. At the front of those looms, bright serpentine components spin a polished water pump beneath a polished alternator and polished AC compressor. In front of those ancillaries, a green core support hugs a beefy Be Cool radiator, which plays well with two corrugated hoses, a polished expansion tank and two electric puller fans. And, despite being a thoroughly massaged piece, the mean, green mill looks right at home in the truck's spotless, silver engine compartment.", "DRIVETRAIN/SUSPENSION", "One peek under this sweet pickup reveals solid bones that were built to cruise.

Tracking is provided by an independent front-half, which features modern power steering. Braking is equally class, with a floor mounted booster charging green calipers and drums. Coated Hedman Hedders dump spent gases in to 2.5-inch pipes, which breathe through throaty Flowmaster mufflers. As with the truck's body and engine, detailing is on point, with a stainless fuel tank and polished oil pan complementing a polished flywheel shied and polished transmission pan.

At the bottom of that console, leather sills frame lit carpet, which rides under billet foot pedals.
