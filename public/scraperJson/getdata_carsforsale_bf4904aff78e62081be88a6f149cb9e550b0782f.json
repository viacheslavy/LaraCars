This 1967 coupe is a lovely car that's a pleasure to drive and delivers a fun V8 Mustang experience that you'll definitely appreciate once you get behind the wheel.  ", "  The Mustang's success was based primarily on its ability to be almost all things to all people, and coupes like this one were the reason why the less profitable and more expensive Mach 1s and Shelbys could exist. Nicely presented, the body is straight with no major signs of repair through the years. The bright Springtime Yellow finish looks authentic and shows a few signs of use and age but nothing that would stop you from jumping in and going for a ride. There are a few touch ups and we do like the recently-installed black stripes along the rocker panels that coordinate well with the matching black vinyl top.  Details are correct throughout, including the grille, emblems, and trademark Mustang gas filler cap out back. Chrome on the bumpers is very nice, and the stainless around the windows has a wonderful patina that looks totally authentic. The aforementioned black vinyl top makes this yellow car look masculine and shows none of the usual signs of trouble underneath. There's no question that this is a very handsome car.  ", "  From behind the wheel, you'll be hard-pressed to determine what's living under the hood, since all Mustangs had beautiful bucket seat interiors. However, this one carries a set of modern chairs that fit so well most folks won't even notice that they're not original equipment. They work well with the new carpet and upscale door panels with woodgrained appliques. The fat steering wheel looks sporty with its three spokes, which also give a great view of the stylish Mustang dashboard full of functional original gauges. Although this car probably came with an AM radio originally, it now carries a Sony AM/FM/CD unit that fits in the original location, so nothing was cut or modified in the process. A slender chrome handle with a wooden knob controls the automatic transmission, and the lack of a console seems to be perfectly appropriate in this pony. You also get factory A/C, which wasn't all that common back in 1967 but is quite welcome here. The trunk is neatly finished with correct mats and a full-sized spare tire with matching cover.  ", "  The engine is a C-code 289 cubic inch V8, which was a popular choice and offered a great balance of power and good manners. Although there's no way to be sure, we're fairly certain this is the car's original engine and it looks quite correct in the Mustang's engine bay with Ford Blue paint, a chrome air cleaner with reproduction decals, and original ignition equipment. It's almost completely stock, which means a thrifty 2-barrel carburetor and standard exhaust manifolds, so it's easy to live with on a daily basis. It's backed by a C4 3-speed automatic that snaps off quick "], "title": "1967 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "24", "price": "19995", "kilometers": 3636.34, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241734", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241734", "year": "1967", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "2,260 miles", "Exterior Color": "Springtime Yellow", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

This 1966 Ford Mustang coupe is an ideal example of doing more with less, and it doesn't need flashy paint or oversized tires to make its statement. Instead, it's a carefully crafted machine that lets the little things do the talking, and once you get a look, I guarantee you'll be impressed.  ", "  The early Mustang is one of the most recognizable cars ever built, so the subtle and elegant look this one carries shouldn't bother anyone. Refinished in a color that's pretty close to Candyapple Red, which is this car's original color, and it looks awesome. Forget fake Shelby stripes, this one makes a statement with straight bodywork, crisp sheetmetal bends, and nice finish work so that you're drawn in to have a closer look. It's got some age and mileage on it today, but there's a lot to love about a Mustang that's been driven and everybody will smile when they see this handsome pony car. Things like the chrome bumpers, stainless window surrounds, and taillights are all stock Mustang items, because good taste never goes out of style, and while the VIN says this is a T-code 6-cylinde car, those '289' emblems on the front fenders aren't just there for show. To be honest, it's kind of refreshing to see a Mustang dressed pretty much as it might have been in, say, 1969 when it was still being used as a regular car, not a collector's item.  ", "  The red bucket seat interior is like the body, almost entirely stock, but with a few smart upgrades that enhance the driving experience. The original buckets have been reupholstered in correct textured red vinyl seat covers with door panels to match, and there are new carpets on the floor. Original gauges are all fully functional, while the radio is a familiar AM unit, but somewhere along the line, someone has thoughtfully added an FM unit under the dash, so you're not stuck with whatever passes for entertainment on AM these days. There is no center console, but the T-shaped shifter for the C4 3-speed automatic looks right sticking out of the neatly upholstered transmission tunnel, just as it would have decades ago. The steering wheel is perhaps a little fatter than the original and there are carpeted floor mats to keep it in top shape. In back, the trunk is finished with an OEM style plaid mat that gives it a correct look.  ", "  Small block Mustangs are a threat on the street thanks to their excellent power-to-weight ratio and rugged hardware, and it's no surprise that someone upgraded from the original inline-six. This 289 has been augmented with things like an Edelbrock carburetor and GM HEI ignition system, and it drives smoothly so you know there are no finicky parts inside. Dress-up includes a set of finned valve covers and a custom air cleaner, as well as Ford Blue engine enamel that is a nod to tradition. It's not detailed for show, but it runs great and a few weekends of work under th"], "title": "1966 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "24", "price": "19995", "kilometers": 156034.384, "total_pages": 2, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27241936", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27241936", "year": "1966", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "289 V8", "Mileage": "96,976 miles", "Exterior Color": "Red", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Red", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},
