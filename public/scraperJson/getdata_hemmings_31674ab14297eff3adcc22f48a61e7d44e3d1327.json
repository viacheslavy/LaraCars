This 1955 Chevrolet 3100 Cameo represented a new direction for generations of pickups to follow, offering a more comprehensive and car-like experience in its interior that would help redefine the pickup genre, as Chevy began to realize that the American car buying public was looking for more than an austere driving environment to go along with solid dependability.", "This 3100 has seen more than six decades of life and remains looking undeniably sturdy and road-ready. It's India Ivory shade is the same color it left the factory with all those years ago and it ably accentuates the truck's strong contours, offering a nice shine in the process. The 3100s of this era have a self-assured, forward-inclined, face-like appearance when viewed from the front, formed by their wide set headlights and prominent grille that give this truck the appearance it's leaning into the task at hand, forehead first, and the well-aligned features on this one make that self-assured determination all the more convincing. Red accenting on the pillars to the rear of the windows provides a custom touch. The rugged front and back bumpers sit properly positioned and level, and you'll find all the external ornamentation, including its headlight casings, chrome trim and badging, intact and securely fastened, though we do think some attention would bring the chrome work to the next level. Take a look in back and you'll see the painted red Chevy bowtie adorning the tailgate - combined with the twin chrome bumper guards sitting below, it provides another nice detail to this very appealing vintage truck.", "The two-toned, ivory and red interior also remains in its original configuration and has been refurbished to an impressive condition. The bench seat is a nice mix of vinyl and cloth that's well padded and comfortable \u2013 flanked by door panels on each side that mimic its textured pattern. Just below, the matching red rubber floor mat appears to have performed its protective function well and shows no major scuffs or tears. In front of the original steering wheel, the dash area has been restored to a clean expanse of two-toned steel, featuring a fan-shaped instrument cluster with a very clear lens, a group of control knobs all properly situated, and the original AM radio. In the only readily noticeable nod to modern convenience, a Vintage Air climate control system sits under the dash to keep you and your passengers comfortable while on the road. The bed area in back carries a matching red color and features straight walls with no protruding wheel wells on its sides - affording substantially more room should you ever wish to have this sturdy truck bear any cargo.", "Under its dominant hood, you'll find a 235 cubic inch inline 6 that's topped with a 2-barrel carb, just as this truck started out with back in the mid-'50s, with an also factory-correct 3-speed manual transmission sitting just behind. It's a drivetrain that's weathered time well, also benefiting from an updated carb and air cleaner so that it's starting right up, idling strong and shifting securely. This classic Chevy workhorse sits on a set of 15'' stock rims, outfitted with vintage white wall tires.", "If you're in the market for a great looking vintage truck that's been kept in stock condition and is running strong, you need to see this 1955 Chevrolet 3100 Cameo pickup.

All the usual tricks work here, and what you get when you're done is a stylish, fun, and surprisingly practical hauler that will attract attention wherever it goes.", "First of all, the two-tone copper over white paint is an eyeball magnet, offering a traditional look with a few tweaks to give it a custom look. It's still got plenty of authenticity, don't worry about losing the truck's personality, but the shaved hood ornament and custom pinstriping on the already clean lines of the all-new 3100 really work well. The bodywork, which was already dramatic right out of the box, looks great wearing that soft white paint, which is a little creamy, not a hard, bright white, just as it might have been back in the day. A lot of the original trim is intact, and the grille, bumpers, and hooded headlights are in pretty good shape, highlighting what's arguably the first high-fashion pickup truck; you can see the ties to the passenger car line everywhere you look and that's purely intentional. The bed is still functional, too, with wood planks that are in just the right condition that you won't worry about throwing some tools back there and getting a job done somewhere. After all, isn't that why you own a pickup truck?", "The interior has been given a full makeover as well, and the working-class accommodations have been replaced by first-class white and copper vinyl. The late-model bench seat looks like a natural fit in the 3100's cab and has been covered with a period-looking pleated upholstery with copper piping, so it all works well together. A custom center console offers a pair of cup holders and holds the Lokar shifter for the TH350 3-speed automatic transmission underneath. Black carpets are the right choice in a truck and keep it from being too soft, and the matching door panels have been as nicely finished as the seat. The stock gauges are still monitoring the engine, along with a white-faced temperature gauge built into the center stack. There is no radio, but it's ready for the entertainment system of your choice, and sometimes starting from scratch is easier than fixing someone else's mess. Finishing it off is a late-model tilt steering column with a rather weathered steering wheel that doesn't quite look right, so that's another place where you could add some value and style without spending much cash.", "Just as in 1955, there's a small block Chevy 350 V8 under the hood delivering the power. It's functional and pretty stock, save for the Edelbrock 4-barrel carburetor and intake manifold, so there's smooth power available and it never gets fussy. Some smart upgrades make it reliable and comfortable, including an alternator, power steering, and a modern dual reservoir power brake master cylinder. A big radiator up front keeps things cool. An independent front suspension gives the 3100 improved ride and handling without hurting its ability to work as a truck and it channels power back to a 10-bolt rear end with highway-friendly gears inside. Long-tube headers and a dual exhaust system dumps out just ahead of the rear wheels and sounds fantastic.

On the inside it has all been redone.  The seat has been recovered in the correct style vinyl.  Also new carpet and a headliner board was installed.  When you look at the dash they replaced the steering column with a brushed aluminum tilt and added a Banjo Wheel.  The factory style gauges were left and they added a set of Pro comp under dash gauges and a tach.  A short console was installed and it houses the Lokar Shifter.", "Finally, we will take a look at heartbeat of the Chevy.  Under the hood the firewall and inner fenders look like the body.  But the power comes from a late model fuel injected 4.8/5.3 Engine that's mated to a 350 Turbo Trans and a 10 Bolt Rear End.  The frame under this Truck is from an S10 with Four Wheel Disc Brakes that are Power along with Power Steering.  The fuel system has been replaced with an Aluminum tank with new lines and pump.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.

This 1946 Chevrolet 3100 pickup truck is a perfect example. At first glance, it's a nicely restored old pickup, but under the hood there's a V8 engine, an automatic overdrive transmission, and all the performance and comfort of a newer machine.", "Bright red paint is always a wonderful choice for an old pickup. We can all envision a truck just like this, which years ago was working in a field with a denim-clad farmer tossing hay bales into the bed. Today it has been restored to better than new condition. A lot of these were worked to death, but this one seems very solid and clean, so it was probably not a farm mule and survived its working years completely intact. '40s pickups have become collector's items in their own right, combining timeless good looks with great drivability, and this one seems to have distilled the essence of that idea into sharper focus. Most of the chrome trim has been retained and looks great, especially with that black trim running along the sides of the hood and cab. The bed is beautifully finished with a varnished wood floor that has a red stain that's pretty darned close to the color of the bodywork, and it looks awesome!", "Inside, the basics are a little less basic than they were in 1946. Although the goal was to make this a truck capable of cruising like a modern vehicle, the builder didn't want to lose the flavor of a vintage machine. So there's a bench seat, still upholstered in simple black vinyl, and the original metal dash has been restored, not modified. However, inside the gauge panel you'll find the original speedometer flanked by modern gauges, which is a neat touch. The big three-spoke steering wheel is original equipment, too, now vanished with a black leather wrap to give it a more luxurious feel, and there are red accents throughout the interior to tie it all together neatly. Carpets replace the original rubber mats and the original under-dash heater remains, a nice nod to the past. There's also an AM/FM radio hidden out of sight and a custom handle on the shifter so it looks like the original 3-speed manual but actually manages a TH400 3-speed automatic transmission.", "The original six-cylinder engine and stump-pulling gears are long gone, replaced by a rebuilt 283 cubic inch V8. However, the goal wasn't tire-shredding horsepower, but rather comfortable cruising without disturbing the character of the original vehicle. In that regard, it is extremely successful. The engine runs without a fuss, inhaling through a 4-barrel carburetor up top and exhaling through a great-sounding dual exhaust system. There's plenty of shiny stuff on the engine, including a stainless firewall, but you can tell that it was built to cruise first and foremost. Up front, the suspension is stock, which means a rigid axle, but it has been upgraded with front disc brakes. A 1963 Nova donated its rear end and it carries a more street-friendly set of gears so this pickup can cruise all day at highway speeds. Chrome Cragar wheels wearing 235/60/15 blackwall radials give it a vintage hot rod look.", "So if you're attracted to an original truck but would like to have one with a wider operating range and the comforts of a modern machine, here you go.
