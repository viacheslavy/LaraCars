Sloppy steering, less than stellar acceleration and a loose, squeaky suspension often come to mind. This 1966 Mustang Restomod is an inspired combination of modern technology with old school motoring vibe, all wrapped in a unique and well-executed package that's sure to turn heads.", "Ford's Lime Gold was a signature color for Mustangs of the late 60's and it's employed to great use in this inspired reimagining that adds a wide swath of black running from front to back over the scooped hood, hardtop and trunk all the way to the taillight panel against that nostalgic backdrop.  It's not just an eye-catching color scheme but it's also very well applied, with a smooth, glass-like finish from all angles. The chrome and trim all over - including the front and back bumpers, light bezels and window trim - all have an unblemished shine. Look closer up front and you'll see a set of fog lights hidden behind that new looking grille. Go around to the back and you'll see a set of clean chrome bezels surrounding the dual exhaust in the rear valance, a very cool finishing touch.", "Once you look inside, the quality and inspired design of this interior are immediately obvious. There are some very cool touches here, as the color scheme of the exterior has been ably brought in: a primarily lime gold dash with black inserts is crowned by a new dashpad, and the lime gold door interiors surround matching black inserts of their own. Look in the back and you'll see another unique touch - the areas straddling the black back bench seat also carry that lime gold hue on their steel surfaces, unobscured by any quarter panel trim inside. The front black buckets and rear bench don't seem to have seen much use at all and their restored design has a very tasteful and comfortable look: aftermarket but very much right at home in this classic. Peer through the custom steering wheel and you'll see a set of aftermarket Dakota gauges fit seamlessly into the stock design of the instrument bezel - a combination of updated technology blended with a vintage look. There are also some great add-ons to improve the driving experience, including a chrome Ididit tilt column and a top-quality Rockford- Fosgate AM/FM system with iPod connectivity powering a set of speakers expertly installed in those front kick panels.", "There's plenty of GO to match the SHOW here. A 347 stroker V8 engine sits as the foundation of the drivetrain and with its Crane Cam and MSD ignition, it's sure to provide all the power you could want. It's paired to a C4 3 speed transmission with highway-friendly 3.08 gears in the back. A generously-sized aluminum radiator sits in front to keep temperatures down and a billet serpentine pulley system adds yet another visual element to a nice clean compartment that features more than its share of them. The addition of a state of the art power rack and pinion steering is a HUGE upgrade over the steering box that came stock in Mustangs of this era, eliminating the slop that was part and parcel of the old design, and the constant need to correct that came with it for a much more precise feel. This Mustang sits on a set of American Racing Wheels with Shelby knockoffs, wrapped in performance radials.", "Looking for a muscle car that combines the best of old school looks with new technology for a great driving experience?
