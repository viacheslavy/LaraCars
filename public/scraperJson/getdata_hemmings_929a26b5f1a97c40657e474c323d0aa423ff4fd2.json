It was aimed towards the enthusiast, and called The Touring Coupe. The car was distinctly different from the other Eldorados. First, there was no hood ornament, but only a cloisonn\u00e9 medallion that says, Touring Coupe and has a very nice Cadillac wreath and crest. Next, no vinyl roof was available, and there were also no whitewall tires or wire wheel covers.  As if that were not enough of a departure from tradition, brightwork and chrome were greatly reduced, and most trim was body colored or blacked out, while ribbed rocker moldings replaced aluminum trim commonly found on these. The interior of The Touring Coupe offered only leather bucket seating featuring lumbar and lateral support along with a center console instead of split bench seating. Relative to performance, the real difference lied under the body, as the Touring Suspension on the car featured larger stabilizer bars front and rear (32mm & 26mm), and twenty percent stiffer front torsion bars, rear coil springs that were fifteen percent firmer, entirely different shocks up front, and recalibrated air lift shocks in the rear. The suspension grommets were of 70-durometer rubber over the 60-durometer rubber on the standard Eldorado. The steering system offered more feedback while keeping a 14:1 ratio and the tires were upgraded to P225/70R15 for increased handling. As the production figures show, there were only 585 Touring Coupes made in 1985 out of a full production run of 76,401 Eldorado's.  Even fewer still exist today!", "I purchased the car a year ago from a collector who was very passionate about his Cadillac and had completed a frame on restoration of nearly the entire car.  He was going through a family problem, and needed to unexpectedly sell the car, hence the reason it was even on the market. I have been very pleased, and the car turns heads everywhere it goes.  It gets a lot more attention than my other Cadillacs.", "When purchased by the former owner, the car came from a clean, dry, Oklahoma environment.  Mileage was low (89,400), and the restoration performed was inspired by the 1981 movie, Thief, with James Caan, where Caan drove a black on black Eldorado. He always loved that movie and the Eldorado that Mr. Caan drove in the movie. He thought, \u201cHow cool would it be to have THAT car!  For that reason, this Eldorado Touring Coupe was the fortunate recipient of a no expense spared restoration!", "Because the former owner was a true automotive enthusiast and an avid car collector, along with a former mechanic and body man, he spent countless hours of his time on this car over a four-year period.  Very quickly a sum of $15,000 cash had been invested to find the needed New Old Stock (NOS) or otherwise original factory parts.  You don't see many 1985 Eldorado's that have been restored. In the process, he decided to change it over to a black interior car making it the only black on black Eldorado Touring Coupe in the world, because it had to match the car James Caan drove in Thief.  Reproduction parts for the cars don't really exist so you don't have many options, and as a result, it took him nearly three years to accumulate all the needed parts to complete his \u201clabor of love\u201d.", "Considering the car's Oklahoma environment from 1985 until 2011, upon the car's arrival to the former owner by trailer in New Jersey it was observed with the car on stands that the entire frame was covered in a fine dust which protected the metal from rust for 30 years. The car was 100% rust free which is unusual for these cars since rust can be a problem.  Because of the immense rarity of the model and the scarcity of restoration parts, it took three other Eldorado Touring coupes and two Eldorado Base models to complete the restoration of this one car, along with the hundreds of new (NOS) parts.  He also found it very hard to find a near mint black interior, the unique rocker panels, and interior center console in acceptable excellent original condition, but he eventually succeeded!", "Due to his perfectionistic tendencies, and given this was a \u201cdream\u201d car for him, he decided to focus on the exterior of the car initially.  Although acceptable in looks, and well kept, he decided it needed a new paint job and proceeded to disassemble the entire car, including trim and bumpers, fillers, etc., and then had a paintless dent removal company come and spend time doing all they could to the car for the minor parking lot dings that were in the sides.  Next, he stripped the entire car to the bare metal, where there was only the factory body putty, and not a sign of any rust.  He then did minor putty work to get the car to look brand new.  It was block sanded and primed three times using epoxy primer, before it was sent to a paint shop specializing in restorations, where it was again primed, sanded, and sealed, before getting refinished in the correct Color Code 41, Sable Black, with clear coat.  The paint does look incredible!  Also, when new, these originally did not come with pin striping or with body side moldings, but both were optional.  The car was restored to look as if new from the factory, and very tastefully done.", "When I finally took delivery of the car, the attention to detail throughout the lengthy restoration was evident, not to mention a box full of receipts and a trunk full of spare parts, and brand new front windshield.  Nearly all exterior trim was replaced with new, along with a new grille and header panel.  The chrome pieces were nice enough to be retained, as was all the window glass, as all the date codes matched the vintage of the car.  Most incredible are the rear taillamp lenses that are new, along with the NOS bumper fillers, front and rear, impossible to find today.  These are much preferred for the original fitment they have, compared to reproduction replacements often of a fiberglass material, that never seem to fit properly.", "Mechanically, the car was almost as good as the cosmetics, as the original Oklahoma owner had arranged in 1998 a new and professionally installed by Cadillac replacement HT4100 engine at approximately 40,000 miles, but that wasn't enough.  On top of this, new intake manifold gaskets, exhaust gaskets, a fuel pressure regulator, fuel injectors, spark plugs, a synthetic oil change, wires, a rebuilt distributor, a water pump, an alternator, an a/c compressor, an accumulator, and a condenser, were added, nearly all of which with NOS parts!  Next, to be sure of reliability, he also had the original radiator re-cored using correct copper core, and all new radiator hoses, heater hoses and new heater core, along with a new battery, new hood insulator, new windshield washer pump, new power steering pump, air pump, and all drive belts.  The unique aluminum wheels were correctly restored and new, and period accurate, black wall tires with white letters were added, too, along with completely new door and window weather stripping, door hinges, and lower hinge pins also replaced to ensure the large, and heavy doors, open and close as they should, and do not sag.", "Moving from the exterior to the interior, this was also completely redone, with new Alcantara headliner and interior sail panels, new carpeting, mint original door panels and dashboard, including a replacement Digital Dash Cluster, (Mileage on the dash does not match actual mileage, as a result) new power window motors and regulators, along with new power door lock motors.  The seat belt webbing is new and factory correct, too, with also NOS floor mats, along with all interior lighting updated and replaced, to be sure all illumination works as it should.  Still too, the leather bucket seats were recovered with a beautiful and correct hide to further enhance the sporty look.", "Upon my receipt of the car in January 2017, it's primarily been a \u201cgarage queen\u201d, having only been driven less than 200 miles the year that I've owned it.  I had intended to take it to car shows, but have very little time due to work, and I'd like the car to go to a home that could enjoy it, versus it just sitting.", "Given the goal was to show the car, and drive it, I wanted to ensure reliability.  We went through the entire engine, resealing everything, at considerable expense.  All work was done at the Cadillac dealer.  All services are up to date, including recent replacement of engine oil, transmission fluid, coolant, power steering and brake fluids, and engine drive belts.  The Air Conditioning System components are new and have been converted to R-134A, and the system performs as new.  Tires and all hoses are new, along with the brake and suspension systems.  The radiator is recored and fully operational as if new. A full tune up has been completed and all filters replaced.  The car is powered by the Cadillac 4.1 L Fuel Injected 8 Cylinder engine, and the car starts and drives very easily, is very quiet with no unusual noises and no leaks.  All of the accessories work as they should, and the power antenna is new, but disconnected.  The aftermarket radio plays via Bluetooth, CD's, via aux cable iPod/Android, MP3's, or radio of course.  It is a Kenwood KDC-BT362U.  (The original Delco radio will go with the car.)", "Inspections are welcome and encouraged, but would need to be scheduled on an appointment basis as the car is in storage currently.  I am a Cadillac & La Salle Club member, and am happy to accommodate any questions, and will also assist with shipping the vehicle as you might need.", "Several hundred detailed photos are available at these links:", "https://app.box.com/s/w3h8hu0flucxqyjtkdz795gqylve0pq2", "https://app.box.com/s/i43nbreacvvw5s0v8dwb24a3y9zfan5p", "There are photos of the inside, outside, engine bay, trunk, undercarriage, and many other details.
