The Giulietta's arrival caused a sensation; demand quickly outstripped supply, causing Alfa Romeo to rethink its production strategy and become a high-volume manufacturer.Designed by Pinin Farina on a modified Sprint Coupe chassis, the Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider was the company's second post-war model. The little two-seat Sports Spider was introduced in 1955 at the insistence of New York importer Max Hoffman, who saw how well small British and German sports cars were being received in America. The Giulietta Spider offered brisk performance (almost 100 mph) from its free-revving, all-alloy, 1.3-liter twin-cam four, mounted in a steel unibody chassis that weighed less than 1900lbs at the curb. The design was unmistakably Pinin Farina \u2013 very elegant, sporting and lithe.From the time of their introduction, both the Sprint and Spider provided an exhilarating combination of character and performance, within the limits of what was possible with the well-designed twin-cam engine. However, as with pre-war Alfa Romeos, the dealers soon saw a demand for an uprated version for buyers with competition in mind. In 1956, the Giulietta Sprint and Spider Veloces duly appeared, with high-performance engines and modified bodywork. High-crown pistons raised the compression ratio to 9.1:1 which, with a pair of twin-choke Weber carburetors and more peaky camshaft profiles, raised the power by about 15%. Performance was certainly improved, with a top speed of 115mph and a more responsive engine through and through. Just 2,796 Giulietta Spider Veloces were produced, and they remain among the most collectible of the model today.This matching numbers example is finished in black over red and is in excellent condition. We are informed that the bright work is in equally good order. Mechanically the car comes with a large history file and is described as being mechanically perfect, with a big service just been carried out as well as chrome.

Alfa's classic twin-cam four was downsized to 1,290ccc for the 750-Series Giulietta, gaining an alloy cylinder block in the process. The Sprint coupe was soon joined by Berlina and Spider versions, the latter styled by Pinin Farina and built on a slightly shorter wheelbase. The Giulietta family's success surprised even Alfa themselves; production targets were revised upwards and to satisfy demands for increased performance, upgraded Veloce versions of the Sprint and Spider were introduced. The combination of a rev-happy engine, fine-handling, responsive chassis and excellent brakes make the Giulietta Sprint a driver's car par excellence and explains why these stylish Alfa Romeos continue to attract the discerning enthusiast today.This charming 1959 example, finished in Alfa Romeo Red with a black interior has come from Sweden, and is offered with certificate di origine. Fitted with a desirable 1600 engine this little alfa will perform as well as it looks.View 1959 Alfa Romeo Giulietta Sprint on 'http://www.coys.co.uk/cars/1959-alfa-romeo-giulietta-sprint' for further details.", "Auction"]}},
