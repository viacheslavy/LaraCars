Motorcar Classics is now selling this 356SC Coupe featured in Ruby Red (6402) with black interior. 1965 was the last year of the 356, and it is estimated that perhaps 330 or so of the 356SC were built that year. The 1965 356 has disc brakes all around and the optional SC has the 95 HP motor, the most powerful pushrod engine yet produced by Porsche. This car has ownership history from new where it was delivered by Bursch Porsche of Pasadena, California. It spend most of its life in dry California and Utah and has a Porsche Certificate of Authenticity to document it. The pan and all panels are original and show no signs of ever having been subject to corrosion or damage. The history file includes much descriptive information about work done on the car various owners and many receipts as supporting documents. In the early 1990s the engine was removed and sent to Andial for a rebuild. While the engine was out work was done including complete replacement of the brake system, new Koni shocks and steering damper, new fuel tank, valve and lines, new swing arm bushings, all new interior and exterior rubbers, new carpet, dash upholstery, rebuilt seats, new shift linkage, muffler, and carbs were rebuilt by Eurometrics. The car has a high-quality respray in the original Ruby Red and it presents to a high standard. It has the original radio, chrome rims, factory optional camber compensating spring, Nardi wood steering wheel and wood shift knob. The period correct luggage rack and coco mats are delightful touches. All the brightwork is in excellent condition and the panel fit, gaps and surfaces are all to Porsches customary premium quality. The car runs and drives as you would expect from a proper 356SC and it has covered only 53,325 miles. It was purchased in Los Angeles by its most recent owner, kept in a climate controlled environment, and driven only a few hundred miles since. This is truly an investment-grade Porsche 356SC that you can drive or show with pride."], "Exterior:": "Ruby Red", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "53325"}},

The previous owner tells us it is a no-hit car with all of its original panels and floor pan. The only thing that needed to be replaced was the battery pan. It has near perfect gaps; the doors make that ''ting'' sound when you shut them; and the proper fit and finish all over this car makes this a rare Pre-A indeed. The tan interior and top are very well done and they remain in excellent condition. The engine currently in the car is a smoked-over 912 with plenty of horsepower to ''get it done'' while a stock engine (60339) is also included. To help the car's drivability a 1958 356 steering box and 15? wheels (16? wheels included) are currently on the car. These tackle the only real faults of a Pre-A, its tractor-like steering and its very narrow tire contact patch on the road. This is a terrific Speedster to enjoy on sunny days, and to satisfy that itch that needs scratching without spending double the money for a concours trailer queen that you won't let the kids near."]}},
