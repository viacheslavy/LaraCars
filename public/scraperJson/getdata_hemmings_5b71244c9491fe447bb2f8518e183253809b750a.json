The door panels are also done in blue and have been replaced, and the headliner is done in white.  Looking at the dash it's done in blue and features the upgraded gauges that are all working.  The radio has been upgraded and the vintage AC is controlled from the factory location.", "Finally, we will get to the heartbeat of the Chevy.  Under the hood is where you are going to fall in love.  With over 550 HP the is one of the most powerful engines GM has ever offered.  The 6.2 Supercharged LSA motor you'll find under the hood of this Chevelle is mated to the Tremec Six Speed and 12 Bolt Posi Rear End.  It's got the cold air breather and it also has an Aluminum Radiator.  Also, it comes with Air Condition, Power Steering and Power Four Wheel Disc Brakes with drilled and slotted Rotors.  When you look under this '66 you'll see front and rear sway bars from Spohn.  Also, the front control arms are Tubular and it has new springs front and rear.  Looking at the floors they have done some work around the tunnel to accommodate the tremec, and the front floor pans have been patched at the front.  The frame all appears solid and in good condition along with the body bushings.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.

They started with a 34 Ford Cab that was chopped 4''.  The frame, Hood and Side Panels are made from flat stock that was worked and rolled to fit.  The side panels had custom inserts to fit around the engine.  For the bed they started with a repop bed that was shortened and has a custom Mercury Tail Gate.  Everything is painted in the Rich Navy Blue that has a deep rich shine and is slick to the touch.  To keep with the old school look the wheels up front are 16x4 from a 40 Ford and the rears are 18x7 custom Circle Racing Wheels with Merc Hub Caps.", "Next, we will take a look at the interior of the '34.  The inside is done in Tan Leather with a bench seat.  All the metal dash is painted body color to create the perfect flow from the exterior to the interior.  It has a 40 Ford Insturment panels and steering column with a 15'' 40 Ford Wheel.  The pedals are by Kugel.  This truck also has the tilt out front windshield.", "Finally, we will take a look at the drivetrain of the Mercury.  Under the custom hood is a '51 Merc Flat Head V8.  It has Eddie Meyer Heads and Intake with Stromberg 97 Carbs.  The trans is a 3 Speed with Over Drive.  The frame is from a 34 Ford that was sectioned 2 \u00bd''  it was also boxed form the firewall back.  Under the front is a So Cal 4'' Drop Axle with 37 Ford Spindles and wish bone.  Under the back is a 39 Zepher Rear Wish Bone.  When you look under this truck it's every bit as clean as the top.", "This is a true one of a kind ride that as we mentioned has Won at Major Shows like Good Guys.

And with awesome classics like this clean C10 mixing red carpet looks with everyday drivability, it's not hard to see why.

And if you're looking for a super cool cruiser that can be enjoyed for years to come, it's the classic of your dreams!", "BODYWORK/TRIM", "As far as styling goes, few vehicles have aged better than late '60s and early '70s Chevrolets. In fact, toeing the line between rock-solid and refined, the Action Line C/K is probably one of the most attractive trucks ever built. Making the best of that model's boxy proportions, this fleetside C10 seals slick, black paint under a glossy clearcoat shell. That sinister 2-stage highlights a laser-straight body, the result of a fresh restoration that wrapped in the Spring of 2015. That clean body's top-notch metalwork is, from the outside of its panels, completely undetectable. And best of all, those panels remain just as GM designed them, with nothing frenched, filled or altered in any major way.", "However, there are some cool details that really make this build pop. The reboot began with a black-trimmed grille, which hangs a vivid bowtie and bright halogen headlights above a mirrored bumper and factory parking lamps. Behind that grille, a domed hood leads the eye to fresh glass that's centered between a factory antenna, polished wipers and a small cargo light. At the sides of that glass, the truck's monochromatic, wet-look profile has been shaved of everything but traditional door handles, a simple fuel filler and 1-piece marker lamps. And at the back of that profile, a smoothed tailgate hides a clean Oak bed between trim-free tail lights and a second mirrored bumper.", "ENGINE", "Gaze in to the truck's body-matched engine bay and you'll find 427 cubic inches of Chevrolet big block! At the top of that storied mill, a Quick Fuel Technology 4-barrel mixes wind supplied by a polished and decaled air filter with fuel that's piped through stainless fluid lines and a mechanical pump. That air/fuel mixture floods a polished Edelbrock intake on the way to iron Chevrolet heads, which hang polished valve covers between a polished breather and Hooker Competition headers. At the back of those heads, an aftermarket HEI distributor sequences spark through loomed Moroso Wire Technologies plug wires. Opposite that distributor, a combination of billet and steel pulleys spin a rebuilt alternator, requisite power steering and a modern AC compressor. In front of those pulleys, a fresh aluminum radiator circulates coolant around a stylized support and shrouded pulley fan. And details like a Lokar throttle linkage, a CPP master cylinder and factory-spec Harrison AC components frame the Chevy Orange engine in a sea of pleasing and functional ancillaries.", "DRIVETRAIN/SUSPENSION", "With that kind of power on tap, it should come as no surprise that the bottom of this C10 features a host of noteworthy upgrades. Everything starts with a sturdy, factory chassis that was thoroughly powder-coated during the truck's frame-off restoration. Behind the sweet engine, a proven 700R4 4-speed engages a stout, 12-bolt rear end. That fully sorted drivetrain rides on a lowered, factory-spec suspension. Stops are provided by red, power-assisted calipers, which squeeze drilled and slotted rotors at all four corners. Modern power steering provides good feel and great performance. Spent gases float from the aforementioned headers to Mandrel-bent pipes and polished Magnaflow mufflers. Power meets the pavement through Billet Specialties Bonneville Gs, which spin a quartet of 255/55R18 Nitto NT420S. And everything, from this Chevy's stainless fluid lines to its urethane chassis bushings, is fresh, expertly finished and ready for action.", "INTERIOR", "In the '70s, trucks were all about comfort and utility \u2013 not DVDs, wireless and navigation systems. That's why it's so refreshing to hop in the cab of this purposeful but nicely appointed half-ton. The star of the show is a houndstooth bench that definitely ups the style quotient. Below that seat, stain-free carpet is stretched tight between fresh sound deadening and stainless-trimmed foot pedals. Above that carpet, petite door panels found chrome door handles behind chrome window cranks. Above those panels, a stainless-trimmed headliner leads a manually operated courtesy lamp. Steering is channeled through a familiar Chevy rally wheel, which spins around a tilting column. And at the front of the cockpit, a stylish dash hangs factory telemetry beside factory air conditioning and a direct-fit stereo.", "OUR SALE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION", "A few build photos", "If you're looking for a unique classic that mixes a great restoration with unmatched style and instant fun, this Chevy deserves your full attention. It's spectacular from every angle. It plays to a level of nostalgia that everyone can appreciate. And, whether you're setting up at a show or just spending Saturday afternoon on the town, it's guaranteed to be the center of attention!"], "Exterior:": "Black", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "359"}},
