The big news would be in 67 though with the addition of the Coronet RT. This 67 is a great example of what the RT package gave you. Under the hood is a period correct 375 horse fire breathing big block also known as the 440 Magnum. This impressive engine has been brought back to its original bone stock form and is just as impressive today as it was in 67. The original manifolds only make it that much more authentic. Mated up to the best transmission to ever come from MOPAR the 727 is still a sought after piece today. The gold exterior shows nicely with all the correct RT badging there is no way it could be mistaken for anything else. Inside the black interior like the exterior is period correct and shows nicely. The middle console spits between the bucket seats and house the automatic transmission shifter. With these MOPARs only going up in value this Coronet would make a great investment that you can actually enjoy.
