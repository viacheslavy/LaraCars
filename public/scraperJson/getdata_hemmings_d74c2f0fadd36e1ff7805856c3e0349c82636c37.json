This particular car spent the majority of its life in Florida as a toy for a retired gentleman to drive. He passed away a few years ago and had willed it to a friend of his here in Minnesota. The owner decided it was time for somebody else to start enjoy since he didn't drive it as much as he would like. It has had one prior repaint and is still in its original color of Roxena Red which looks great on this car. If you take a look at the pictures you'll see the ''bumper fillers'' are in great shape, not faded, cracked, or missing like so many that you see advertised. The odometer reads 46897 and is believed to be original miles according to the gentleman that owned the car while it was in Florida. You can check out the still pictures of the underside and see that the floor and frame are all in good shape. This car goes down the road nice and smooth like you would expect from a 1975 Eldorado. You can watch and listen to the video provided and you'll hear how nice and smooth the engine runs. Watch the whole video and you'll be able to see the interior is original and what you would expect of a car in this condition.

There was an all-new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. Stretched body and trim; Fleetwood emblems and embellishments; doors cut into a formal, high-headroom roof, and generally higher appointment and trim levels continued to mark Cadillac's most luxurious line.
