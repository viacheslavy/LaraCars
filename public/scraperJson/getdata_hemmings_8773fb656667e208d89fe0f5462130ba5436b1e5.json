You can see that the Torino represents an obvious blending of muscle car sensibilities into a more sizable form - a sort of supersized muscle car.  Besides some of the more directly muscle car inspired styling cues, like the low profile hood scoop, it has a more flowing shape than most of the cars of its time. The front windshield has a pronounced angle to it, and the rear roofline gradually descends from rear windshield to deck lid. Its light ivy yellow paint replaces the lime color it began with. It's a more subtle shade than the original and, as it's very close to the meadowlark yellow color offered when this Torino was new, looks very era-appropriate. This remains a well-put together car - its doors and hood open and shut smoothly, its front and rear bumpers sit nice and level and its exterior badging is intact and well-secured.", "The black vinyl interior is both well-preserved and a great example of late '60s automotive styling. The wide-backed bucket seats that sit in place of the more common bench seat of the time are really comfortable, as is the bench seat in back, and both are in good shape, with no threadbare areas or tears. This is certainly a vintage classic ride that thoroughly lends itself to group outings, as there's all kinds of room in back for your rear seat passengers. Just beyond the original steering wheel sits a dash area with a great, singular look. No fewer than four individual pods make up the instrument cluster, whose factory-issued gauges remain easily readable, and an AM radio sits surrounded by a wood grain panel for just the right nostalgic vibe. The unusually spacious trunk area is in good order - its floor is lined with Ford plaid fabric and its trunk walls and wheel wells show no obvious dings. Even with a full-size spare residing on the trunk floor, there's still plenty of room for luggage.", "OK, the real reason this Torino GT is special can be found under the hood: a 351 cubic inch V8. It's been augmented by a Weiand intake manifold, Holley 4-barrel carburetor, and an aluminum radiator, but the rest appears to be pretty original. The stock look is augmented by a set of chrome valve covers and air cleaner lid, which also wears a reproduction decal. It's pretty tidy under the hood with easy service access, even with those long-tube headers. The 3-speed FMX transmission has been rebuilt and the beefy 9-inch rear just shrugs it off when you hammer the throttle. New components include a new timing chain and cover, water pump, shocks, and aluminum radiator. A Flowmaster dual exhaust system gives it an awesome Ford small block sound and you'll be impressed by how tidy it looks underneath for a mostly original car. Classic styled steel wheels offer a more sporting look than plain old steelies and it wears 215/60/14 BFGoodrich T/A radials all around.", "This is a fun, affordable Ford that delivers in all the ways that matter.

This SportsRoof 302 Torino has a 3-speed automatic transmission and an original feel.  In 1968 Ford Motor Company introduced its intermediate line with a new body and new styling. Along with the new body and styling came a new subseries in the Fairlane line the Torino.  Styling was all new for the 1968 Fairlane/Torino and it was drastically changed from the 1967 models. The new intermediate had grown in size and weight and a new fastback model was added. The front fascia featured a full width recessed grille with horizontal quad headlights placed at the outer edges. Horizontal dividing bars were featured in the grille depending on the model. Parking lights were placed at the outer edge of the front fenders and wrapped around the corner to also act as side marker lights (a new requirement in 1968). The body sides were smooth with one horizontal body crease running just below the beltline from front to back. The taillights were rectangular in shape and vertically situated in the rear panel above rear bumper. Reverse lights were located in the middle of the taillights and small side marker lights were located on the rear edge of the quarter panel. Fastback models which Ford called SportsRoof featured a slightly concaved rear taillight panel unique to that body style. The new SportsRoof body style featured a gently sloped long roof line that extended to the edge of the trunk lid. This new fastback body style gave the Fairlane and the Torino excellent aerodynamics that would later prove to be advantageous on the race track. Options include: AC Hub caps radial tires seat belts and vinyl interior.  This To view the car in greater detail including 100+ HD photos and HD video please visit www.gatewayclassiccars.com.

We are always searching the country for very clean and very original; unmolested, classic automobiles. We spend many hours every week, trying to find the one that has been sitting in a storage facility or barn for many years.", "Well, I am very happy to say that this time we have found exactly that. What we have here is a 1973 Ford Gran Torino Sport Fastback, with a factory, untouched, and original Q code 390 Cobra Jet V8, with original build sheet. These are very rare cars. We know, because we buy and sell more of them than just about anybody, and the q code Cobra Jet fastback, is a very rare find. Now let's talk about this beautiful original one family car. This amazing muscle car was purchased new in 1973; in 1975 it was sold to the brother of the original owner. This amazing car was then driven by that young man until 1984, at which time it was put in dry storage, and did not move until we purchased it in the winter of 2017. This amazing time capsule, was sitting untouched for 33 years. When we bought it, it was in its original paint, with original interior and original engine. This 73 Torino Sport was as straight as could be, and very nice. We had this muscle car, repainted back to original color, had new front seat upholstery done ( back seat has never been sat on ) new headliner, new carpet, had a new vinyl top put on ( very rare original blue color code) added new laser stripe( also factory correct) new gas tank, rebuilt carb, and new wheels and tires.  As allot of you know, this is my very favorite body style of any car ever built. I think the 1972- 1973 Gran Torino Sport Fastback is as tough and as pure muscle as any car ever was. These cars are getting very rare, and very hard to find. Add to that fact, the Q code Cobra Jet V8, is a one owner car. This is an amazing find, for any collector, or true car enthusiast. This is my favorite color combination of any Torino we have owned. She runs and drives great, with only 67,000 original miles, this is one amazing Torino. We have a full Marti report on this great machine, showing only 900 ever built in this color combination.  If you are looking for a car that will make you and anybody in it look and feel cool, I'm telling you this is it. These are just plain, BAD ASS cars, and this one tops the charts. This body style has \u201ca don't mess with me attitude\u201d that plain screams tough.  If you are in the market for a very rare, tough car, that not everybody owns, this might be just the ticket. These fastback Torino's are going up in value every day. We have priced this beautiful car at $22,500.00 I don't believe this car, in this condition, with these original miles can be bought anywhere for that price, and if you find one buy it. They are going fast. At Cool Classic Rides, we sell nice daily drivers, that you can take out on any back road or forgotten by way. We don't sell TV trailer queens, or cut up miss fits. We sell Fun. Feel free to call us with any questions, we love to talk cars. We can also assist with your classic car finance options, and transport needs. Remember we love trades also. We love our business, and we love selling cars. You can see this and our entire inventory on our YOUTUBECHANNEL   COOL CLASSIC RIDES."], "Exterior:": "Blue", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "67415"}},
