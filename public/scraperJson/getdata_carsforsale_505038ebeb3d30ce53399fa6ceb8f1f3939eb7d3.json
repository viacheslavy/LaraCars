era quite like this 1971 Pontiac GTO.  After all, the big V8 hiding under that angular sheetmetal shows that you can easily mix fast with class.  ", "  The first impression is equal parts aggression and elegance.  The new front end for '71 gave each of the quad headlights an individual style, and the front grille was far more pronounced.  It was the perfect mixtures of European and American styles, almost like if a Z/28 Camaro mated with a Jaguar XJ6.  Plus, the black vinyl roof and well integrated rear bumper are timeless symbols of premium design.  But this coupe is far from just a luxury machine.  The factory-correct Cardinal Red has a bold presence that gets your heart pumping.  Plus, this has all the right aggression with the correct GTO badging, creased fenders, and large hood scoops that could inhale anything that gets in their way.  And no great Pontiac is complete without out the Rally II wheels with PMD center caps.  ", "  You paid a bit more to upgrade to a Pontiac back in the day, and you can instantly tell why when you open the door.  The design of the black bucket seats with comfort weave insert offer equal parts style and coziness.  The dark vinyl matches the door panels, carpets, and center armrest, but the interior is not a monochromatic experience.  There is wood appliqu\u00c3\u00a9' on the center console, three-spoke steering wheel, and surrounding the gauge cluster.  Plus, Pontiac's performance cars feature a section of billet aluminum trim for some nice standout aggression within this luxury.  And while this looks like a pristine factory package, keen eyes will spot some upgrades like an AM/FM/cassette stereo with digital tuner, and provisions for air conditioning.  ", "  These GTOs came with the big 400 cubic-inch V8, and the block even decodes period correct.  That's why this one wears the correct Pontiac Turquoise paint with pride, and even has a period-correct four-barrel carburetor.  1971 was still in the prime of the muscle car era, so Pontiac rated this big V8 at as much as 350 hp right out of the box.  That's why the motor fires up with an angry growl out of the quad pipe dual exhaust.  While the TH400 three-speed transmission and 12-bolt rear end is part of a stout factory package, there's much more to this coupe.  After all, the automatic gearbox, power steering, and front disc brakes also make this an easy any time cruiser.  ", "  Both sophisticated and sinister, this GTO has some serious attitude.  That's why it's been your dream car... but you're not the only one, so hurry if you want this to be yours.

HISTORY  Changes for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most obvious from the outside.[14] Beginning in 1978, the Pontiac group introduced a new special edition vehicle. The Firebird Formula LT Sport Edition which featured a revised 10% raised compression Chevy 305 V8 powertrain producing 155 hp (same as 1977 Chevy Monza Mirage) combined with a floor center console four-speed manual T-10 BW transmission coupled to a limited-slip differential final drive. The limited touring package (LT) also included a cabin roof, door, fender and hood graphics scheme, the Trans-Am sports handling package with HD gas shocks, modular alloy wheels and the SE Trans-Am rear deck spoiler with \"Formula\" word graphic detail. T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid year.

During the 1970's high fuel costs and higher insurance rates conspired to end the 'First Golden Age' of muscle cars. Pontiac's Firebird Trans Am refused to go quietly, bolstered by increasing sales and the numerous performance packages offered throughout the decade. By 1975 the largest engine available in a Corvette was 350 cubic inches, while the Trans Am could be equipped with a 455 through 1976 or a 400 (6.6L) untill 1979. Our Heritage Brown (69) 1979 Trans Am is a nice (numbers matching) example of the last of the 6.6L cars. Originally delivered to Stowasser Pontiac-Cadillac in Santa Maria, California, the car runs and drives very well and appears to be in mostly original condition. The long list of standard and optional features includes the L80 6.6L V8, automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, power windows, air conditioning, limited slip differential, tilt steering column, additional acoustical insulation, Lamp Group, and the Custom Trim Group. A set of new B.F. Goodrich Radial T/A's wrapped around classic Pontiac 'Snowflake' aluminum wheels provide the correct stance. The dealer copy of the original window sticker is included. Bell bottom blue jeans are not!

Mechanically the engine runs very well and the transmission shifts smoothly.  The work that's already been done includes, new exhaust from front to rear, battery, new interior, recent convertible top, new boot and the tires have hardly any miles on them.  Work needed includes a fair amount of lower body panel corrosion and a portion of the trunk floor has been replaced but needs to be welded in.  The top electronically and mechanically is in perfect working order.  The windshield does have a couple of repairable rock chips.  A new finish on this car will make it a show winner.  The brakes have been redone as well as some of the brake lines, there is actually more brake power than necessary and they could be backed off a little.  There is very little if anything missing other than a couple of emblems and most of the chrome will polish up.  The previous owner had the vehicle in inside storage and it comes with a fabric car cover.   According to the NADA Classic Car Pricing Guide, full bore on this car in perfect condition is $39,795.00 and average value is $22,365.00.  For a quick sale on this vehicle, I'm wanting to put it out below Low Retail just to get my money turned and get a potentially very nice car out of my inventory as quickly as possible.  This is one you can turn some real money on in a fairly short time and I would do it myself but there's no room in the restoration shop at this time so take advantage, be the first to call !!!!  This is the Pontiac everybody knows and wants and it's at an affordable price, this is the one! Don't wait I'm going to move this one out of inventory quickly.   Mileage stated in listing is the odometer reading only not to be interpreted as certified miles.

HISTORY  The 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model. The Super Duty engine, Muncie 4-speed, and TurboHydramatic 400 automatic were no longer available in 1975. Due to the use of catalytic converters starting in 1975, the THM 400 would not fit alongside the catalytic converter underneath the vehicle. The smaller TurboHydramatic 350 automatic was deemed enough. The 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models.
