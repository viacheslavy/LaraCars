He was LAPD, and it hadbeen stolen off a used dealer's lot in Los Angeles, and he bought it as aninsurance recovery, when they found it without the engine. He bought a usedengine and transmission and had it installed. The parties that had stolen it,removed the exterior badges, removed all VINs, except for the stamp in the metalof the front trunk(pic 2) and painted over the original green, to a dark blue.This must have been a bad problem, because I even have a police trainingbulletin (pic 3, blue bulletin with VW outline) which the San Fran police deptput out to help ID VINs of stolen porsches and vw's. He liked the darkblue, so when the paint peeled in later years, he painted it over it again withthe same dark blue. The car lived in a garage in Burbank most of it's earlylife. But then when they moved to Palm Springs, it sat under a tree for a littlewhile. I heard about the car's new resting place, and talked him intoletting it come to me in 2004. He told me the engine had a bad \"knocking\", andthat it would need to be fixed.I received the car in 2004, 2 days before mytwins were born. The car got pushed into my garage, and I thought I would domore work on it. I removed the engine and started the tear down, When idiscovered it was beyond my abilities, I took it to a mechanic who told me theengine would cost an extraordinary amount to repair, more than I could afford soI again mothballed the project.In 2012 I trailored the car to a mechanic whoreplaced the front pan and did work on the front suspension, as this seems to bea bad area of rust for these cars.Then in 2013 I trailored it to Ralph'sAuto in Baltimore, where I traded my old engine for a 1968 engine.
