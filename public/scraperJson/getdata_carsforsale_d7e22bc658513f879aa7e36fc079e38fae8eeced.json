The body is highlighted by fine tan pinstriping. The Tan convertible top and Tan boot are as-new.The Bentley Continental Convertible is very rare compared to the corresponding Rolls Corniche Convertible, and it is considered more desirable because of its understated front end styling and Bentleys sporting heritage. Between 1985 and 1989 a total of only 195 Continental Convertibles were sold worldwide, of which a small percentage came to the United States. Historic data and value guides show that the Continental brings a substantial premium over its Rolls Corniche cousin.Our car has been cherished and dealer-maintained since new, and has covered only 9787 miles. Our car also has the desirable Cocktail Set option built into both front doors, and all the pieces of the set are still present. For 1986 the Bentley Continental received the same upgrades that led Rolls-Royce to change the designation of their car to Corniche II. Upgrades include rack and pinion steering, alloy wheels, and bi-level air-conditioning. The car is powered by Rolls renowned 6.75 Liter V-8 with Bosch fuel injection and features a four speed automatic transmission.With their Mulliner Park Ward coachwork, and bespoke quality, the best examples of these fine convertibles will be treasured by collectors for decades to come.
