In 1964, Ford presented the Playboy Playmate of the Year with a convertible Mustang with a color code WT9301 or Playmate Pink. In 1965, this color was a special order option that was produced in Ford's San Jose, California assembly plant. On a true Playmate Pink Mustang, the door VIN plate will be missing a paint code and instead there will be a DSO (District Sales Office) number which indicates the car was special-ordered by the dealer.  This Mustang fits that criteria.  There is no official data on the number produced, but according to our limited research, we believe there was less than 100 vehicles with this color. Although this vehicle did get repainted over 10 years ago, they did an excellent job on the body that is in excellent condition.  Other than the very rare color, this vehicle has the original 289 V8 with a 2-barrel carburetor and the original C4 three speed automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes and original AM radio. The interior is restored to original white with black trim and looks fantastic. We can arrange shipping to your location. If you have any questions, please contact Savannah Classic Cars 912-235-2347 (no texts)."], "Exterior:": "Playmate Pink", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "31127"}},

The engine is mated to the C4 Automatic Trans and the 8'' Rear End.  This Mustang does have Power Brakes with Disc on the front and drums on the rear.

The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter. Introduced early on April 17, 1964 (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), and thus dubbed as a \"1964\u00bd\" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A. The Mustang has undergone several transformations to its current sixth generation.

This is easily one of the most iconic body styles Ford ever built and the one we have for you has a killer look.  It was an original California car that has been restored back to the factory color combo.  In the paragraphs to follow we will give a brief description of the exterior, interior, and driveline of the Ford, but first we would like to tell you a little about us.", "Smoky Mountain Traders is a classic car dealer in east Tennessee. We are family owned, operated, and own our entire inventory, no consignments, and only deal in muscle cars and vintage auto. You can count on us to have 70 to 80 cars at all times. We don't have a big show room that our customers would otherwise pay for. So, that's how we can sell for less than other dealers. To contact us for more information, pictures, or any questions call our office at (865)988-8088 or visit our SmokyMountainTraders website.", "We will start off with exterior of the Mustang.  The body is straight down the sides and all the door, hood, and trunk gaps are great.  Also, the fit of the all the panels to the door and hood are excellent.  Everything is covered in the Nightmist Blue paint that is the factory color and it has been buffed and polished to a mirror finish that's slick as a ribbon.  As you look over the chrome you will notice the bumpers were replaced, and that the taillights, vent windows, and emblems are like new.  All the stainless is in great condition from the window trim to the rocker trim.  You'll notice the front windshield appears replaced with a new seal installed.  The rest of the glass is in great condition and new door weather-stripping has been installed.  To finish off the look it's sitting on a set of Magnum wheels with new Red Line Tires.", "Next, we will look at the interior of the Fastback.  On the inside, it's also done in the factory combination of Black with Bucket seats.  As you open the door you'll see the door panels have been replaced and are in like new condition.  Also, the seat covers are new and all the padding is great.  The carpet is done in black and has been replaced along with the seal plates.  Looking at the headliner it's also been replaced and it has a great fit.  All the interior lights are working along with the emergency brake and horn.  As you look at the dash you'll see it has the 140 Speedo that's working.  Also, all the other gauges are working along with the signals and lights.  This being a 2+2 it has the fold down rear seat, and it also has seat belts front and back.  Inside the trunk you'll see new weather stripping and it has a trunk mat, floors mats, and a spare.", "Finally, we will get to the driveline of this Ford.  Under the hood it's powered by what we believe is the original 289 V8.  This car was born on June 17 1966 and the engine casting date has it built at the end of May and the Engine tag has it as June Engine.  This is a C code car so it's setup with the Ford Intake and the Two Barrel Carb.  Also, you'll see it has the smog pump as it was an original California car.  The 289 is mated to the Top Loader Four Speed and 8'' Rear end with a 2.80 Gear.   This Mustang has Power Steering with Disc Brakes on the Front.  For exhaust it has Manifolds with dual pipes and Xlerator Mufflers.

Their prized project combined the sensibilities of a sports car with the convenience of seating for four, and the result was such a success that the Mustang carved out an entirely new niche on the automotive landscape - the Pony Car. This 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang convertible was there from the beginning of all that euphoria and now, more than a half century later, it's ready to provide plenty of enjoyment on the road to go along with its direct link to that pivotal time.", "Clad in its original shade of Pagoda green that sits underneath a very solid clearcoat, this Mustang provides visual evidence as to why Ford scored such a decided victory. It's compact, yet not cramped ... sporty, yet not at all ostentatious. Its long hood and short deck lid became a hallmark of the classic muscle cars that would follow, but at the time of its release, it was a design that boldly defied the norm. The finishing touches on this Pony have all been carefully looked after, so you'll find its bumpers both fore and aft sitting appropriately level and sporting clean chrome, its body alignment impressively tight and even, and its trim - from headlight to taillight casings - all representing well. Should you find yourself out on the road enjoying an open-air motoring session and the skies above you turn dark, there's no need to worry - the power black convertible top is in fine condition and raises easily into place to protect you from inclement weather.", "There's a very clean black vinyl interior sitting inside the doors and, from the looks of things, it's been well sheltered to keep it out of reach of the sun's harmful influence, so its upgraded Pony furnishings all look great. The low-backed bucket seats up front don't appear to have seen much use, and an expanse of clean black carpeting, punctuated by Pony floor mats up front, sits just underneath. Despite the Mustang's modest size, you'll find an unexpected amount of legroom in back. The dash area looks great, even for a restored classic. The instrument cluster is occupied by a crystal-clear speedometer and a pair of gauges to each side that sport very fresh looking silver frames, joined by a pair of aftermarket oil and water temperature gauges just below. An underdash air conditioning system has been added with an upgraded compressor running on R134a. And in back, the trunk area looks straight and the signature Ford plaid lining leaves enough exposed steel to see that the trunk floors and inner wheelhouses are well aligned and solid.", "You'll find a very clean engine compartment underneath the hood, with a smooth-running 260-cubic inch V8 sitting front and center with a chrome air cleaner on top, surrounded by fresh-looking hoses, belts and clean components. You can read every word on the oil filter sitting below - a strong indication that the gaskets just above are fresh and doing their job. The engine pairs with a 3-speed automatic C4 renowned for its durability to make for a low-effort and dependable drive train. When this Mustang debuted, front disc brakes weren't a given, but they're on board here to provide fade-resistant braking. A look underneath will reveal a reassuringly sturdy undercarriage with new-looking floor pans, suspension components and dual exhaust system. This Ford classic sits on a set of 15'' stock Mustang rims outfitted with Arizonian Silver Edition III tires.", "It's the car that started an automotive movement, and you don't often find examples as clean as this 1965 Ford Mustang convertible.

When you walk around it the body panels appear to be factory with all the gaps being symmetrical, and the fit of the doors, hood, and trunk are great.  It's covered in the Arcadian Blue Paint that looks to be mostly original.  All the glass looks to be factory along with the window trim.  All the chrome is still very nice, but is showing some age.  To finish off the look it's sitting on a set of 14'' Styled Steel Wheels with Hankook Tires.", "Next, we will look at the interior of the Coupe.  On the inside, it's also done in what appears to be the factory interior.  It has the blue crinkle vinyl with a front bench seat.  The seat covers are older and there's a small tear on the driver side.  Both door panels appear original and are in very good condition.  The headliner is done in the light blue and is also very nice for its age.  Looking at the dash it all appears stock, and the dash lights are working.  The AC is mounted under the dash and is also working.", "Finally, we will look at the driveline of the Ford.  Under the hood it's been upgraded to a 302 Engine that's set up with a Ford Intake and AutoLite Carb.  It's dressed in stock style valve covers and breather.  The engine is mated to a C4 Trans and 8'' Rear End with a 2.80 Gear.  This Mustang has Power Brakes, Power Steering, and Air Condition.  The exhaust flow thru stock manifolds with the stock style exhaust.  When you look under this '65 it appears to be all original floors and frame, there's even still some factory over spray on the floors.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.

This 1969 Ford Mustang Mach I is a true late '60s muscle car classic featuring maximum visual impact that's been skillfully applied. It also carries an impressive array of fresh parts from front to back and will pull into its next owner's garage with a Marti report in tow to prove its genuine Mach I identity.", "This Mach I's aggressive look will stand out in any crowd of classic cars and if you take a look up close, you'll appreciate the craftsmanship that's gone into its build. Set against the backdrop of deep yellow paint are some great visual features, including factory applied blackout hood treatment that surrounds a fully-functional scoop, as well as blackout headlight buckets, side mirrors and taillight panel that add to its custom appearance. Flame graphics rise up from the front and extend backward over the fenders as if blown by the force of this muscle car's rapid acceleration, and they're no mere decals - they're skillfully painted on, outlined with sharp green pinstripes that contain very sharp coloring inside.  It's top quality work, for sure, and a good buff and wax session will have it looking its best in short order. The look from the front is killer, as well - the combination of the black grille, black headlight buckets and the black air dam sitting below was well-thought out and equally well-executed, and you'll find that same attention to detail shown on all sides of this classic in the form of its very clean lines and well-fitted body panels.", "The black vinyl interior has been refurbished while retaining its original configuration, and it looks great. Ford shifted to higher-backed front buckets to provide better support the year this Mach I debuted and the ones inside are well-positioned for many more miles of driving comfort, as is the bench seat in back. It's a great looking driving environment and the woodgrain steering wheel beckons you to grab ahold and get out on the road, and the dash area in front of it features fresh-looking woodgrain inserts and is crowned by a straight dash pad showing no ill effects of exposure to the sun. A new Pioneer AM/FM/CD player sits front and center, with an auxiliary port to expand its audio options and an array of speakers under its control that includes a 10'' subwoofer flanked by a pair of tweeters mounted on the rear deck lid to fill the interior with sound. The air conditioning blows cold and strong out of the in-dash vents to keep everyone nice and comfortable, and the trunk area in back is neat and tidy, with a full-size spare sitting inside that's wrapped in signature Ford plaid.", "Raise the blackened hood and you'll see a very clean engine compartment that's harboring a great collection of fresh components. The 351 cubic inch V8 whose Edelbrock intake and 4-barrel carb have only logged about 110 miles since being added is pulling very strong and sounding great. It's paired with a 3-speed automatic transmission that's just off of its rebuild.  Featuring recently replaced power brakes - with discs up front - and smooth power steering, this classic navigates with ease and stops with fade-resistant dependability. A number of other essential parts have also been replaced, including the electronic ignition, shocks, ball joints and tie rods, and a new 4-core aluminum radiator sits in place of the original to keep temperatures in check. This high impact Mustang rides on a set of 14'' American Racing wheels that carry BF Goodrich T/A radials.", "This 1969 Ford Mustang Mach I features outstanding curb appeal that's well complemented by its strong running condition.

Complete1970 saw the previous 351W (Windsor) V8 engine options replaced with a new 351C (5.8L) Cleveland V8 in either 2V (2-venturi carburetor) or 4V (4-venturi carburetor) versions. The\u00a0 351C (4V) M Code engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300 bhp at 5400 rpm. This new performance engine incorporated elements learned from the Ford 385 series engine and the Boss 302, particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves and the thin-wall casting technology. The standard 351 Windsor engine was really a slightly enlarged 289/302 and as its name implies came from Ford's Windsor engine family. The thin wall cast small block with 5 bolt straight valve covers accepted regular spark plugs and used a timing chain in the block. The 351 Cleveland, on the other hand, belonged to Ford's 355 engine family and was a big small block with 8 bolt 2 plane valve covers, used the smaller 14mm spark plugs and had a separate front cover bolted to the block housing the timing chain and routing water but most importantly it sported different and larger heads and a unique intake manifold which makes these fire breathers the legends that they are with lots of horsepower and as they were only manufactured for five years consequently they are not only very expensive to buy but also hard to find. The Boss 351 Mustang was a Cleveland and one of the fastest production cars ever made for the street right from the factory.This particular example is a seriously striking example which turns heads wherever she goes! It features a no expense custom build over several years on an original southern California car (with it's original California Blue License Plates to be sold with the car) by it's enthusiast owner and the rebuilt upgraded engine is extremely strong and responsive and which sounds absolutely magnificent, the 4 speed manual transmission shifts smoothly through the gears and the engine temperature always remains cool. It boasts a thick file of receipts documenting the build!\u00a0The 'Black' paint and matching interior is extraordinarily striking and a real head turner. This must be one of the finest and most tastefully customized example's of a 1970 Ford Mustang Fastback with an extremely desirable and powerful 351 Cleveland bored and rebuilt V8 engine in rare turn-key and daily head-turning condition of an all time classic American muscle car icon! Perfect car for any Mustang enthusiast or simply any classic American muscle car collector!"]}},
