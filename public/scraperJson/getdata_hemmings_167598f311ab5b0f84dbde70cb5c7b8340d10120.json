The 55 3100 has been an iconic staple of the classic car market place for the past couple decades and for good reason. There timeless design paired with the unlimited resources in the aftermarket gives people the opportunity to restore them back to normal or build a full custom. This 55 has had an absolute ton of work to bring it to what you see today. The all steel body has no signs of any bondo repair and appears to be free of any rust. The red paint is slick and gives the car a true hotrod feels with the scallops only putting an exclamation point on it. The bed has been done in a dark cherry stain and accented by the yellow bolts carrying the theme throughout the build. The drivetrain has been updated to a much more modern driveline. The engine is a full roller 305 that gives ample power up top and a tremendous amount of torque down low. Switched over from fuel injection to carburetion it is a much easier motor to work on. Matched up with a 4-speed manual transmission this old truck is an absolute blast to say the very least. The front end was donated by a late 70\"??s Camaro and gives the car a much better feel for the road while giving it a much more aggressive stance. The interior has been tastefully with a set of bucket seats that are extremely comfortable. The shifter is in the perfect position to be slamming gears or casually shifting when taking those back road cruises. All in all this 55 is a nicely built ultra-fun truck to drive or show if that\"??s your thing. Options on this 1955 Chevrolet 3100 include; AM/FM/CD Power Steering Power Brakes Cloth Interior and Alloy Wheels with Radial Tires.

THe door handles have been shaved and has a frenched in power radio antenna on the passenger cab.  The interior is done with cloth bucket seats and console from a 90's silverado with gray carpet.  The gauges are newer aftermarket and the odometer shows approx 2500 miles.  I would assume that is how many miles are on the rebuild.  The truck does have a few chips that have been touched up from enjoying the truck running down the road, mainly on the running boards and top of box.

This 1955 Chevrolet takes the classic 3100 body and mounts it on a more modern 4x4 frame, and it even has great upgrades like V8 power and an A/C interior.", "This truck knows how to instantly announce it's something different.  The modern application of a blue-green paint has a eye-catching level of gloss.  In fact, the only thing to outshine it are all the brightwork pieces you expect from a first-year Task Force truck.  This includes the chrome bumpers, wide grille, headlight surrounds, and side mirrors.  But while this kind of presentation can be found on street-eating custom Chevy trucks, this one stands above those... literally.  It's tough 4x4 prowess is gives it the kind of lifted stance that not many people see on these classics.  But more than just look ready to get down to business, this custom truck is also properly equipped.  That's why you have nice side steps to easily get into the cab.  Plus, there's a trailer hitch so you can be the coolest pickup to arrive with everything from a boat to a camper.", "Inside, you can see the new and vintage worlds blending seamlessly.  The vinyl on the bench seat nicely coordinates with the exterior color.  Plus, it has been customized with a Chevy bow tie embroidered in the center as well as comfortable cloth inserts for where you sit.  As you grab the newer Chevy steering wheel, it gives you a great view of classic 3100 elements that are still on display, like the gauges and dash panel.  But your real favorite feature is much more modern.  After all, we all love staying cool with R134a air conditioning.", "When you look under the hood, this really begins to reveal the true nature of this beast. The 350 cubic-inch V8 topped with a four-barrel carburetor is far more powerful than the stock 3100 motor.  And its fresh presentation lets you know it was cared for correctly.  That extra power from this V8 will be appreciated, because you can really use this truck for work and play.  This versatility starts with the chassis of a younger K-series 4x4. The four-wheel drive engages smoothly, and so you know this build was done right.  And since it comes from one of Chevy's longest production runs, the stout 4x4 components will always be easy to source. This more modern setup also means nice conveniences like power steering, a three-speed automatic transmission, BF Goodrich All-Terrain T/As, and front disc brakes.", "Rarely do you find a total package that's vintage, aggressive, and so capable.
