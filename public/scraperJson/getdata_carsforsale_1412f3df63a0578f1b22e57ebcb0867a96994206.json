The very nature of acquiring gains via equity is inherently risky depending on the factors and history affecting an asset. With that in mind, the idea is to find a classic which minimizes risk as much as possible. From an investment mindset, low risk is the major selling point of this 1 of 1 1964.5 Mustang. Never mind the fact that the car was assembled during the first hour of Mustang production. The fact that the car was 1 of 3 convertibles sent to Holman Moody for major modifications and subsequent pace car duty is beside the point. Just because the car was the only Ford Mustang to pace the 1964 Indianapolis 500 and, in the process, became the most modeled Ford in history doesn't mean all risk is moot. And, just because the car is a fanatically documented piece of automobilia that was driven by Ford Motor Company heir Benson Ford doesn't make it a risk-less investment. No, what matters most is that the combination of these monumental milestones provides potential buyers with one of the safest and most secure automotive assets on the planet. If you're shopping for a sure-fire winner, this, the most significant historic Mustang in the world, should be the FIRST classic you're willing to put money on!     The most significant historic Mustang in the world is a tall claim but, once you hear this convertible's incredible story, you'll whole-heartedly agree. In 1964, Lee Iacocca was preparing a massive marketing blitz for Ford's newly revealed pony car. Since the company's Falcon compact had already secured pace car duties for the 1964 Indy 500, Iacocca made his newest muse a last minute substitution. During the first hour of Mustang production, three convertibles were assembled with a combination of Falcon and 1963-coded Ford parts. And, as soon as those cars rolled off the Dearborn assembly line, they were shipped to legendary Charlotte tuner Holman Moody. In order to pace 'the great race' the cars needed to safely travel 140 miles per hour. So, the first thing Holman Moody did was, with Ford's blessing, replace the cars' stock 260 powerplants with detuned 289s that were being developed for the GT40 Le Mans racer. Next came a lowered and stiffened suspension. And finally, chrome marine handles were, along with custom flag stanchions, added for both form and function.     Unfortunately, Iacocca's grand but hasty plan encountered one major problem: Holman Moody only had time to complete two of the cars. When this Mustang and its counterpart were shipped to Indy, Mustang number three, being essentially a prototype, was scrapped. And when the two completed cars arrived at the brickyard, one immediately experienced mechanical failure. That meant the convertible you see here is the sole Mustang to, at the hands of Benson Ford, pace the 1964 Indianapolis 500. After a big day of speed and photo ops, the drop-top was unceremoniously returned to Ford. Ford, "], "title": "1964 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "23 .

The car is essentially rust free and has had a lot of metal work with several panels replaced.  We put new emblems and sill plates on the car and did some other finishing touches along with putting on brand new black wall tires all the way around on the original 14\u201d steel rims. The spare is included in the trunk.  It also has new carpet and has had late model front and rear Mustang seats inserted as well as the late model console for cruising comfort and convenience. The original front and rear seats go with the car and will need recovered and restored to be used.  The car runs and drives well and can be enjoyed as is, or it would make a great platform to take to the show car level with such a solid body and sub-frame.  The car doesn\u2019t really need anything and is ready to enjoy.  We continue to see a rising interest and demand for the early Mustang coupes and convertibles, and it makes them a great buy to get into the Muscle Car hobby.  The timeless styling of these early Mustang coupes and the first year of the legendary Pony Car makes this a car to remain on collectors\u2019 radars for decades to come.
