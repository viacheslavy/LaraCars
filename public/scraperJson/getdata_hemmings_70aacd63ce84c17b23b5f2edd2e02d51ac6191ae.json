While the paint does show well and shows little signs of age, with only very minor chipping (edges of the doors), the paint job was not done to a very high standard.  Paint has a nice shine to it, but the fact that the exhaust tips were sprayed over leaves us scratching our heads.  However, the good thing is that the car was originally gold over Camel Tan.  There is evidence under the hood of a previous paint job in red, but the gold that the car currently wears is the correct color.  Firebird hood decal is in great shape.  The body is in nice shape, with no dents or dings to note, other than a spot on the driver's side rear wheel well where the car appears to have been scuffed by what we assume to be a garage wall.  That spot was touched up, but it is still visible.  Chrome trim is very nice throughout.", "Interior:", "The interior is in nice shape.  The dash has no cracks in it, though it does show some age, and the seats are free of any tears, burst seams, or fading.  Steering wheel has a leather cover on it, and is fairly worn underneath.  There is a scratch on the center console.  Radio, fan, and headlights are not functioning.  Power windows, wipers, turn signals, and gauges are functional.  A/C has not been converted to R134a and is not functional.  Windshield is clear and crack free, with no wiper streak.  Side windows have some light scratches on them.", "Under the Hood / Underbody:", "The five-digit odometer reads 15,260, though largely irrelevant considering the fact that the engine is not the original unit.  The car was originally optioned with the 150hp W-code 301cid 4-BBL V8, but has since been swapped out for the more powerful (220hp, 320lbft) 6.6L 400cid 4-BBL Pontiac V8.  The underbody looks very nice, with no through rust of any sort.  Please take a good look through the photos, as the underbody is documented in detail.  Frame rails, rockers, and floors are all excellent.  The car will run nice and cool, but we would not consider this car a ready driver.  It will start just fine, but runs rough as it NEEDS A HEAD GASKET.  WE CAN DO THE SERVICE PRIOR TO SHIPPING, BUT PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS. Tires should be replaced before being driven at highway speeds, given that there is some dry rot on a couple of them, and a brake service should be performed, as the pedal is a bit mushy.  Automatic transmission feels good, the car shifts on time and without any bucking.", "Overall, this is a nice-looking Trans Am that would serve as an excellent starting point for a drive-and-tinker project.  While it could use some sorting, the car has a rock solid foundation and there is a lot to like about it.  Please feel free to reach out to Mike or Jake at 773-267-2684 or with any additional questions or requests."], "Exterior:": "Gold", "Condition:": "Good", "Transmission:": "Auto", "Mileage:": "115260"}},

It's the kind of blue that was often seen on some of the earlier models, and it really looks great on the final update to the second-generation body.  We love how the professional respray of the Atlantis Blue gives this T/A the feeling of a deep ocean whenever the sunlight hits it.  It really helps highlight the angular elements that came on these '79s like the pointed Endura front end, wide body kit, fender side ducts, and the full-length rear spoiler.  Plus, the Trans Am script in a brighter shade of blue almost gives this a two-tone effect.  And speaking of two-tone, the best and brightest blue element of this T/A is the iconic hood bird.", "For those who loved the exterior color, we've got even more blue for you inside.  Factory-correct and showing signs of being quite original, it's a true blue-on-blue coupe. And thanks to the T-tops you can easily share this full coordinating package with the world.  Looking at the condition of the vinyl bucket seats, door panels, dash, and center console, it's apparent that this has been a cherished T/A.  Full instrumentation was standard on Trans Ams, including the large tach and speedo.  The dials look great set in the iconic and aggressive machine-turned instrument panel. Ahead of that the driver gets the three-spoke sports steering wheel that should be quite familiar to Pontiac fans.  And while all this makes for a terrific sports car, there are also some very nice desirable comforts like power windows, and AM/FM/cassette stereo.", "The 403 cubic-inch, four-barrel V8 is the original numbers-matching powerplant.  It lives in an exceptionally tidy engine bay that has the blue block radiating from within the deep back components.  But what everyone will really take notice of is the ultra-cool shaker-style air topper (although this still correctly inhales through the front.)  The big torque of the big V8 moves the sporty coupe easily, but there's more to this car's story.  The Trans Ams were celebrated for being one of the best handing vehicles of their time. And that's not only the suspension, but also upgraded pieces like the four-wheel disc brakes and grippy radial tires on the iconic snowflake wheel.  Add in the three-speed automatic transmission and power steering, and this is a great all around classic cruiser.", "Great colors, great driving features, and the wind-in-your-hair T-top experience \u2013 this T/A is the total package.

But not everyone gets to find a 1979 Pontiac Trans Am that was born with this desirable color combo and is exceptionally well preserved today, right down to its original V8.", "This one nails the Bandit look in every way that matters. Better still, it's a factory black car, so there was no color change needed to make it look right. You can tell there was plenty of time and money invested in a professional respray so that the modern clearcoat helps it earn its Starlight Black name.  And of course, the gold detail package really makes this coupe standout.  Everything you want is in place, so the hood bird is so bold that it's to be feared, and all the lettering on every side is crisp and clear against the midnight paintjob.  And matching this gold accent package are the iconic snowflake 15-inch alloys.  So yes, all your favorite parts of this icon are already in place.", "''Black is beautiful,'' is the first thing Burt Reynolds said when he saw his Trans Am in the Bandit sequel, and this interior follows that line perfectly.  The high back vinyl bucket seats look factory fresh, and they provide the kind of all day comfort that would keep you happy bootlegging beer all across the South.  The carpets, door panels, center console, and every other key dark piece of this car have not lost its luster.  But this Trans Am doesn't just feel like midnight inside.  Just like the exterior trim, there are plenty of bright spots.  The driver gets to sit behind factory the sports steering wheel with a golden three-spoke design.  And beyond that is the machined aluminum dash that came on these upper class Trans Ams.  You'll notice this has all the right gauges, right down to the clock/tach combo.  There are plenty of comfortable features so you have power windows, power locks, and air conditioning.  Plus, we bet everyone will love it if you can find a Jerry Reed 8-track, because the original stereo is still cranking out the tunes.", "The 403 cubic-inch V8 is original to the car, and it has an authentic appearance right down to the factory shaker hood that sits on top of the four-barrel carburetor. The block is still covered in factory-correct Pontiac blue paint, and it looks like this powerplant has been treated to good regular maintenance. The Trans Am has a reputation for not only being quick, but also as one of the best all-around handling sports cars of its day. That's due to the right features like front disc brakes, as well as front & rear stabilizer bars.  Plus, this one has long-haul comfort, too, thanks to a three-speed automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, and modern Firestone Firehawk tires.", "This one has a feeling of total quality.  You see it in the detail like the weatherstripping, and feel it in the way this one drives with confidence.  That makes a car with great originality, proper maintenance, and an outstanding presentation.  Your total package T/A is waiting... but it won't linger for long.
