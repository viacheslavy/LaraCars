This sweet ride only has roughly 50k original miles on it! Between the deep yellow paint job and the tasteful exhaust note this car is definitely a very nice example of a late C3 Corvette.Under the hood of this beauty is the original 350 CID L48 engine. The powerplant of this car has been taken care of very well and pulls nicely. Providing spark to the engine are new A/C Delco plug wires. The front engine mounts were also replaced to help provide a firm feel of the drivetrain. Pleasing the ear are newly installed headers and side pipes. Sending the power to the rear axle is a four-speed manual transmission that shifts smoothly yet firmly through the gears to provide an engaged driving experience. When it comes time to light up the rear tires and let the bald eagles scream the driver will appreciate the limited slip differential. Moving outward the exterior of this retro sportscar is finished in a nice yellow paint that has excellent depth and shine. The paint overall is a very good driver quality and only has extremely minor imperfections. Supporting each corner of this sweet ride are polished rally wheels wrapped in BFG radial tires with plenty of tread life left of them. The side pipes not only provide an aggressive sound they also give the car an aggressive stance to match. Upon entering the cabin of this beast the driver will be greeted by a very sought-after option for C3 Vettes; a tilting steering wheel. This allows for drivers well into the 6 range to comfortably drive the car. Keeping the driver comfortable year-round is factory air that blows cold and of course heat. In the summer months the paint matched T-tops can be removed to allow plenty of sunshine and fresh air to enter the cabin. The seats are finished in black leather that is in good condition. The black carpet is also in good condition. If the driver ever tires of listening to the big V8 the AM/FM radio will provide an enjoyable audio experience. Overall this car is very nice and drives better than cars much newer. After driving this beauty one can surely tell that the car has been cared for and needs to go to a new owner that will keep it running for years to come.
