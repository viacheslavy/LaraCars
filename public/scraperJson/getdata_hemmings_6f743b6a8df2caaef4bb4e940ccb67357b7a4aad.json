The radio looks like a factory piece, but it's upgraded retrosound unit with a digital tuner and an aux input for the most modern music players.  The three-spoke steering wheel gives you that classic grippy feeling you expect from a Mustang, but beyond that, a crisp set of TPI gauges keep you better informed than the factory setup ever did.

The belts, wires, and hoses tell you this is a nicely maintained engine bay, and the sound of the dual exhaust reminds you why a V8 Mustang is always in demand.

But more than just a rare coupe that started a revolution, this one also has only averaged around 700 miles annually and it's believed to have its original F-code V8.  So read all the detail, but just know you're not the only enthusiast that's already excited.", "Ford had a huge hit on its hands with the first-generation Mustang.  It was an instant icon, and so when looking for the ultimate classic, you want the earliest example you can get that has both originality and rarity.  That's what makes this one so appealing.  Dynasty Green is a great way to represent the first run of the original pony car.  After all, this was a color that was phased out after '65.  And while many of these cars have traded it in for a more mainstream red or black, this one gets more distinctive every year that it retains its factory-correct hue.  You can tell this coupe has received the right care and investment over the years.  That's why the bumpers and taillight bezels keep it shining at their best.  Yes, the American Racing wheels are an upgrade in flair.  So while the original ones come with the sale, too, we think when you're the coupe that launched the pony car revolution you deserve to show off a little.", "Inside, the black vinyl is always a great interior to have, and this one shows high degrees of originality.  That means it's far from perfect, but it does certainly take a level care to still be this complete after over a half-century on this earth.  Bucket seats and a sporty three-spoke steering wheel are the great things that made you and the rest of American fall in love with the Mustang.  Even the AM radio is still cranking out tunes! But more than nostalgia, this one has some great features that collectors really look for.  For example, the center console is a great way to showcase a bright and premium interior.  And have you noticed that this 1964.5 even has the ultra-desirable Rally-Pac?", "When you open the hood, the bold blue valve covers and air topper grab your attention, but it's what's beneath them that's really special.  This is an F-code Mustang, which means it came from the factory with a 260 cubic-inch V8... and that's the block that's still under the hood today!  The 4/1/64 date coded block is believed to be original to the coupe, and original-style presentation certainly looks the part of correctness.  Once the 1964.5 production switched over to 1965, this option was gone.  So it's a cool piece of original history to have this still under the hood.  The same goes for the generator.  After all, it could easily be switched to an alternator, but it has been kept in this one all these years because Mustang people know to look for this special short-run component.  And with features like the power steering and the three-speed automatic transmission, you can comfortably drive this benchmark classic to all the shows you want.", "You're looking at an in-demand piece of automotive history.

Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project\"?supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months\"?while Iacocca himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. The T-5 prototype was a two-seat mid-mounted engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine. It was claimed that the decision to abandon the two-seat design was in part due to the increase in sales the Thunderbird had seen when enlarged from a two-seater to a 2+2 in 1958. Thus a four-seat car with full space for the front bucket seats as originally planned and a rear bench seat with significantly less space than was common at the time were standard. A Fastback 2+2 first manufactured on August 17 1964 enclosed the trunk space under a sweeping exterior line similar to the second series Corvette Sting Ray and European sports cars such as the Jaguar E-Type coupe.Favorable publicity articles appeared in 2600 newspapers the next morning the day the car was officially revealed.
