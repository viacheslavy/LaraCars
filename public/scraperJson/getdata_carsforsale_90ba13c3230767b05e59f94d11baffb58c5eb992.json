With rising gas prices and more strict emissions standards coming down on the manufacturers, the classic muscle car was struggling to survive. This GTO though, put up a good fight against the changing times. The 400 CID V8 in this car was producing around 300 horsepower and had aggressive looking body lines. This GTO has a freshly rebuilt 400 engine that runs great and produces a ton of power. The body work was touched up and the interior was completely redone in 2004 including custom seats. In 2008 there was new suspension installed, bushings were replaced, and the car had a very nicely done paint job. If you are looking for a classic muscle car to take to shows or burn up some back country roads this GTO is a great choice for you. This vehicle is located in our Milwaukee showroom. You can view this 1971 Pontiac GTO in greater detail including HD pictures and an HD video of it running and driving at Gatewayclassiccars.com.

The 4-4-2 name derives from the original set up of the first car that debuted in 1964. The set up was just that a 4 barrel carb, 4 speed transmission and dual exhaust. Pretty much everything desired on your first generation muscle cars. Many people, even to this day, think that 442 is the cubic displacement of the motor but in all reality Oldsmobile never made a 442 CID motor.  They did however make a 400 cubic inch big block and in 1965 it was the motor of choice for the Cutlass 442 cars. Now, being that you could get an automatic, the 4-4-2 stood for 400 CID, 4 barrell, dual exhaust. Sales would steadily rise through the first generations 4 year span topping out at a tad over 25000 units. The 1968 model year would see the 4-4-2 become its own model and not just an option any longer. This numbers matching 71 is a great example of these timeless machines. This 71 has gone through a complete frame off 3 year restoration with and even has some pictures to show the progress. The window sticker, original bill of sale, build sheet, and protecto plate are included adding to the authenticity of this rare collectible. With only 10 miles on the build since its completion you can tell this beauty has been pampered since its rescue. The bright white paint with black stripes looks just like it did when it left the factory over 45 years ago. The white vinyl top not only works effortlessly but looks great against the extra slick paint. Pop the hood and the 340 HP 455 cid motor looks right at home, especially with the period correct blue paint on the block and valve covers. Mated up to the original turbo 400 this is one of the easiest driving big block muscle cars you ever drive. WIth the huge amount of torque being produced, these 442's were known for laying down some of the nasty burnouts. What this car was really made for, is top down cruising and this one exceutes that perfectly. The radial tires add to the smooth ride and with the luxury of power steering and power brakes you might forget you\u00c3\u00a2??re in a 45 year old classic. Options on this 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass 442 Convertible include; AM/FM radio, Power convertible top, power steering, power brakes, black vinyl interior, seat belts, and Radial tires with Factory Rally Wheels.

You know that the owner J.R. is the resident Mustang nut of the shop.  He is very happy to bring you this 1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1.  This is a sweet looking car from 20 feet or 2 feet away.  The fit and finish on the car really stands tall.  The paint presents itself very well.  This car is a driver, so as always, we bring your quality cars, but this will have a rock chip or two because it has been driven and didn't just come out of the paint booth yesterday.  That said, this Mach 1 presents itself very well, and you would be proud to have it in your garage right now.      Now that this cool looking Mach 1 has drawn your attention to go look at it, pop open the hood and see that the 302 this car was born with is gone and a 351 Cleveland has been replaced between the shock towers.  This was the upgraded motor of choice in this era so this is a nice period correct upgrade.  This car is all business.  It was ordered back in the day with no frills that cost a lot of money back then.  No power steering, power brakes, or A/C.  However, with today's modern aftermarket parts catalogs that are out there, these things can be added to the car for not a lot of cost.  This motor runs very strong and will get you from A to B very efficiently.      Okay, so if you are a stang banger the way that some of us are here you just can't help yourself but to open up that driver door and slide yourself in to the comfortable seat.  Get yourself comfortable and get ready to hit that key.  You give the gas a couple pumps and turn that key over and you now hear that 351 come to life, and you hear that beautiful glass pack mufflers rumble out the back and you are going to have a hard time getting that ear to ear grin off of your face.  Throw the automatic shifter in to drive and get ready to go have a ton of fun, and get all the thumbs up that you can handle.      This car looks good, sounds good, and runs good.  The fun factor of this car is off the charts.  You can't be shy and drive this car.  We offer classic car financing for those of you that would like to take advantage of the offer.  They offer great rates and terms and allow you to pay of your sweet ride when you want to.  We look forward to speaking with you soon and we look forward to making you the newest member of the Just Toys Classic Cars family.      1971 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Blue Paint  Born 302, now 351 Cleveland   Automatic Rear Gears Unknown   Glass Pack Mufflers   4 wheel manual drum brakes   Manual steering   DISCLAIMER:    Before you buy any vehicle, sight unseen,  it is very important to ask as many questions as possible to make sure you are getting what you expect.  The majority of the customers that buy vehicles from us are very happy with their purchases.  We recommend that you should inspect cars in person before or have a professional appraisal company of your choice evaluate this vehicle and provide documentation"], "title": "1971 Ford Mustang ", "total_results": "713", "price": "25995", "kilometers": 58554.728, "total_pages": 31, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/27246878", "brand": "Ford", "reference_id": "27246878", "year": "1971", "model": "Mustang", "specs": {"Engine": "351 Cleveland", "Mileage": "36,392 miles", "Exterior Color": "", "Transmission": "3 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

Originally the car was powered by a 318.  Most would agree that the 318 is a great engine, to pull out and replace it.  What better engine to use than an original 426 Hemi from 1968.  In our minds, the best way to enjoy a Hemi is with a 4-speed.  Here you go, 4-speed transmission(new clutch and pressure plate) with a 3.91 gear set in an 8 3/4 rear end.  This makes for a very fun muscle car.  Equipment is minimal, but that seems appropriate for a Hemi powered muscle car.  It is equipped with power steering and an AM radio is in place, but why would you bother?  You have the music of the Hemi and a gas pedal for the volume control, that's all you need.  The paint will stop you in your tracks.  This is a very high quality paint job with hours upon hours of wet sanding and rubbing for a true show car shine.  Adding to the look is a set of MOPAR Rally wheels in 15\" with modern radial rubber, Hemi Billboard graphics and a black vinyl roof.  Inside is standard Barracuda with black vinyl seats, center console housing the 4-speed shifter and an array of gauges.  The interior is only 4 years old and looks great.The Hemi is equipped with Keith Black pistons and rings, an oversized camshaft and headers.  This beautiful Hemi powered Barracuda is priced far below the real deal allowing you to enjoy one of the greatest muscle cars to ever leave Detroit.

From the Grabber Yellow paint to the 8 track tape player. The front bumper was replaced with a chrome bumper for that fresh sparkly look. The engine has a rock solid idle and accelerates smoothly without a miss. The suspension is well sorted and handles nicely without worrisome noises. The interior was also done to completely original standards and fit and finish are great. If you are a fan of early 70\u00c3\u00a2??s Mustangs then you should not pass up the opportunity on this one. The features include AM Radio with 8 Track, Power Brakes, Power Steering, Seat Belts, Vinyl Interior, Radial Tires, and Rally Wheels.
