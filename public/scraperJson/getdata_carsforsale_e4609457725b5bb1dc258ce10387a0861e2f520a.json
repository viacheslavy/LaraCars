CYLINDER 210 HP REAR WHEEL DRIVE", "Wow what a spectacular find on this Camaro Convertible! This One Owner Camaro was bought back in 1967 on Dec. 24th, which is shown on original bill of sale. This would be a great car to add to your collection for Christmas!  We received a little spiral notebook that the owner has been writing in since 1967, with services he had done along with service records.  This is a well documented Camaro 327 V8 Convertible that has been very well kept it's whole life by one single owner.  This is an all original, numbers matching Camaro and it is in unbelieveable condition for never being restored.  The owner had done a respray in the orginal color about 5 years ago, to give it a fresh look.  The original interior is just as it was from the factory, including the very rare Automatic transmission with shifter on the column.  The only update we made was to put a new top on the vehicle, as that was about the only thing that really showed wear.  This Camaro was bought from a local WI Chevy dealer, as the original owner lived there at the time of purchase.  Shortly after purchase he moved to California and it has been in Los Angeles area it's whole life.  This is a a true survivor and time capsule!!  If you are looking for a great Camaro Convertible driver that is all original and has a well documented history, look no further!!

How about a genuine X11 car that has been upgraded to modern LS1 power, bold paint, and more modern technology than when it left the factory...that's what's truly superior.  ", "  There are zero worries that anyone will look at this coupe and think it's bone stock.  There were some yellows on the '69 Camaro color palette, but the luster you get off of the modern paint instantly let's everyone know this is more than just straight from the factory.  The investment in plenty of modern clearcoat even extends to the pained black dual stripes to give you a package that leaves an impression no matter if it's showcased in the sunlight, or moonlight.  And speaking of nighttime, if you choose, you're going to love cruising this coupe in the dark, because the multi-color LED lights under the car are a cool way to announce that this is a true restomod.  But even without the modern lights, this is an intimidating package.  You get the RS's blacked-out grille with hidden headlights, the power bulge of the cowl induction hood, and the full length D80 rear spoiler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all true hallmarks of the best first-gen Camaros.    ", "  Inside is very cool but subtle mixture of modern and original styles.  The best place to see this is on the front seats.  These buckets look like premium stock, but the condition is so nice you know there was some real investment in new covers.  Plus, the rear looks great with the custom yellow SS stitching.  You get the desirable factory center console that houses icons like the horseshoe shifter and quad auxiliary gauge package with some custom touches of carbon fiber.  Above that is an AM/FM/CD stereo.  And the treats for the driver don't end there.  You get a custom wood and aluminum sports steering wheel with a Chevy bow tie etched in the center.  Beyond that are the white-faced Dakota Digital gauges that provide a clear view of the large speedo and tach.  This kind of setup is perfectly paired for the highly desireable upgrade under the hood.  ", "  While you'll love showing off the interior and exterior, we bet it's the engine bay that you're going to be showcasing the most.  The yellow and black color scheme that's been everywhere on this car so far is repeated under the hood with dark black hoses and fender walls joined by the bright yellow firewall.  And of course, everyone will also instantly marvel at the custom engine covers and alternator that adds a cool wet look to the exterior yellow. But more than just appearance, you are looking at a modern fuel-injected powerplant.  The heart of this beast is an upgraded 5.7-liter LS1 V8.  Beyond just adding a naturally high performance motor, this one has been upgraded with go-fast goodies.  It inhales deeply from Spectre intake, and the V8 exhales with authority through headers connected to a stainless steel dual exhaust with performance X-pipe construction.  But besides just having a wicked growl, it can keep cool while running"], "title": "1969 Chevrolet Camaro ", "total_results": "718", "price": "43995", "kilometers": "", "total_pages": 31, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/29972716", "brand": "Chevrolet", "reference_id": "29972716", "year": "1969", "model": "Camaro", "specs": {"Engine": "LS1 5.7 Liter V8", "Mileage": "", "Exterior Color": "Yellow", "Transmission": "4 Speed Automatic", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

With a 302 rated at 290 horsepower and an option of 4-speed manual transmissions, lots of racing, both legal and otherwise, has been done in these machines over the years.  This example started life as a Rallye Green, but has since been painted this beautiful coat of Dark Metallic Blue.  Unfortunately, as is not uncommon with these street legal racecars, the original \u00c3\u00a2??DZ\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d coded engine was damaged and replaced with a 302 CID engine rebuilt to factory specifications.  The M21 4-speed is believed to be original to the vehicle, as well as the 3.73 12-bolt rear axle.The standard black buckets are in fantastic shape and show minimal wear.  The dash layout brings back a time of simplicity with large, easy to read gauges showing your current speed, the time, and engine speed.  The lenses are all clear, giving you an unobstructed view to the vitals of your engine.  The shifter sits at the perfect altitude to let you dominate the gears.  Whether just cruising along, enjoying the sights and sounds of your town, or barreling down the track, hunting for quicker times, this machine does it all...Options on this beautiful \u00c3\u00a2??69 Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 include: AM/FM/Cassette, Power Brakes, Seat Belts, Vinyl Interior, Radial Tires with Raised White Letters, and Rallye WheelsThis vehicle is located in our Milwaukee showroom.

Production in 1967 finished at 220,906 and 235,147 for 1968.  The Mustang lost 135,447 sales from 1966 to 1967 and in 1968 lost another 154,717.  The Camaro was without question a big player in this new market and still is today.  The first-generation Camaro is certainly one of most recognizable and sought after cars from this era.  The '68 that we have listed here is a very well restored car that runs as well as it looks.  The restoration was completed in 2002 but looks as if it was completed yesterday.  The engine is a 350 and was recently freshened up with a mild cam and has just over 2,600 miles on it. Backing up the engine is a TH-350.  Paint is a beautiful and eye catching Electric Blue with Pearl White stripes and classic Rally Wheels with BFGoodrich Radial T/As.  Inside is a very clean and presentable black vinyl interior and is equipped with seat belts, bucket seats, center console and an AM/FM radio.  Other equipment includes Power steering and Power brakes.  For more information on this 1968 Chevrolet Camaro, call 618-271-3000 or stop by our St. Louis showroom.

Finished in correct Grotto Blue over black interior, no expense was spared in creating this stunning drop-top classic.", "Although the appearance remains refreshingly stock with Rally wheels and a subtle spear stripe, the driving dynamics far exceed anything that left Norwood in the 1960s. Under the hood is a built 427 with an Edelbrock Performer RPM cam, Demon carb, MSD ignition, Hooker headers and a nice dress-up kit. The monster engine is mated to a five-speed Tremec transmission that feeds power to the 12-bolt posi rear end. All that power makes it to the ground with the help of traction bars, subframe connectors and meaty BFGs. Full stainless exhaust sounds great without being obnoxious. Stopping is aided by four-wheel hydroboost disk brakes. All suspension and steering components were new or rebuilt when this car was restored 4,100 miles ago.  It's wickedly fast but the suspension and braking upgrades handle the big power with confidence.", "Paint, body, underside and interior show to a nice standard. The only notable interior deviation from stock is the Autometer gauge pack with provides a clear view of the vitals -- the original gauge cluster is included. The convertible top was replaced when the car was restored and the power mechanism works properly. Factory A/M radio is still in the dash -- it was likely never replaced because the motor sounds so good. Original owner's manual, protect-o-plate and a four-inch-thick binder of records are included with the sale.
