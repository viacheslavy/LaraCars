It used the same styling, body and structure of the 911 except it was lighter and more nimble.  It outsold the 911 for a couple years until mindsets caught up with the technology and price of the 911.  It was produced initially from 1965 through 1969 until the 914 was debuted as Porsches entry level model.  It was later brought back for a one-year only after the 914 was discontinued in 1976.  The 912's are becoming harder and harder to find in stock original condition because they were the cheaper cars and people were not afraid to cut them up and turn them in to race and rally cars.  This particular highly original car except for a passenger side re-spray more than 35 years ago is a excellent example that we are pleased to present.  This 912 is a rare early example that has its original owners manuals, keys and books. It is believed to be a three owner car with the last owner having the car in his possession for more that 34 years.  Receipts dating back to the 1980's accompany the car as well as the COA showing color code 6602 (ruby red) with black leatherette which it still retains. In fact, the entire interior is original.  The COA also shows production date of 10/6/65. Title lists this car as a 1965 but was more than likely a 1966 ''Model'' year.  Engine number and Transmission number are not confirmed on the COA but date coded correct for a 912.  The optional equipment is a Webasto Heater and Blaupunkt Radio.
