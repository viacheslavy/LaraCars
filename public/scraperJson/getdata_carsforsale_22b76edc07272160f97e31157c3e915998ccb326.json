Many wouldn't look twice at a Firebird with a six cylinder, but in the case of the Firebird Sprint, Pontiac made quite an interesting six cylinder package.  The idea came from Pontiac executive John Z. Delorean.  Yes, the same Delorean that dreamed up the gull winged stainless steel icon that eventually went back in time.  Delorean pushed the idea of a compact six because it kept the front end weight down and allowed for a better handling vehicle.  This was not the economy based inline sixes American cars typically had in the day.  This was a 250 CID (4.1 Liter) Overhead Cam inline six.  The engine was equipped with a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor which brought the horsepower rating up to 215 on cars with an automatic transmission.  Just under 2,000 Firebird Sprints were ever ordered, and less than 500 came with an automatic transmission.  This particular Sprint is equipped with the 2 speed Power glide transmission.  With power steering, power brakes, and a smooth running and quiet engine, this car is a dream to drive.  The exterior is finished in green with a black vinyl top.  Couple that with a set of Pontiac rally  wheels and you have one sweet looking Pontiac.  This one is amazingly only on its third owner since new, and the odometer is believed to be original mileage at 113,432.  The vehicle has clearly been well cared for over the years, and should be ready for many more years of enjoyment.  This would be a great entry level classic for someone new to the hobby, but would be at home in an avid collectors garage as well.  Located in our St. Louis Showroom, this 1968 Pontiac Firebird Sprint can be seen including 100+ HD pictures and video at www.GatewayClassicCars.com.

It offers a strong-running 400, bright red paint, and that undeniable performance look that makes these cars perennial favorites. So if you're a Pontiac guy or just someone who's tired of '69 Camaros, perhaps this is the solution.  ", "  The restoration was done some years ago, but since then, this Firebird has lived a pretty easy life. The bright red paint is racy and aggressive, not silly, and on the Firebird shape it looks like the ideal choice, which was Pontiac's goal all along. It's two-stage urethane on top of some reasonably good bodywork, so it has a high-performance look that's evident even from a distance, and when you get up close the little details start to stand out. They didn't do any modifications, no scoops or wings, and kept the factory-style 400 badges on the hood, as well as the bright chrome beak that gives the Firebird a very different look from its corporate cousin. The side marker lights that are actually little firebirds themselves are perhaps the coolest ever invented and the clean overall look makes this car stand out in a sea of Brand-X F-bodies.  ", "  The interior is a little less vivid but no less attractive. Factory buckets with reproduction seat covers anchor one of the better places to get some road work done. Basic black is the overall theme, although it is a Pontiac, so there's a bit of simulated burled walnut there, too. Factory gauges are joined by auxiliary dials on the console ahead of the shifter, along with an AM/FM/cassette stereo head unit in the dash. Door panels and carpets were replaced at the time of restoration and the wood-rimmed steering wheel is a recent addition that adds a bit of elegance. It's all clean, simple, and well-executed, making this Firebird a great car to drive and enjoy. Even the trunk is in good order, although a replacement mat would be a good first purchase to really dress things up and add value.  ", "  Pontiac's 400 cubic inch V8 is well-known and well-regarded in performance circles, and in the lightweight Firebird, performance is impressive. This car originally came with a 350, so the 400 is an upgrade that makes a big difference in performance. Thanks to an Edelbrock carburetor, aluminum intake manifold, and Accel distributor, it's ready to drive and enjoy. The engine bay continues the clean, no-nonsense theme with blue engine enamel, along with chrome valve covers, matching air cleaner, and a few other bright pieces. Power steering works with the TH400 3-speed automatic transmission to make this car easy to drive, while long-tube headers and brand new Flowmaster mufflers give it that notorious sound we all love so much. The underside is in good order, albeit not detailed for show, but no worries about nailing the throttle and having some fun.

This one is a numbers matching car and the engine was rebuilt. 1968 marked the year of Hey Jude by the Beatles being released for the first time and Bullitt was in theaters! What a year for cars it was. This car has not been restored and is ready to be perfected or simply driven. The transmission shifts smooth and the engine makes great power. All 1967\u00c3\u00a2?\"1968 400 CID V8 engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetor's second barrel from fully opening. It makes you wonder what the car would make with it opened! The car is not the original color and was repainted over 30 years ago. This car is optioned with AC, AM radio, convertible auto top, power steering, vinyl interior and rally style wheels. The current owner of this vehicle has owned it for over 30 years. It has 108,800 miles on it since it was new and this is believed to be the actual mileage. The styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of Federally-mandated side marker lights: for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door vent-windows were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system.

And so when you find out that it has the powerful 400 V8, four-on-the-floor, and plenty of other great features, you might not even finish all the details before you're rushing down here.  ", "  The key to this car's appeal is the first impression that it makes. First off, we all love the look of these first-generation Firebirds. The shining front bumper is so nicely integrated into the design as it both frames the grille and creates an apex for the crease on the aggressive dual scoop hood.  The profile continues the sleek sheetmetal with nicely defined creases and sporty fender scallops.  And It finishes with a full-length rear spoiler and those iconic thin taillights.  But this one goes beyond just legendary style.  Often muscle cars grab attention with a bold color like red or black.  We love that look, but this one just does it in such a different way that makes it a shining star, literally.  The silver paint has plenty of metal flake and modern cleracoat, so that when you take it out into the sunlight, it has a true radiating presence.  ", "  When you open the door, you also can tell there was plenty invested on the interior, too.  The inside was given a complete color change to the black we all love to see on muscle machines.  So the seats, carpeting, door panels, headliner, dash, and everything else feels exceptionally fresh and complete.  This is a comfortable center console car that is topped off with an auxiliary gauge trio and Hurst shifter.  Like a good sports car, the driver's focus is on the deep dual-pod readouts viewed through the three-spoke sports steering wheel.  Looking for a tach? This has one of Pontiac's ultra cool hood-mounted units.    ", "  The top motor for the first-generation Firebird was the 400 cubic-inch V8, so it's great to have that correct displacement under the hood.  The motor is presented exceptionally nicely with the correct blue on the block, and the air topper and valve covers boldly proclaim the big V8's size.  It inhales deeply with a four-barrel carburetor and hi-rise intake, and exhales with authority out of an X-pipe dual exhaust.  And the best part is you are in complete control of the power and its soundtrack thanks to the four-speed manual transmission. In fact, this car is all about keeping you connected with the road. And while you feel its muscle car strength, the BF Goodrich tires mounted on the iconic Rally II wheels give you firm control.  ", "  Complete with original paperwork, including warranty info, title docs, and Protect-O-Plate, this is a very cool big V8 Firebird. So since it's offered at a gone-tomorrow price, you need to hurry up and call today!"], "title": "1969 Pontiac Firebird ", "total_results": "69", "price": "28995", "kilometers": 77832.157, "total_pages": 4, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/28199478", "brand": "Pontiac", "reference_id": "28199478", "year": "1969", "model": "Firebird", "specs": {"Engine": "400 V8", "Mileage": "48,373 miles", "Exterior Color": "Silver Metallic", "Transmission": "4 Speed Manual", "Interior Color": "Black", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}}
