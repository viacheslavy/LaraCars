Caliente which translates to \"Red Hot\" in spanish, and just so happens to be perfect for this 65' Comet. Powered by a Roush built 289 CID V8 that produces 305 horsepower and 317 ft-lb of torque. Options for this 1965 Mercury Comet Caliente include: AM Radio, Power Steering, Tilt Wheel, Seat Belts, Vinyl Interior, Radial Tires, and Magnum 500 Aluminum/Alloy Wheels. Only 50 miles has been put on this 65' Comet since the completion of this beautiful restoration. A Holley 600 CFM carburetor sits atop the Roush built 289 CID V8 which also features an Edelbrock billet fuel filter and braided line, an MSD Pro-Billet distributor, an ARP head and main bolts, and of course the Roush signature valve covers and air filter. The block was bored and honed .030 over, the reconditioned heads underwent a 3 angle valve job, and were reassembled with new stainless steel valves and premium hardware including hydraulic roller springs. The crankshaft was also reconditioned to a grind variance of .010\"/.010\" and balance rotating assembly. The final assembly of the engine was complete with Comp Cams small base circle hydraulic roller cam and tie bar lifters, Ford Motorsport timing set, Scorpion roller rocker arms, Wiseco forged pistons, Eagle 4340 H-beam rods, Melling high volume oil pump, Canton Racing Products 8 qt. road race oil pan and pickup tube, and an Edelbrock Performer RPM intake manifold. The custom ceramic coated headers look amazing and run to the full 2 1/2 inch stainless steel exhaust for an awesome sound.  A 4 speed Top Loader transmission with a Hurst shifter featuring a hydraulic clutch has been employed to transfer the power to the new 9\" Curric limited Posi-Trac rear end assembly which features the Performance Axle Package and a 3.50 gear ratio. Wilwood 4 wheel disc brakes not only look amazing but they do an excellent job of stopping this resto-mod when needed. The front suspension features powder coated tubular A-arm and coil overs, with coil overs in the rear suspension as well this Caliente Comet handles like a dream. The re-chromed front and rear bumpers with the all new chrome and stainless trim looks phenomenal against the masterful black paint. The interior of this Beautiful Comet was is just as nice as the outside and engine bay. The black with red trim vinyl interior looks like it has never been sat in and is a perfect complement to the build.

", "  The Cyclone represents the top end of Comet range.  While this was meant to showcase the sporting aspects of short wheelbase Mercury, the factory-correct Polar White paint can't help but add plenty of sophistication.  Of course it helps that there was a professional respray during its lifetime.  Plus, those extra wide chrome bumpers have a mirror-like presence thanks to recently being re-chromed.  But even without the investments in this coupe, it still has a huge desirability factor.  Averaging less than 1,200 miles annually over the last half-century means someone has cared for this Comet correctly.  The grille seems inspired by the Lincoln Continental; the sheetmetal has a sweeping line stamped into the profile; and the three-element taillight panel is pure '60s cool.  None of this would be so striking as it is today if it were not for such careful previous ownership.  But we can understand exactly why such great care has gone into this coupe.  Mercury produced less than 7,500 Comet Cyclones in '64, and so you'll be hard-pressed to find a nicer survivor.  ", "  The Cyclone's interior announces its sporty nature from the moment you open the door.  Bucket seats and a center console are the kind of features we would all love on a cool classic.  Plus, the white vinyl with chrome accents is always in style (and black carpeting means you don't have to take your shoes off before hopping in.)  Best of all, the interior is believed to be original to the car, and its stellar condition is likely due to the fact that low mileage means little seat time.  The three-spoke steering wheel is part of the upgraded Comet package, and so is the standard tachometer.  While this all presents as a great time capsule (right down to the stylized gauge cluster,) there are a few welcomed subtle upgrades.  For example, there is a digital temperature readout added for the most accurate info on the motor.  Plus, the factory AM radio looks great in its stock location, but you'll be happy the real tunes come from a modern AM/FM/CD stereo hidden in the glove box.  ", "  This Mercury was originally produced with the 220hp K-code 289 V8. And before you ask, yes, it's believed that that same motor still is in the engine bay today.  Just like the rest of the coupe, the engine bay looks fantastically original, right down to the FoMoCo coolant bag.  The V8 has a proper Ford Autolite 4100 series four-barrel carburetor that helps develop the burly power, but remember this is still a Mercury at heart.  That means a single exhaust for a more subtle growl, and the three-speed automatic, and power steering, are all part of this more civil execution.  Quite frankly this all makes for a very interesting package where, just like the paint, there is nice performance that's mixed with a more sophisticated presence.  ", "  While all this was already exceptionally desirable, this Mercury also comes with paperwork like the original window sticker, bill of sale, and plenty of maintenance receipts.

With a timeless triple black color combination, an appealing upscale interior, and a thrifty drivetrain, it's a hobby car you can enjoy without guilt.  ", "  The idea of the small car isn't a new one, and even upscale Mercury was getting in on the act with the Comet. It offers styling cues taken from the full-sized machines sitting next to it in the showroom, but thanks to compact proportions, it was easy to drive and remarkably quick, even when equipped with a six-cylinder engine. This one shows good straight bodywork thanks to a lifetime in the south, and dressing it up in black makes it look bigger and more upscale than you'd expect. Dramatically carved sheetmetal was all-new in 1965, making it look more like its big brothers and less like an economy car, and most folks won't recognize it when they first see it. Chrome and trim are quite good, and even on the budget-oriented Comet, there's quite a bit of it, including the big bumpers and ornate grille up front. The stainless trim on the front fenders and ornate fluted taillight lenses give the Comet a lot of visual pizzazz that make it look more expensive than it is.  ", "  The attractive black interior is another way in which the Comet looks like it should cost way more than it does. One look at the tasteful black vinyl and cloth upholstery with its square stitching instantly reminds you of the other more expensive cars in the Mercury lineup, and that's completely on purpose. The cloth inserts make the interior comfortable even on warm days with the top down, and while it's not totally correct, it certainly looks right. Matching door panels are stylish for a basic car, and we're guessing they were restored when the seats were upgraded. The instrument panel is a handsome and functional design that includes wood appliques for warmth a full set of gauges that are remarkably complete for such an affordable machine. The original AM radio is in the center of the dash, although it's probably due for an upgrade, and the trunk comes complete with a full-sized spare and jack assembly. A luxurious black canvas convertible top was recently installed, and includes a crystal clear rear window and matching black boot.  ", "  Ford's trusty 200 cubic inch inline fits neatly with the Comet's economy-based mission. It appears to be the original engine, but in 1965, Ford Motor Company wasn't stamping numbers on blocks, so it's impossible to say. It delivers bright performance in the lightweight Mercury and you'll recall that the 1965 Mustang was based on this same platform. Bright red paint on the valve cover and air cleaner makes the machinery stand out against the satin black engine bay, and while it's not detailed for show, it does have a factory look that helps give it camouflage.

Based on the newly restyled Comet, with its Lincoln-style front end and crisp overall styling, the Cyclone was initially available as a 2-door hardtop coupe with an aggressive attitude courtesy of reduced bright trim, chrome reverse-style wheel covers and 289 small block V8 power. Other sporty Cyclone features included contoured bucket seats, special nameplates and full lower body side moldings, available vinyl roof coverings, plus a floor console, tachometer, and three spoke steering wheel. Under hood, the Cyclone's engine included special chromed valve covers, air cleaner, dipstick and chromed oil filter and radiator covers.   If anyone mistook the Comet Cyclone for a high style poser, the little Mercury carried plenty of punch. In fact, the cars basic design was prover over the highly publicized Comet Durability Run, with a team of Comets racking up 100,000 miles on Daytona's legendary oval. On America's drag strips, supercharged Comet race cars ran in A/FX, the wild stock bodied precursor to AA/FC Funny cars, in the hands of Sox and Martin and Jack Chrisman, while their Ford Fairlane stablemates ran in Super Stock. Of all Comet models produced,t he Cyclone was quite rare when new with just 7,454 build in all for 1964. However, while Mercury was a successful jewel in Ford's corporate crown, it had virtually no marketing budget for 1964, with all available marketing resources monopolized by the Ford Mustang's launch campaign. However, Mercury's racing director Fran Hernandez overcame the corporate rivalry with massive free press generated from the upstart Ford divisions racing success.  Ford's hot solid-lifter \"k-Code\" 289 V8 engine was initially advertised by Mercury for the 1964 Comet, but after tooling was already made and dealer brochures printed, Ford limited Mercury to the 210-horsepower \"D-Code\" 289. Hernandez instructed his engineers to improvise, so they took the plentiful 600-CFM Autolite carburetor from the parts bin and upgraded the Mercury 289 into a deeper breathing, hot performing rival to Ford's K-Code 289, which was limited by its smaller 470-CFM carb. Interestingly, this special and rare Mercury only 289 engine was given the \"K\" code and it slipped right under the noses for Ford's top brass! Also known as the \"Cyclone Super\" V8, this special \"K\" 289 turned the lightweight Comet into a street and strip terror capable of bumbling many far more powerful \"on paper\" opponents. Unlike Ford's top 289 in the he Fairlane, Mercury's \"K\" engine was also available with the C-4 automatic transmission, causing many buyers to choose a new Mercury instead.   Carrying the \"K\" digit in the fifth position of its VIN, this very rare 1964 Mercury Comet Cyclone is confirmed as a top-of-the-line, factory built Cyclone Super 289-powered car with the special 600-CFM autolite 4-barrel carburetor. It is California-titled, with history dating to its original sale when new by G.K. Hardt Lincoln-Mercury of Santa Rosa, California to A.J. Anderson of Kenwood, California, as confirmed by the original warranty information. Highlights include recently re-upholstered seats, power steering and brakes, a Merc-O-Matic tree speed automatic transmission and the very rare and correct Mercury Comet Cyclone air cleaner assembly. Complete with the original owner's manual, plus a great collection of original Mercury Comet posters, articles and sales brochures. As such, this Cyclone Super 289-powered 1964 Mercury Comet Cyclone convertible stands as truly outstanding, investment grade example of one of Mercury's hottest and most desirable 1960's models."], "title": "1964 Mercury Comet ", "total_results": "56", "price": "47500", "kilometers": "", "total_pages": 4, "href": "https://www.carsforsale.com/vehicle/details/28159664", "brand": "Mercury", "reference_id": "28159664", "year": "1964", "model": "Comet", "specs": {"Engine": "8", "Mileage": "", "Exterior Color": "White", "Transmission": "Automatic", "Interior Color": "Other", "Drive Train": "", "Fuel": ""}},

The vehicle name was introduced in 1955 and applied to Mercury's premium automobile line.

Montclair\u00c3\u00a2??s featured Mercury's best appointments, extra chrome trim, and different two-tone paint combinations to set them apart from other Mercury products.  This survivor car has 51603 original miles on her and she still looks great!  Powered by a 390 CID V8 that is paired to a 3-speed automatic transmission.  The car was repainted 3 years ago, in resale red and shows very well. The green interior is also in great condition with vinyl seats, door panels, headliner, & green dash.  The car features its original mercury hub cabs wrapped in Hanook tires.  Other features include AC (working), AM radio, & power steering. Newly replaced items include power steering hoses, new carburetor, fuel tank, fuel pump, new brakes, & new tires.  This is a true survivor car and you could be the lucky one to own it!
