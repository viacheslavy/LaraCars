Collectors have discovered that nobody did luxury and muscle better, and so innovative cars like this 1960 Pontiac Bonneville are at the top of the Pontiac collectability charts. Add in impressive factory colors inside and out and the ultra desirable triple-duce carbs under the hood, and this is your perfect distinctive classic.", "With only about 17,000 examples, this was one of the most expensive and lowest production number Pontiacs for 1960.  So just imagine how few you see today, especially in this exceptional condition.  The factory-correct Skymist Blue paint job is bright and sophisticated at the same time, especially when the color-coordinating light blue top is in place.  But it's much more than just distinctive paint that will turn heads with this one. The top-of-the-line Bonneville meant plenty of delicate trim, and amazingly, this car still wears all of it over 55 years later.  The new bold front end for 1960, the double-dipping chrome bumper in front, and the fins that run the whole length of the rear \u2013 it all means that nobody will mistake this for anything but a senior Pontiac.", "Some people want a triple-black car, but just imagine their surprise when you show them triple-blue just in the interior.  This leather seating is exactly the kind of upgrade that came from the bold and daring Pontiac.  It coordinates nicely with the door panels, carpeting, and dash for a true uniform appearance.  You slip behind the wheel for true 1960s magic. After all, no other period could bring you the cool blue steering wheel with clear upper section.  The stylized dash give you a full readout and then tapers like a lake feeding a stream across the rest of the dash that houses the heat/defrost controls and Wonderbar AM radio (an FM receiver was also added later.)", "Under the hood is a very honest 389 cubic-inch block with some very nice upgrades.  We know you spotted the fined bright valve covers, and of course, no one can miss the performance upgrades like the bold Tri-Power carb setup. But more than just big horsepower, power brakes and steering make travel easy.  And it's all backed by a Hydramatic transmission with surprisingly quick reflexes for a vintage gearbox.  Grip is well in hand with modern BF Goodrich T/A rubber.  Those are utilized on the cool factory eight-lug wheels, which are probably worth a small fortune all by themselves.", "This Pontiac is the best of everything blue.
