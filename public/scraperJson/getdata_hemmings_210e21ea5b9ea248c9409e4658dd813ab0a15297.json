Formerly on consignment to us, we have just purchased this car from its long term owner and have lowered the price as well.  The car received a rotisserie restoration and we have photo documentation available covering the restoration process.  The engine was rebuilt with modest performance upgrades including camshafts, electronic ignition, and a big bore stainless steel exhaust system.  Mechanical components addressed during the restoration also included a new clutch kit, and Koni shocks front and rear.  The brake hydraulics were rebuilt or replaced and suspension rebuilt with new bushings and ball joints.   It has new Dayton chrome wire wheels shod with Pirelli P6000 tires.  The restoration was done with appropriate attention to detail even including original style hose clamps.  The car is flawless in panel fit, panel integrity, color consistency and gloss.  She is truly beautiful and many agree there is no prettier color combination than its Opalescent Silver blue and over dark blue leather.  Driving this car is indeed a pleasurable experience.  Besides great power and handling, it exhibits a new car like tightness.  There are no rattles or squeaks and it is truly a great driver.  This Jaguar's Heritage Certificate confirms it was built in December of 1967.  These cars were often called Series 1 1/2 or 1.5 although that was never an official Jaguar designation. The factory still considered them a Series 1.  However, to meet U.S emissions and safety regulations starting in January of 1968, this car was originally equipped with open headlamps and dual Stromberg carburetors.  In this case, the restorer brought back the purity of the original design by converting it to covered headlamps.  It was also restored with power to match its styling. The engine was rebuilt with triple S.U. carburetors and other performance enhancements.  Thus in this car, you have one of the last E-types produced in calendar year 1967 with the pure original E-type styling plus smile inducing power that well exceeds the original.  The car has a correct E-type 4.2 series 1 engine although it is not original to the car.  As such you\u2019re getting an E-type in what many consider the ultimate specification of 4.2 engine, triple carburetors, and covered headlamp bonnet but for literally tens of thousands less than what original 4.2 covered headlamp cars demand in today\u2019s market.
