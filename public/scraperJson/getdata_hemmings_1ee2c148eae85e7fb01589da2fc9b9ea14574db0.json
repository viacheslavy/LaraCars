This is a 1967 Chevy Impala SS 427.  It's a real RPO Z24 427 Super Sport.  There were only 2,124 of these cars ever produced.  This one was originally a California car before moving to Tennessee.

This is easily one of, if not the best original paint cars I've ever seen.  You read that right, this car features the original Ermine White paint.  It shows beautifully with some general aging, but has been well taken care of over the years.  The body is super solid with excellent fit of all the panels.  The Chrome and Stainless on this '67 appears to be all original.  There is a couple of spots down low on the bumpers along with the Vent Windows that are aged, but for original it's some of the best you'll see.  This SS has the T3 Headlights and rare Domed Hood.  Also, it's got the distinctive SS badges and black lower body trim.  To finish off the look it's sitting on a set of 15'' Bolt-On Aluminum '67 Vette Wheels with Redline Radial Tires.", "Next, we will look at the interior of the Super Sport.  As you open the door you'll see that it's done in the Bright Blue which is a gorgeous complement to the exterior.  What's even better is that it's mostly all original.  It comes with Bucket Seats and Console along with the Tilt Column and Wood Rimmed 3 Spoke Sport Wheel.  When you sit down you'll notice the driver seat is Power.  You'll also see all the lights are working from the headliner to the console.  Looking at the dash you can see it has been upgraded with the Dakota Digital VHX Gauges.  The original push button AM FM Radio is still working, and the seat covers, headliner, and carpet are all very nice for their age.", "Finally, we will get to the heartbeat of the Chevrolet.  As you raise the Domed Hood you will see the Matching Numbers 385 HP 427 Engine.  It has the date code correct Heads and Intake with a Quadrajet Four Barrel carb.  This is a factory AC Car that is all there and works great.  Also, it has Power Steering and Power Brakes.  The brakes have been upgraded with Disc on all Four Corners.  The engine is mated to the 700R Trans and the date code correct 12 Bolt Posi Rear with 3.07 Gears.  For exhaust, it flows thru manifolds with 2 \u00bd'' Stainless Pipes and Magnaflow Mufflers.  Now when you look under this Impala all the floors and frame are awesome.  They are all original and to paint them would have taken away from what this car stands for.  The front end has had new ball joints installed along with end link and control arm bushings.  Now this 427 Super Sport does have the heavy-duty suspension that has been upgraded with a rear Hotchkiss sway bar and Bilstein shocks on all four corners.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.

The factory A/C blows cold and original documentation to back everything up. Code F Marina Blue is this cars original color and when it looks this good you keep it. The bodywork is simply fantastic and thats no easy feat on a car with quarter panels as big as the side of a school bus. Tight gaps and lots of attention to detail make it look almost new. This Impala has a high performance look that suits the hardware underneath.By 1967 bucket seats werent the exclusive domain of the SS and this full-sized cruiser got a code 810-D black vinyl front bench with individual backrests that look a lot like buckets. Of course all the upholstery has been properly restored with correct patterns and materials giving it a very elegant look. New carpets and door panels certainly help with the showroom feel and the big bold gauges look to have been professionally restored. The vents on the dash indicate factory A/C which has been upgraded to R134a refrigerant and blows ice cold today. Other options include power windows a rear defogger and a tilt steering column plus the more recent addition of an AM/FM/CD/iPod stereo system in a custom console that also includes built-in cup holders. Heck even the clock works! As youd expect the back seat is big enough for full-sized adults and the trunk is positively gigantic even with the full-sized spare up in the front. The engine is an original numbers-matching L35 396 cubic inch V8. Rated at 325 horsepower its no slouch in the performance department and makes the big coupe feel a thousand pounds lighter than it is. The engine compartment is beautifully detailed and doesnt deviate from the factory look in any way. Check out the OEM air cleaner with reproduction decals the hoses with proper stamping and correct tower hose clamps and painted valve covers not chrome. It runs superbly and idles like a luxury car not a muscle machine and thanks to a 700R4 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission its one of the best highway cruisers weve ever driven. Of course as a big block Impala a 12-bolt rear end was standard equipment and it exhales through a great-sounding Flowmaster exhaust system with tips just under the rear bumper. This wasnt a rotisserie restoration but when the underside looks this good theres just no reason to take the car apart at the molecular level. They did however add a set of handsome 15-inch Torque Thrust wheels and wrapped them in staggered 245/60/15 front and 275/60/15 rear performance radials.

The stainless down the sides has been cleaned and polished as well as the trim around the glass that also looks good.  A new Black Vinyl top was installed at the time of the resto.  It complements the Bolero Red Body color that has a deep rich shine and is smooth to the touch with a nice job being done in the jams and in the trunk.  The bumpers have either been rechromed or replaced along with other chrome trim.  The weather stripping was replaced around the doors and trunk as well as the roof rail rubber.  To finish off the exterior its sitting on a set of factory Rallys with rings and caps and a set of red line tires.", "Next, we will take a look at the interior of the '67.  On the inside it's in great condition and done in the factory color scheme.  It has the Parchment Bench seats and door panels.  The carpet, headliner, and dash are done in black.  When you look at the dash it's all stock with the factory AM Radio.  It does have the Rosewood Steering Wheels and it retains the stock style seat belts.", "Finally, we will take a look at the heartbeat of the Chevy.  Under the hood it's powered by a 283 V8 that's mated to a Powerglide Trans and a 10 Bolt Rear End.  The engine looks as it would have in '67 with the stock Two Barrel Carb, stock valve covers and breather.  Also it retains the stock manifolds with the single exhaust.  This Impala comes with Power Brakes with disc up front as well as Power steering.  The engine bay is well detailed and when you look under it the floors and frame all appear solid.", "If we can help you in any way with questions or a specific picture, you can call our office at (865)988-8088.

Maybe survival rates are low but we suspect that the guys who own these cars love them so much they just don't want to let them go. And with this car's strong-running big block, a 4-speed, and a top that goes down, it's easy to understand why they're so beloved.", "There's nothing that says summertime better than a big convertible with a big engine, and this handsome Imp wears code C Ermine White better than most. It's not perfect today but a professional buff would really wake up the paint, which is why white is so easy to work with. This car isn't far from being amazing. Better yet, all the bodywork is in excellent shape, with those creases looking sharp enough to give you a paper cut and good gaps that suggest this convertible has led an easy life. White paint accentuates the car's understated good looks and this is a real SS, so the badges on the grille and deck lid are legit and those '396' emblems on the front fenders might constitute a threat in some counties. It continues the Impala's three-element taillight with a stylized version of the look and all the chrome and stainless trim sparkles against the bodywork with a very period-appropriate shine. It's hard to not get attention in this car.", "The code 813 black bucket seat interior is mostly original save for new seat covers and as an SS, the buckets and console were standard equipment. It's awesome to see a console and a 4-speed in a full-sized cruiser like this, and for being 50 years old, it really looks good. Those new seat covers are in excellent condition with few signs of use and no UV damage, the dash pad hasn't been dried out by the sun, and the back seat looks hardly used. Big, round gauges cover the basics and still look great, and the woodgrained steering wheel helps soften the all-black passenger compartment. You also get an AM/FM radio with a very rare 8-track unit on the center console and a nice black power convertible top with matching boot. In back, there's a cavernous trunk that's neatly finished with a proper mat and a full-sized spare tire with jack assembly.", "It's powered by its original, numbers-matching 396 cubic inch V8, which, according to the air cleaner is an L35 325 horsepower version. It's been dressed the way the factory intended, with plain valve covers, a single-snorkel air cleaner, and proper decals on top. Chevy Orange paint pops against the satin black engine bay and there's nothing like a big block Chevy V8 for smooth torque production, even in a big ragtop like this. The only upgrades are a Holley 4-barrel carburetor and an HEI ignition system, and the power brake booster was recently replaced. The 4-speed manual gearbox is a blast to run through the gears, especially in such a big car, and the rear end seems to have some relatively tall gears in it, so this cruiser just loafs along on the highway. A stock-spec dual exhaust system gives it a bit of a muscular voice but never gets too aggressive and there's still nothing that rides like a full-sized American ragtop. Factory Rally wheels with updated redline radials give it a sporty period look without upsetting the luxury car ride.", "A big, handsome convertible with V8 power, a 4-speed, and no stories, all at a bargain price. Pretty hard to go wrong with that. Call today!"], "Exterior:": "White", "Transmission:": "Manual", "Mileage:": "97048"}}
