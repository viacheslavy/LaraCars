The first impression screams restomod, and features like the custom elongated body, modern racecar interior, supercharged 502ci V8 let you know this is 100% a custom build... and you 100% want it.  And did we mention celebrity ownership?", "''Wow.'' That's all most people manage to say when they see this one because a build this unique instantly takes your breath away.  It starts with a design you always wished the 1971 Mustang could be.  It was one of Ford's longest Mustangs ever, and this custom build actually even adds to that total.  But in the process the front end gets custom and fully integrated.  Plus, the sleek slope of the fastback rear is now met with much more dramatic integrated spoiler.  And as you see the line for both of these elements develop staring at the rear window, you realize this classic American has an Italian exotic's level of elegance.  Adding to this glamor factory is showroom-ready application of Pepper Gray Metallic.  Add in black stripes, and it's the color of the last Eleanor \u2013 which makes sense because this car is a star. This is the kind of full custom build that you can stare at for hours.  After all, it has so many custom pieces like the power bulge hood, blacked-out billet grille, hood pins, Shelby taillights, Colorado Customs wheels, and so much more.  And just in case this one didn't already excite, just know that this coupe belonged to All-Star third basemen Evan Longoria.", "The black of the grille and custom stripes on the outside are the perfect complement to introduce the full black interior.  And the moment you spot the swing-out supports for the roll bars, you know this coupe means business.  Sparco Italian leather racing seats, five-point harnesses, and the back seat space taken up by the rest of the 10-point cage finish off this race-ready packaging.  As your hand grips the Momo steering wheel, and you right one perfectly falls on the Hurst shifter, this instantly lets you senses know you're in for a wild wire in this pony car.  It starts up with a roar and a woosh as the full set of AutoMeter Pro-Comp gauges begin to dance.  But any time this is not the right soundtrack for you, an Alpine AM/FM/CD stereo connected to a 700-watt speaker system has the power to give you whatever tunes you want.", "Then again, you may never even want to leave your garage because the engine bay will have you mesmerized.  In fact, you better have sunglasses before you open the hood.  With every polished component imaginable reflecting off of the smooth painted side walls, you know there was the kind of money invested in just the shine that would rival what some people spend on their whole vehicle.  And beneath this style is a ton of substance.  Because while there are running ponies on the valve covers, this one is really massive bow tie power.  You're looking at Chevrolet's gigantic and stout 502 cubic-inch RamJet big block V8 with fuel injection.  And if earth-shattering displacement wasn't enough, you also have a Vortech supercharger.  That means it's estimated at a supercar-level 725 horsepower.  Best of all, you have complete control over this monstrous motor thanks to the six-speed manual transmission. And while the motor has you hypnotized, don't forget to check out the undercarriage photos.  There you'll spot one of the cleanest builds around thanks to less than 700 miles on this whole car.  Plus, it has a strong custom chassis by Art Morrison that includes a Mustang II style independent front suspension with tubular A-arms and a triangulated four-link in the rear.  It offers a truly superior driving experience with adjustable coilovers and Baer vented & slotted disc brakes at each wheel.", "With so much time, money, and components in this build, we just don't have the space to go over everything.  So give us a call for all the details and maintenance records.  But while you're dreaming of this amazing custom build, just know that it has the nicknamed the ''Machstang.'' You'll need to know that because so many foreign exotic car owners will want to know what just passed them!  Don't miss this one-of-a-kind.

At the height of the recession in 2009-2011, Mr. Sheldon decided to sell his huge business and move back to South Africa.

Please take a look at Hagerty values which have taken a sharp upward turn on 6-cyl 280SE's, both low and high grills.  We expect this to continue it's sharp increase as the 3.5's are becoming less and less affordable, it makes the 6-Cyl's a bargain, as we've witnessed the Gullwings and Roadsters of 1950's prices, and their more affordable version, the 190SL's taking a steep rise in their prices.", "All mechanicals were gone thru, expansive cosmetic restoration to the level of Pebble Beach.

Car was purchased from Mr. Sheldon in 2010 and brought to completion by the efforts of Tony Wahl at Tony's German Auto and his knowledgeable wife, Linda.  Tony is considered by many the most respected Classic MBZ mechanic in the country if not in the world.   Some 40 years+ of experience on ONLY classical Mercedes benz has taken to make him on of the greatest master mechanics in the world.  Tony supervised the entire completion job which took over one  year.  There are just too many items to list here.  Parts were purchased from various sources including MBZ Classic Center, Sun Valley MBZ, Miller's, as well as some custom fabrication on some metal parts which did not exist at an astronomical rates.  There's nothing cheap about restoring a 1960's-1970's Mercedes Benz.  By the same token, I don't feel that Hagerty prices are a good justification.  When people ask me that the value on Hagerty is only XXX Amount of dollars, far below what it takes realistically to do this type of project, my answer is simple:  Please go to Hagerty Headquarters and I'm certain they have at least 10 of these cars lined up at their prices.   Reality is you can buy one that's in need of repairs and restorations and easily spend $70-$100K, or buy one that's already done, still in substantial savings.", "For detailed questions, or an in-person inspection, please contact Ray at 949-395-2339"], "Exterior:": "Silver", "Condition:": "Excellent", "Transmission:": "Auto"}},

So when you can find one with all the right investments and care over all these decades, you know you're looking at something special.", "This Chevy is believed to be a Florida car all its life.  It has had four owners who have seemed to have loved it correctly.  After all, you cannot survive 60+ years and look this complete, unless you were often given the good spot in the garage, and there were plenty of the right investment along the way.  And speaking of investments, you know that black paint was a solid one.  It shines so boldly in the pictures, and this more modern application looks even better in person.  Plus, the way the light rolls off it, this makes for a terrific way to showcase how well the sheetmetal fits and how beautifully rounded the curves of the rear fenders are.  With paint and body like this, only the best brightwork will do.  Freshly re-dipped bumpers keep those chrome kings mirror-like.  And everything is just as bright and complete everywhere else, including the wide toothy grille, full-length trim, and factory wheel covers.  Possibly the most sought-after piece of trim is the bright hood ornament that reminds us all that this is the beginning of the jet age.  All of this makes the car so distinctive today.", "Inside there have been nice investments to make this feel like a time capsule.  The option lists were a lot shorter in 1954, which gives this car an uncluttered appearance of a simpler time.  The steering column is uncomplicated with a big wheel to help make turning a breeze.  Behind it are just two stalks \u2013 one for the turn signal and the other to shift the manual transmission.  Despite this coupe's simplicity, the gauge cluster is quite informative.  It has info for the fuel, water temperature, oil pressure, and voltage.  Next to that, the AM radio is still cranking out the tunes.  Because this is a true 1950s car, there are the traditional chrome accents on places like the doors, wheel, and the dashboard.  The two rows of benches feel like cushy cloth couches, and everybody gets to roll down their own window.", "Open up the hood, and the distinction of correctness continues.  From within the dark engine bay and beneath the oil bath air cleaner, you see the distinct glow of a GM legend.  Chevrolet only had one engine choice this year to rely on for everything from the Corvette to its pickup trucks.  The 235 cubic-inch Blue Flame six-cylinder motor provides reliable power and good torque to keep this chrome machines cruising down the road.  And while this engine is believed to be original, it was recently rebuilt to continue the tradition of reliable motoring.  For those who want to get the most out of this Blue Flame, the three-speed manual transmission is the best choice to have.  Plus, there's just a real retro cool feeling about operating the three-on-the-tree column shifter.", "There was over $30K invested in this stellar total package.  This Chevrolet 210 is a real driver that turns heads because of its vintage elegance.  It hasn't been gutted or hot rodded.  Instead, it's an honest and carefully enjoyed coupe that represents true 1950s motoring. Are you ready to write the next chapter in its history...
