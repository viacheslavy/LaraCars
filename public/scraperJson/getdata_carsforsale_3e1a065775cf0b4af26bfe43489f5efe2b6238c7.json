"91543", "description": ["This 1953 Chevrolet 3100 pickup has all the right looks for a cool vintage truck.  The Advanced Design style has matured into old-school tough Americana attitude, and oh yes, this one has the ultra-desirable five-window style.  Now you have to decide, will it be the coolest workhorse cruiser around, or a candidate for a V8 upgrade in the hot vintage truck market?  With this exceptional condition and affordable price, anything is possible.  ", "  This Chevy provides a real lesson in honesty.  Over the years, plenty of classic trucks have been filled with more features than the factory ever intended.  Instead, this one has just gone through good maintenance as it passes into its seventh decade.  The body is nice and straight, and the wood in the truck bed has been replaced to erase decades of any tough loads or rot.  The glass is nice and clean, including the optional rear quarter glass that makes this the desirable five-window pickup.  The Polo Green is the result of at least one modern respray.  It's a timeless color now featuring a clearcoat shine that will make you want to show your Chevy off this weekend.  Plus, there are hints of well-earned sophistication with the tall chrome five-slat grille, and the shine of the two-piece wheels.  It's the kind of appearance that comes with real credibility.  You could even buy this pickup today and put your company's name on the side.  It will instantly make your business look like it has decades of sturdy history, even if you just opened your door yesterday.  ", "  The interior is still working-class all the way, and clean, but that's all part of the vintage truck appeal.  The two-tone green and gold is always attractive, which is all part of the thoughtful care that has gone into this pickup over the years.  Trucks of this era had very few features, so to see the heater and radio (and have them still working) makes this a positively loaded machine! But more than just distinguished, you really like this truck because from the moment you slip behind the three-spoke steering wheel you can feel the grooves of the generations of workmen who have relied on this rolling history.  ", "  Under the hood this truck continues its theme of honest showmanship.  Chevrolet's Blue Flame six looks terrific with the big blue block and silver head cover radiating from within the dark engine bay.  Plus, this is believed to be the larger optional 235 cubic-inch motor.  That means this is the kind of classic tough truck engine that has some serious workman torque, is smooth as a sewing machine, and has a fantastic old exhaust note that chugs along like a freight train. For that added touch of period-correct fun, the motor is mated to a three-speed column shift manual transmission.   ", "  Five-window Chevys are red hot, so it's amazing such a sharp, well-sorted, and distinguished pickup is also quite affordable.  That's you know it will be gone soon.

to our Pleasanton showroom is this very impressive 1955 Ford Thunderbird 2 Door Convertible with red and white exterior paint plus a matching red/white interior.

This one also has an impressive history and it would be a phenomenal addition to any serious collection.", "This 1955 Ford Thunderbird Convertible is an older restoration that was owned for a number of years by a local Bay Area Ford dealership owner. He then donated it to the Rotary Club and unfortunately, he did not pass along very much of this classic\u2019s history or maintenance records. It then sold at a Barrett Jackson auction in 2015 to the current owner, who tells us that this one is a sensational driver with very little downside. We did find a few minor imperfections here and there, but this one is super-clean throughout and performs like a champion.", "Additionally, this 1955 Ford Thunderbird Convertible has been nicely modernized without sacrificing its classic looks and charm. The 292 V-8 paired with the 4 bbl. carburetor and auto transmission gives this one a great feel on the open road with nice acceleration and the power steering/power brakes makes it easy to handle. It is also has a 12 volt conversion already in place as well.", "Overall, this 1955 Ford Thunderbird Roadster is in excellent shape and it is ready to enjoy as a high end driver today.

This is a Widebody kit with many modern upgrades using a more modern Porsche look. The car was built on a 1974 VW Beetle pan that had under 7,000 original miles! The transformation was done by Classic Motor Carriages and has 1,200 miles on the car since the build. I have lots of documentation from the original VW and tons of receipts of upgrades done since the car became the Speedster. Similar kits start at $30,000 and that doesn't include the donor Beetle. This car is turn key and runs and drives great. Trades welcome & Financing can also be arranged with a approved credit score. The 356 Speedster is one of the most iconic cars of all time and the prices on them have sky rocketed recently. Take advantage of one you can actually afford to drive and enjoy!

"7101", "description": ["You probably just stopped to take a look at a classic 1957 Ford Ranchero that's being offered at a value price... so what you're probably not expecting is the vintage appearance is a performance-built Holman Moody 406ci V8 with triple-deuce carbs and four-on-the-floor.  Oh yeah, this is a real mean sleeper offered at a real sweet price.  ", "  When was the last time you saw a 1957 Ranchero? It's probably been a while because these pickups with car-like sensibilities are quite rare.  Ford barely made just over 20,000 of these in this inaugural year... and that was nearly 60 years ago.  Just imagine how few of these first-year Rancheros are still out there.  Now take a long look at this pickup.  It's more than attractive; it's a minor miracle all the intricate pieces are complete. The full length silver and gold streak needs truly straight sheetmetal for it to make this kind of stellar impression over the whole body.  We all love how it's the dividing line for the two-tone paint. This is a one-year-only style that has unique features like the single headlight, outward pointing grille, and thick chrome bumper.  The perfect final touch is the set of Thunderbird-style wheel covers.  It makes this one look like its more about being elegant classic than a street-eating machine.  ", "  Inside the two-tone continues, which gives the door panels, carpeting, dash, and especially the seats a great uniform appearance.  Plus, Ford's arching instrument panel is a great-looking piece of industrial design, complete with plenty of bright trim like a good '50s machine should have.  But when you spot elements like the three-spoke sports steering wheel and Hurst performance shifter, you start to awaken to this sleeper's true nature.  ", "  The engine bay makes this car worth the price alone.  You're looking at a big 406 cubic-inch V8 built by the legendary race shop Holman Moody.  The story is this Ranchero was built to be a performance machine around the late '60s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as the renowned speed shop was in its prime.  Holman Moody did not mess around when it came to serious performance, and that's why you have everything from Mickey Thompson valve covers to three sets of Holley dual-barrel carburetors.  This is a big power motor, and so the glasspack-style dual exhaust helps wake people up to this sleeper Ranchero.  Best of all, you have complete control over the H-M V8 and its thunderous soundtrack thanks to the four-speed manual transmission.  Plus, the right components have received recent service \u00e2\u20ac\u201c carbs, brakes, gas tank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that this cool Ranchero is more than just something to talk about.  ", "  This Ranchero provides you with a vintage appearance and a seriously fierce heart.  That makes for a heck of a deal that we know will make someone very happy soon.

It is hard to dispute the widely held belief that the 1932 Ford has been the foundation for more hot rods and racers than any car in history. The '32 was available with the world's first affordable V8, and they've been smokin' the tires ever since. This particular '32 fills that role nicely! Thrust is provided by a stout 350ci small block fortified with angle plug heads, a Holley carburetor, an Edelbrock Performer aluminum intake manifold, beautiful S&S headers, and MSD ignition. The abundant horsepower (496!) is sent through a smooth-shifting 5-speed manual transmission, then out to a Ford 9\" rear end supported by a gorgeous 4-link suspension with coil-over shocks. Up front, a Super Bell axle supports a disc/drum brake system with an adjustable proportioning valve. The fully carpeted and upholstered trunk compliments the interior nicely. Oh, yes. The interior. The carpet and upholstery are top-notch, but I can't take my eyes off of what must be the best engine turned dash I've ever seen. This stunning bit of jewelry houses classic Moon gauges. This baby may offer plenty of eye-candy, but you'll want to drive her every chance you get; this car is QUICK! Here's to another 85 years of frying tires!

This Survivor is a true Gem that is in fantastic condition and will make a superb addition to any garage and/or collection    This 1956 Ford Fairlane Tudor was acquired by its current owners 25 to 30 years ago from an elderly lady who owned the car at the time.

The car is powered by her original, rebuilt 292cid V8 coupled to her original Ford-O-Matic 2 speed automatic transmission. The interior is in very good condition with no rips, stains, or tears and the exterior is outstanding for an example of a 60 year old car with its original paint - truly, this car is a real find!    We have a clear title in hand and the owner is ready to see her on to a new home. Original cars in this condition are few and far between and very rare so do not let the opportunity to own her pass you by.
