Why not simply buy a finished one that's already done just the way you want it? This 1969 Chevrolet Camaro SS tribute looks fantastic in Fathom Green, carries a cool twist on your favorite houndstooth interior, as well as a sweet-running small block and manual transmission. Why wait?", "The trim tag says this one was originally Frost Green, but during the repaint, it got a great coat of Fathom Green, which is darker and more dramatic. Prep and final finish are quite good, but no so perfect you'll be afraid to drive it and the subtle color will definitely make it stand out. Few cars look better in dark colors than a first-generation Camaro, and they didn't do much to change the already awesome factory look. That means an original-style hood with chrome inserts, a subtle chin spoiler, and, of course, the famous ducktail spoiler out back. White Z/28-style stripes are practically mandatory, and they were expertly applied to give it a very correct look. The blacked-out SS grille works with the overall color scheme and the stainless and chrome trim is in excellent shape, glittering against the dark green bodywork. A black vinyl top adds a touch of formality, and it's a subtle feature that works rather well, especially with the tinted rear window.", "This car keeps things pretty stock inside, too, with beautiful bucket seats wearing reproduction dark green seat covers with houndstooth inserts. One of GM's better ideas, the stylish cloth inserts look both upscale and sporty at the same time, and the contrast with the green vinyl upholstery is a neat twist. A factory center console houses the 4-speed and there are auxiliary gauges under the dash in the usual location, but there are really no drastic modifications inside. The front seats show some minor signs of use, but the back seat looks completely unused and the carpets are in excellent condition all around. A newer AM/FM/cassette stereo radio has been installed, but it fits right and sounds decent. The trunk's been restored, too, including a snug-fitting reproduction mat and a spare tire with jack assembly.", "The 350 cubic inch V8 is what every SS wanted to have when it grew up. Not quite stock, it still looks right under the hood with its bright Chevy Orange paint and chrome accents. It lights off easily thanks to a 4-barrel Holley carburetor and Edelbrock aluminum intake manifold, a combination that was perfected decades ago, and the open-element air cleaner ensure it's getting plenty of air. Other chrome details include the water pump, alternator, and bracketry, so it has a bit of glitter to match the performance look, and power front disc brakes are a nice find on a car that runs this well. A Muncie M21 4-speed manual drives a stout 12-bolt rear and long-tube headers feed a dual exhaust system with mellow-sounding mufflers that never get annoying on the highway. Factory-style SS wheels are fitted and wear 225/70/15 Goodyear Eagle radials for a timeless muscle car look.", "Clean, straight, streetable Camaros aren't usually affordable, but this one offers a great balance of performance, looks, and price. If you're tired of sitting on the sidelines, this is the car that can get you into the game in a very big way.

Well cared for its entire life the Camaro sports its numbers matching 327 V8 that produces a healthy 210 horsepower. Put in motion by the 4-speed manual transmission and power steering the Camaro runs and drives great with nary a squeak or rattle. The clutch assembly is brand new as well as the new Hurst shifter. The original 1968 shifter is included with the car as well. In the cabin is a pair of black vinyl bucket seats and the sporty center console. The spartan dashboard features basic controls and an AM radio. Under the hood the original 327 cubic inch V8 resides as it has since 1968. This un-modified power plant even features the functioning original, mandated, smog pump. The exterior of the car is in very good condition with no signs of damage and a shiny paint surface. At some point a previous owner installed a SS style gas cap on this entry level V8 coupe. The older vinyl top looks good with a few imperfections. The trunk floor is in excellent condition and certainly does not show its age. The stock steel wheels feature original hubcaps and roll on radial white-lettered tires. Also included is the original Owner's Manual as well as the sought after original Protect-o-Plate. In ideal driver condition, this Camaro coupe is certainly a fun classic that can be enjoyed every day!
