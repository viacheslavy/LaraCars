Starting with a very original and complete motorcycle AJ would complete an extensive cosmetic and mechanical restoration of this British icon. All the bike's usable original parts were refurbished and the balance of parts came from AJ's personal collection of NOS Ariel parts.  The engine and transmission were rebuilt and tuned by AJ.","About the Ariel SQ4 MKII","In 1953, the four pipe 997 cc Ariel Square Four Mk II was released, with separate barrels, a re-designed cylinder head with four separate exhaust pipes from two cast-aluminum manifolds and a rocker-box combined with the inlet manifold. A redesigned frame provided clearance for the high-mounted, tall, car-type, SU carburetor. This 40 hp (30 kW) Square Four was capable of 100 mph (160 km\/h). It weighed 425 lb (193 kg).","A brief history of AJ Lewis:","Following World War II AJ Lewis went to work for the famed British motorcycle importer and shop, Johnson Motors in Pasadena CA.  JoMo, as they were called, was the largest Triumph and Ariel dealer and distributor on the West Coast.  While in their employ AJ became an expert at building race motors that included both motorcycles and Indy cars.  His passion was for the Ariel and Triumph brands, and he owned and tuned 2 Grand Prix racers with one placing 3rd at Daytona in 1951.  He later had two shops of his own with one specializing in speed parts and performance engine builds. Later in life he would restore the bikes of his youth as only a lifetime of experience and expertise could, winning multiple awards in the process. AJ amassed the largest supply of Ariel Motorcycles and parts in the world, which allowed him to restore bikes using original factory parts."],"Exterior:":"Maroon","Condition:":"Excellent","Transmission:":"Manual","Mileage:":"368"}}
