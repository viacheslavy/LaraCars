Silver with black interior and partially restored, the car went into storage 20 years ago and hasn't been moved since. It left the factory with an extremely rare Borg Warner automatic transmission. Only a handful of automatic DB6s were ever built. It's absolutely rust free and wears new leather interior. Factory Build Sheet included. A great buy with lots of investment potential.","Chassis No: DB6\/3006\/R","Engine No: 400\/2983","Price:$229,500"]}}
