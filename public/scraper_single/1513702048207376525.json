Sold new by Burbank Imports to a Studio City couple and owned by them 'till at least 2011 as evidenced by registrations but I think they owned it\u00a0till 2013 when we first acquired it and resold it to a local photographer. He bought it from us with around 54k miles and spent around $10000 on it mechanically. We just got it back in much the same condition. This body is fantastic no damage and no rust. Paint is presentable with the exception of the roof which has cracks through\u00a0the paint. On the rear of the car by the antenna\u00a0there's a small dent with a paint crack - I'd\u00a0guess\u00a01500 to fix but I\u00a0don't want to mislead anyone so to avoid\u00a0disappointment call the whole car for paint. Interior is superb and original. Mechanically superb and a delight to drive. No smoke on startup great oil pressure strong engine. Great gearbox with good syncros. Nice clutch steering and brakes are excellent. It's had major service work and brake overhaul within the last 4000 miles and four years. It comes with its original books original purchase order. Jaguar Heritage certificate stamped service book hand book 43 years of registrations lots of service records 12 Jaguar owners club concours event judging sheets etc. Inspections encouraged. All sales AS-IS. Sales tax and license fees due if delivered in California."],"Mileage:":"57839"}}
