This 67 Camaro is all business and meant for the strip but does have a clean title with an actual VIN. The car has been fitted with mostly fiberglass pieces which reduce weight but are also a little more forgiving than their steel counterparts. The blue paint is flashy and looks great while doing those nasty burnouts. Underneath that huge fiberglass cowl hood is a massive 468 big block. With a 4340-crank turning a set of Wiseco pistons this engine requires some serious fuel if you want it to run to its full potential. The Dart 360 heads are some of the best in the business while a set of ARP studs hold it all together. The Victor high rise intake is another great component especially with that monster Quick fuel 1050 feeds this monster the high-octane fuel it needs to run down the 660 ft.  The built 176 power glide transmission is the go to in the drag world requiring only one shift during your run. The 5500-stall combined with the TCI trans brake these 67 hits hard off the line. The bolt 12 bolt rear end has a spool with a set of 5.13 gears and Mark Williams axles this car is as close to bullet proof as is it comes. Inside is all about weight reduction and safety. The cage is carted at 8.50 with the Kirkey seat being all aluminum and a 5-point harness keeping you in the right spot. The Grant quick release steering wheel will allow for a much easier entry into the car but more importantly a quicker exit time. Options on this 1967 Big Block Camaro include Seat Belts Vinyl Seat Cover and Aluminum Wheels with Drag Radials.
