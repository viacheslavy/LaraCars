This particular example was made in GM's Norwood, Ohio factory.","Finished in silver over black, this truck's paint and trim are in overall very good condition. The truck's windows are in overall good shape, including the curved \u201cNu-Vue\u201d rear corner windows, but there are a few blemishes visible and the truck has no windshield wipers. The truck's lights, including the hooded, custom headlights and taillights, are in great condition. The truck's bodywork is straight and solid, including the cargo bed with its wood floor and green trim. The full-width, black sun visor adds an element of style to the truck's appearance. The black painted bumpers look great, especially in contrast to the chrome grille and bumper guards. The engine bay is tidy and the battery appears new.","With its 116-inch wheelbase, this truck rolls on blackwall radial tires, size 235\/60R15 in front and 255\/60R15 in back. Each tire surrounds a five-spoke Rev alloy wheel. The wheels are in very good order while the tires are in satisfactory condition.","Inside that engine bay is understood to be a 350 CID small block Chevrolet V-8 engine with a Performance RPM intake manifold and a Summit Racing air cleaner housing and filter. It breathes via dual exhausts that exit beneath the running boards. Backing up this engine is a Turbo Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic transmission. This engine replaces the original 216 CID inline six-cylinder that was installed at the factory.","This truck sports a custom interior. The black and brown bucket seats with a center console are in great shape while the black carpet and matching headliner are in satisfactory condition. A three-spoke Grant steering wheel looks fantastic while the instrument panel houses a full array of Omega Classic Instruments. The inner door panels are in satisfactory condition while the dash is in overall good order. As a touch of whimsy, a green skull tops the shifter.","Lever-action shocks are replaced by modern tubular shocks. This is the last year for the driver-side vent. Handle for side cowl vent is flat steel, not maroon plastic as it was previously. Wiper knob is chrome plated steel.  Speedometer\/odometer and horn are inoperable.","This car is currently located at our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Current mileage on the odometer shows xx,xxx miles. It is sold as is, where is on a clean and clear, mileage exempt title.","GET OUT AND DRIVE!!!","Click here to watch a YouTube video of this Chevrolet!","VIN: 9HP115510"],"Exterior:":"Black\/Silver","Condition:":"Excellent","Transmission:":"Auto"}}
