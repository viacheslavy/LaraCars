The 1967 Fastback Mustang is one of the most highly sought-after pony cars period. Rather it be a 6 cylinder or a S code 390 like this beauty their good looks speak for themselves. This rotisserie restored 67 Fastback is one of the best-looking ones I have seen. Finished 3 years ago and only showing 967 miles on the custom gauges this 67 is ready to be driven. The black paint is of high quality with the red GTA striping appearing as if it is jumping off the car. The chrome accents look especially shiny while making that black look that much deeper. Those torque thrust wheels are the perfect complement to the black and chrome while giving it an updated look. As you peer through the front set you notice this car does have disc on the front giving it plenty of reliable stopping power. Born a 390 from the factory this Pony was born more of thoroughbred if you will. Though not believed to be the original engine it is a real deal 67 390 engine and it runs like one. Upgraded with a simple MSD ignition this FE big block fires right up with better throttle response than your typical 67 ignition systems. The C6 transmission shifts out nicely with second gear being an absolute monster in this it gives a whole new meaning to fastback. Inside the red interior is in beautiful condition and really sets the car apart. The original gauge cluster has been fitted with a set of custom dolphin gauges that really give the interior a clean update. The fold down or sport deck rear seat is a cool option and one that is not only sought after but extremely useful. All in all this must be one of the nicest looking cars that I have seen. If you have been looking for the classic all American Pony car this is the one. Options on this 1967 S code Ford Mustang GT include Seat Belts Power Steering Power Brakes Vinyl Interior Aluminum Alloy Wheels with Radial Tires.
