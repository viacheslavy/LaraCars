Powered by the original 350 cubic inch V8 engine and shifted via a 3-speed automatic transmission, this \u00c3\u00a2??Vette was made to cruise!  The Collector Edition has a special paint code, only available on this edition.  It also gave special badges, and a special decal package to set it apart from the standard \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvettes.  With just over 40,000 original pampered miles, there are still plenty of roads left to be travelled on this classic Corvette.  The original interior looks like it has only been used a handful of times and shows minimal wear for a vehicle this age.  The \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvette was the last model in a long run of the C3 chassis, and was a clean break before the C4 chassis, as there was no Corvette in model year \u00c3\u00a2??83.  The \u00c3\u00a2??82 model carried the classic design, and started integrating more and more technology until an entirely new chassis had to be designed to take full advantage of what Chevrolet had planned for the Corvette.  This example is sporting the Crossfire injection system.  The interior has a very \u00c3\u00a2??disco\u00c3\u00a2?\u00c2\u009d feel; there is plenty of leather, a slick gradient pattern on the door panels and arm rest, and the signature laid-back seats that any self-respecting sports car would have.  Options on this \u00c3\u00a2??82 Corvette include: Air-Conditioning, AM\/FM\/Cassette, T-Tops, Cruise Control Power Brakes, Power Steering, Power Locks, Power Seats, Power Windows, Tilt\/Telescopic Wheel, Seat Belts, Leather Interior, Radial Tires with Raised White Letters, and Alloy Wheels.
